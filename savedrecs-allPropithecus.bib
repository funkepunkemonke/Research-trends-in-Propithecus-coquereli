Abstract = {The indriid genus Propithecus comprises the sifakas, medium-sized lemurs
   endemic to the forests of Madagascar. Traditionally, scientists divided
   the genus into only 2 or 3 species -Propithecus diadema, P. verreauxi,
   and, since 1988, P. tattersalli- with 4 or 5 subspecies in each of the
   first 2 taxa, but recent authors have suggested that many more distinct
   species should be recognized. We draw from quantitative and qualitative
   studies of craniodental traits to evaluate further the phenetic
   distinctiveness and taxonomic status of each named form of Propithecus.
   We recognize 9-10 species in the genus. The 4 or 5 species of the
   Propithecus diadema group -P. diadema, P. candidus, P. perrieri, P.
   edwardsi, and perhaps P. holomelas, if distinct- share several derived
   features, including large average body size and a mandible specialized
   for rotational chewing, and clearly comprise a closely related complex.
   The 5 species of the Propithecus verreauxi group -P. verreauxi, P.
   coquereli, P. deckenii, P. coronatus, P. tattersalli- are each highly
   distinctive morphologically and likely do not comprise a monophyletic
   group. In particular, we point out the highly distinctive cranial
   features of Propithecus coronatus, which researchers have traditionally
   largely overlooked.},

Title = {Kinematics of bipedalism in Propithecus verreauxi},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {272},
Number = {2},
Pages = {165-175},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Bipedalism is rare in primates and has evolved in two distantly related
   groups: hominoids and indrids. Although copious data are available on
   the mechanics of bipedal locomotion in hominoids and vertical clinging
   and leaping (VCL) in indrids, no research has addressed the unique mode
   of bipedal locomotion exhibited by select indrid primates. Propithecus
   verreauxi is a highly specialized indrid vertical clinger and leaper
   that uses a peculiar form of bipedalism on the ground. The objectives of
   this study were to describe the bipedal gait of Propithecus, to assess
   the influence of VCL specializations on the kinematic patterns and
   propulsion mechanisms used by Propithecus during bipedalism, and to
   compare Propithecus bipedalism with the bipedal gaits of other primates
   capable of using bipedalism. Video was collected of five adult P.
   verreauxi moving bipedally in a seminatural setting at the Duke
   University Primate Center. Duty factor, footfall patterns, joint angles
   and center of mass movement were quantified in the sagittal plane for 73
   steps. Propithecus uses a bipedal gallop, a gait unique to Propithecus.
   The kinematic similarities (e.g. large hip and knee angular excursions
   and preparatory countermovements) between bipedal galloping and VCL lead
   us to suggest that Propithecus takes advantage of specializations for
   VCL to conserve energy during bipedal galloping. Propithecus also walks
   bipedally at slower speeds. When Propithecus walks, it utilizes a
   relatively compliant gait similar to that of other primate facultative
   bipeds (Pan, Hylobates). During bipedal walking, energy conservation may
   be sacrificed for increased balance and reduced joint loads.},

Abstract = {The objective of this project was to better define the similarities and
   differences in gastrointestinal morphology present in lemur species.
   Measurements of the gastrointestinal tract of lemurs were obtained at
   necropsy from the captive population at Duke University Primate Center.
   Measurements of body length and weight, as well as gastrointestinal
   length, were recorded from five prosimian species: Propithecus
   tattersalli, Propithecus verreauxi, Varecia variegata, Hapalemur
   griseus, and Lemur catta. Photographs and measurements were used to
   obtain illustrations. Preliminary results suggest differences in
   gastrointestinal morphology among lemur species that coincide with
   differences in diet. Distinct sacculations in either the cecum or the
   colon were present for H. griseus, L. catta, P. verreauxi, and P.
   tattersalli, but not for V. variegata. The Propithecus specimens
   possessed a much greater ratio of gastrointestinal length to body length
   than the other three species. A short, blunt cecum and a shortened and
   sacculated colon were unique characteristics of the H. griseus
   specimens. These differences correlate well with a dietary shift from
   consumption of large amounts of structural plant cell wall (Propithecus
   sp.) to consumption of variable or moderate amounts (H. griseus, L.
   catta, and V. variegata). They also suggest that captive groups would
   benefit from further diet refinement in captivity. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {In this chapter, we use field-behavioral, morphometric, and
   laboratory-based data to demonstrate complex links among morphology,
   performance, and fitness. Although Propithecus verreauxi become
   ``ecological adults{''} at a very young age, skeletal growth of
   Propithecus is slow. This incongruity creates a challenge for a small,
   developing animal to move efficiently when traveling along the same
   pathways with larger adults. To explore the effects of this disparity,
   we quantified the relationships among postcranial morphology, behavior,
   and fitness in an ontogenetic sample of wild Propithecus and
   subsequently tested functional relationships in the laboratory. Juvenile
   Propithecus exhibit growth allometries and functional changes in
   locomotion related to decreasing emphasis on pedal grasping and
   increasing emphasis on thigh-powered leaping. Whereas adult Propithecus
   use their long, muscular thigh and leg segments to increase leaping
   distance and reduce collisional costs during galloping on the ground,
   juvenile Propithecus increase angular excursions and acceleration and
   use a hopping gait on the ground that reduces the number of collisions.
   We show how this juvenile locomotor strategy and other aspects of the
   ``locomotor phenotype{''} are associated with fitness. Understanding how
   variation in morphology influences variation in performance throughout
   ontogeny and the consequences of these associations on fitness should be
   a major focus of both field and laboratory studies.},

Abstract = {Alloparental behavior is documented for several anthropoid primates, but

   coquereli) at the Duke University Primate Center (DUPC). Both groups
   contained 1 adult pair, 2 juveniles, and a newborn. The adult males
   exhibited paternal behavior toward their offspring in the form of
   grooming and holding the infant, though males differed in the amount of
   time they spent engaged in these activities. Group differences in the
   proximity maintained between the infants' parents suggest that the
   relationship between adult males and females may help account for the
   variation. The presence of juveniles appeared to diminish paternal
   behavior in the group exhibiting a higher overall rate of male-infant
   interaction.},

Abstract = {The sifakas (Propithecus) include three species containing up to 10
   described subspecies, whose evolutionary relationships remain
   contentious. In particular, it is unclear whether P. verreauxi deckeni
   and P.v. coronatus populations are differentiated at the subspecific
   level. Furthermore, the taxonomic status of the recently discovered P.
   tattersalli and its phylogenetic position also require further
   examination. About 2,400 bp of mitochondrial DNA sequence data from part
   of the COIII gene, together with complete genes for ND3, ND4L, ND4, and
   five tRNAs, were used to clarify relationships among Propithecus species
   and subspecies. All analyses group Avahi as the sister group to all
   sifakas. P. diadema is placed as a sister group to all other
   Propithecus. Among the remaining sifakas, one subclade is formed by P.v.
   coquereli and P. tattersalli, while P.v. verreauxi, P.u. deckeni, and
   P.v. coronatus form the second subclade. All analyses fail to resolve
   P.u. coronatus and P.v, deckeni into separate monophyletic lineages.
   Based on pairwise distance comparisons and tree topology, we conclude
   that P. tattersalli does not represent a distinct species and that P.u.
   decheni and P. v. coronatus do not deserve subspecific rank. On the
   other hand, our analyses indicate that P.v. coquereli may well represent
   a separate species. Am. J. Primatol. 53:1-17, 2001. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {The sifakas (genus Propithecus) are large, diurnal, lemurs endemic to
   the island of Madagascar. Throughout the island, lemur species are
   particularly vulnerable to extinction due to relatively small
   geographical ranges (Martin 2000). Thus, understanding the, taxonomy of
   these highly endangered primates is essential for taking appropriate
   conservation action. For this study we collected tissue samples from 68
   wild sifakas representing various Propithecus species. Genomic DNA was
   isolated and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was carried
   out. We describe seven microsatellites found to be polymorphic and
   useful for analysis of the population genetics of sifakas.},

Abstract = {The digestibility and passage of an experimental diet was used to
   compare the digestive physiology of two Propithecus species: P.
   verreauxi and P. tattersalli. Though both animals have a similar feeding
   ecology, the captive status of P. verreauxi is considered more stable
   than that of P. tattersalli. The test diet included a local tree
   species, Rhus copallina, at 15\% of dry matter intake (DMI) and Mazuri
   Leafeater Primate Diet at 85\% of DMI. The chemical composition of the
   diet (dry matter basis) was 25\% crude protein, 34\% neutral detergent
   fiber (NDF), and 22\% acid detergent fiber (ADF) with a gross energy of
   4.52 kcal/g. After a 6 week acclimation to the experimental diet,
   animals were placed in research caging. After a 7 day adjustment period,
   animals were dosed with chromium mordant and Co-EDTA as markers for
   digesta passage and all feed refusals and feces were collected at timed
   intervals for 7 days. Digestibility values, similar for both species,
   were approximately 65\% for dry matter, crude protein, and energy, and
   40\% and 35\% respectively, for NDF and ADF. Transit times (17-18.5 hr)
   and mean retention times (31-34 hr) were not significantly different
   between species, and there was no difference between the chromium
   mordant and Co-EDTA. Serum values for glucose, urea, and non-esterified
   fatty acids (NEFA) were obtained during four different time periods to
   monitor nutritional status. While there was no change in serum glucose,
   serum urea increased over time. The NEFAs increased across all four time
   periods for P. verreauxi and increased for the first three periods then
   decreased in the last period for P. tattersalli. Results obtained
   indicate no difference in digestibility nor digesta passage between
   species, and that both Propithecus species were similar to other
   post-gastric folivores. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Sixteen dinucleotide microsatellite loci were isolated from the genome
   of Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi. All loci were polymorphic when
   genotyped on a minimum of 16 animals. The number of alleles across these
   loci ranges from two to 11. Additionally, seven of these loci were
   genotyped across a minimum of 200 animals in order to estimate
   heterozygosity and their potential for parentage assignment in this
   population. Using these seven loci, the mean heterozygosity in this
   population is 0.705, and the combined probability of these seven loci to
   exclude a random individual from parentage, when one parent is known, is
   0.996. These data suggest that these loci will be useful for estimating
   a variety of population genetic and genealogical parameters in R v.
   verreauxi populations. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss,Inc.},

Abstract = {Many lemur species are characterized by some form of female dominance,
   ranging from female feeding priority to complete female dominance,
   although this is a rare trait in primates and other mammals. The status
   of the Milne-Edwards' sifaka (Propithecus diadema edwardsi), a diurnal
   lemur, is ambiguous. Some short-term studies have found little or no
   aggression. The aim of the current, long-term study was to quantify the
   intersexual-dominance patterns of this sifaka. The distribution,
   outcome, and context of aggressive interactions were studied in four
   groups of wild sifakas. The majority of intersexual aggressive
   interactions were decided, with the loser expressing submissive
   behavior. Intersexual aggressive interactions occurred in all social
   contexts, and within all social contexts the females won the vast
   majority (92.7-96.0\%) of aggressive interactions. While aggression
   rates were low (0.22/hr), this evidence suggests female dominance. We
   propose that female dominance exists because it provides a fitness
   advantage to both males and females. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Infanticide has been observed across many primate taxa, but the extent
   of its occurrence is not fully understood due to difficulty in
   observation and uneven reporting. Several hypotheses have been proposed
   to explain why infanticide occurs in primates and whether it benefits
   some individuals within a social group. Here we report on a case of
   infanticide, followed by partial consumption of the infant, in a
   population of Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) at Mariarano,
   Northwest Madagascar. We witnessed an adult male sifaka kill and consume
   part of an infant, a member of his own social group, as well as the
   mother's reaction to the infanticide. Following the infanticide, the
   mother of the deceased infant left the social group after repeated
   agonistic encounters with the other group members. We evaluate how this
   event relates to the predictions of four common hypotheses. Further
   research on Coquerel's sifaka is needed to determine the frequency of
   infanticide in this species, and in lemurs more generally, because
   infanticide is currently poorly understood in this taxon.},

Abstract = {The silky sifaka, Propithecus candidus, considered one of the rarest and
   most endangered primates in the world, exists in only a few fragmented
   forests in northeastern Madagascar. This species faces increasing
   pressures as a direct result from loss of habitat in the form of tavy
   (slash and burn agriculture), illegal logging and mining along with
   hunting for subsistence, even within protected areas. We report a marker
   suite of 21 loci developed from genomic DNA from a silky sifaka
   collected in 2003 from Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve. Polymorphism of
   each locus evaluated in 18 individuals pooled from Marojejy National
   Park and Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve. The number of observed
   alleles per locus ranges from 2 to 7. The observed and expected
   heterozygosity were 0.389-0.889 and 0.322-0.789, respectively. The
   information revealed in this study will provide useful tools for further
   study of the social structure and population dynamics of the silky
   sifaka to facilitate conservation management in the imminent future.},

Title = {Mate-Guarding as a Male Reproductive Tactic in Propithecus verreauxi},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {30},
Number = {3},
Pages = {389-409},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Sexual selection theory predicts that in group-living mammals, male
   reproductive tactics can lead to high reproductive skew in favor of
   dominant individuals. In sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), a group-living
   primate with extremely seasonal reproduction, male reproductive success
   is highly skewed because dominant males sire almost all offspring
   despite a tendency toward an even adult group sex ratio. To understand
   the underlying behavioral mechanism resulting in this rank-related
   reproductive skew in male sifakas, we studied mate-guarding as a
   potential reproductive tactic. Behavioral observations of dominant males
   and adult females in combination with hormonal determination of timing
   of female receptivity in 9 groups at Kirindy Forest revealed that
   dominant males spent more time in proximity to females when they were
   receptive and were responsible for the maintenance of this proximity.
   Results also indicated that monopolization of receptive females was
   facilitated by both estrous asynchrony within groups and by the ability
   of dominant males to obtain olfactory cues as to the timing of female
   receptivity. Although dominant males engaging in mate-guarding are
   expected to experience various costs, there was no evidence for
   decreased foraging behavior and only a trend toward increased aggression
   between dominant and subordinate non-natal males within groups. Our
   results are in accordance with the hypothesis that dominant males use
   mate-guarding to monopolize receptive females and that it is one
   proximate mechanism that contributes to the high reproductive skew
   observed within the population of male sifakas at Kirindy.},

Abstract = {Studies of sexual selection show that both female choice and male-male
   competition can influence the evolution and expression of male
   phenotypes. In this regard, it is important to determine the functional
   basis through which male traits influence variation in male reproductive
   success. In this study, we estimate the strength and type of sexual
   selection acting on adult males in a population of wild lemur,
   Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi). The data used in
   this study were collected at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, southwest
   Madagascar. We conducted paternity analyses on 70 males in order to
   estimate the distribution of reproductive success in this population.
   Paternity data were combined with morphometric data in order to
   determine which morphological traits covary with male fitness. Five
   morphological traits were defined in this analysis: body size, canine
   size, torso shape, arm shape, and leg shape. We utilized phenotypic
   selection models in order to determine the strength and type of
   selection acting directly on each trait. Our results show that
   directional selection acts on leg shape (a trait that is functionally
   related to locomotor performance), stabilizing selection acts on body
   mass and torso shape, and negative correlational selection acts on body
   mass and leg shape. We draw from biomechanical and kinematic studies of
   sifaka locomotion to provide a functional context for how these traits
   influence male mating competition within an arboreal environment.
   Verreaux's sifaka and many other gregarious lemurs are sexually
   monomorphic in body mass and canine size, despite a high frequency and
   intensity of male-male aggressive competition. Our results provide some
   insight into this paradox: in our population, there is no directional
   selection acting on body mass or canine size in males. The total pattern
   of selection implicates that behaviors relating to locomotor performance
   are more important than behaviors relating to fighting ability during
   intrasexual contests. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The golden-crowned sifaka is considered one of the world's most
   endangered primates. To evaluate the species' current conservation
   status we established its actual distribution and abundance, and
   assessed current threats that affect its survival. Study methods
   involved direct sifaka observations and interviews to local villagers.
   Propithecus tattcrsalli's distribution is restricted to the region
   comprised between the Loky and Manambato rivers. Throughout its range,
   the species is abundant and it can even be found in small forest
   fragments, although it was never observed at elevations above 700
   m.a.s.l. Major threats to the species include habitat destruction
   through slash-and-burn agriculture, grass fires, wood and gold
   extraction, and poaching. Total population estimates range from 6100 to
   10,000 individuals, with an effective population size of approximately
   2500-4000 sifakas. Though sensitive to forest destruction, the species
   seems to be resilient to current levels of landscape fragmentation. We
   recommend the establishment of a system of protected areas throughout
   the Loky-Manambato region and the implementation of a ``Flagship Species
   Program{''} utilizing the golden-crowned sifaka as a catalyst for a
   regional Conservation Management Plan. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {Maintenance of group cohesion is of vital importance for group-living
   species. Individuals therefore need to coordinate their potentially
   divergent interests to maintain group cohesion. We studied behavioural
   aspects and mechanisms of coordinated group movements in Verreaux's
   sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), an arboreal Malagasy primate living in
   small groups. During a field study in Kirindy forest, western
   Madagascar, we studied the initiation and course of Group movements, as
   well as vocalisations used in this context, in three social Groups. We
   found that both sexes initiated group movements, but females did so more
   often, lead groups further and enlisted more followers than males. Sex
   of the leader had no effect on the probability that a group would feed
   or rest after a successful movement, however. Grumble vocalisations were
   emitted by both leaders and followers at high rates, both before and
   during group progressions, but Grumbles uttered just before an
   individual moved were characterised by a significantly steeper frequency
   modulation at the beginning of the call and higher call frequencies in
   both females and males. The results of this study indicated that
   sifakas, which evolved group-living independently from other primates,
   converge with many other group-living primates in several fundamental
   proximate aspects of group coordination and cohesion. In contrast to
   many other primates, however, sifakas did not use a particular call or
   other signals to initiate or control group movements.},

Abstract = {Habitat fragmentation may strongly reduce individuals' dispersal among
   resource patches and hence influence population distribution and
   persistence. We studied the impact of landscape heterogeneity on the
   dispersal of the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), an
   endangered social lemur species living in a restricted and highly
   fragmented landscape. We combined spatial analysis and population
   genetics methods to describe population units and identify the
   environmental factors which best predict the rates and patterns of
   genetic differentiation within and between populations. We used
   non-invasive methods to genotype 230 individuals at 13 microsatellites
   in all the main forest fragments of its entire distribution area. Our
   analyses suggest that the Manankolana River and geographical distance
   are the primary structuring factors, while a national road crossing the
   region does not seem to impede gene flow. Altogether, our results are in
   agreement with a limited influence of forest habitat connectivity on
   gene flow patterns (except for North of the species' range), suggesting
   that dispersal is still possible today among most forest patches for
   this species. Within forest patches, we find that dispersal is mainly
   among neighbouring social groups, hence confirming previous behavioural
   observations.},

   and white ruffed lemur Varecia variegata variegata, in the unprotected
   Fandriana-Marolambo forest corridor in south-east Madagascar. Published
   range maps show P. d. edwardsi and V. v. variegata present in the
   corridor, although few surveys have been conducted in this area. A total
   of 292.9 km of surveys were conducted at eight sites in the corridor but
   P. d. edwardsi and V. v. variegata were each located at only one site.
   Absence of these species at other sites may be the combined result of
   altitudinal and anthropogenic effects. Conservation plans for P. d.
   edwardsi and V. v. variegata are complicated because gaps in forest
   cover prevent dispersal of conspecifics from nearby protected areas.
   Conservation authorities should be cautious in using range maps based on
   the presumed distribution of lemur species.},

Abstract = {Coquerel's sifakas (Propithecus coquereli) are diurnal, folivorous
   lemurs native to Madagascar and one of only two members of the genus
   Propithecus currently housed in human care settings outside of
   Madagascar. This species has a lifespan of approximately 30 yr but
   minimal information exists regarding morbidity and mortality in human
   care settings. In this retrospective study, medical records, postmortem
   exam, and autopsy reports from 56 animals housed at the Duke Lemur
   Center from 1990 to 2015 were evaluated. Mortality assessments included
   age, sex, time of year, histopathological findings, major organ system
   impacted, and etiological factors. Mortality was most prevalent among
   adults greater than 2 yr of age (42.9\%) and neonates less than 7 days
   of age (30.4\%). The top four morphological diagnoses accounted for
   51.7\% of all deaths and included stillbirths (19.6\%),
   enteritis-colitis (12.5\%), failure to thrive (10.7\%), and systemic
   protozoal infections (8.9\%). The two most commonly affected organ
   systems in animals over 7 days of age were multisystem disease (30.8\%)
   and the gastrointestinal system (28.2\%). Infections were the most
   common etiology with bacterial being the most prevalent followed by
   protozoal infections. The results provide insight into common causes of
   mortality of this species and can be used to guide management of this
   endangered primate and improve longevity in human care settings.},

Abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation affect species occurrence and
   distribution in rapidly changing ecosystems. These issues are especially
   relevant on the Island of Madagascar where modern deforestation has been
   widespread and is ongoing. We investigated the occurrence of the
   critically endangered Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) in an
   anthropogenically modified landscape: the Mariarano region of
   north-western Madagascar. We surveyed four large forest sites from 500
   to 5,000 ha and 16 forest fragments ranging from 1.5 to 19.2 ha in size.
   We recorded various attributes of the visited sites such as area,
   distance to nearest large forest and anthropogenic disturbance. We
   encountered sifakas in 10 of 16 fragments and in all large forest sites,
   with the majority of encounters occurring in habitat edge zones.
   Furthermore, we encountered 19 sifakas in the matrix such as in villages
   and fields. We found that neither human disturbance, area nor distance
   to a large forest predicts the presence of sifakas in the Mariarano
   region. Our results suggest that Coquerel's sifakas are able to persist
   in highly degraded and small forests fragments, but further research is
   needed on their long-term viability in anthropogenically modified
   landscapes.},

Abstract = {Forest fragmentation is viewed as a serious threat to primates, yet
   whether or not it can disrupt food resources and cause energetic stress
   remains largely untested. I present the results of a 12-mo study of the
   feeding ecology of Propithecus diadema in fragmented and continuous
   forest at Tsinjoarivo, eastern Madagascar. Two continuous forest groups
   had higher dietary diversity and ate more fleshy fruit, but during the
   dry season, diversity was reduced and they relied heavily on mistletoe
   (Bakerella clavata). In contrast, 2 groups in fragments employed the
   lean season strategy of eating mistletoe year-round; the fruiting tree
   species that sustain continuous forest groups through the rainy season
   were largely absent. As expected, intersite dietary overlap was highest
   in the dry season. The level of specialization was high: fragment groups
   devoted 30-40\% of feeding time to Bakerella clavata, compared to
   28-30\% in continuous forest. The major characteristic of Bakerella
   clavata enabling it to be an important fallback or staple resource, or
   both, is its extended phenology. The difference in resource utilization
   between sites may have important implications for nutritional status, as
   well as ranging and social behavior, largely owing to the small size and
   high abundance of feeding patches of Bakerella. Understanding resource
   shifts in fragments can shed light on socioecological questions by
   providing comparisons between continuous forest and fragment populations
   with differing diets and resource distributions. In addition,
   understanding dietary shifts in fragments can aid in species-specific
   conservation efforts, while contributing to a better understanding of
   the considerable interspecific variability of primates in responses to
   fragmentation.},

Abstract = {We summarize morphometric data collected over a period of 22 years from
   a natural population of rainforest sifakas (Propithecus edwardsi) at
   Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, and we use those data to document
   patterns of growth and development. Individually identified, known-age
   sifakas were successfully captured, measured, and released. We found
   that body segment lengths increased faster during growth than did body
   mass, with individuals attaining adult lengths earlier than adult mass.
   Females can begin reproducing before they are fully grown, but this may
   not be common. With the exception of hand length, we found no
   significant sex difference in any adult metric including body mass,
   chest, and limb circumferences, body segment lengths, and canine tooth
   height; however, body masses of individual females fluctuated more,
   independently of pregnancy, than did those of males. We found
   considerable interannual fluctuation in body mass with single
   individuals differing more within the same season in different years
   than from season to season in the same year. Such body mass fluctuation
   may be a consequence of eastern Madagascar's variable and unpredictable
   environment in which rainfall during any selected month varies from year
   to year. Am. J. Primatol. 73: 155-172, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Investigating factors influencing infant physical and social development
   is important to elucidate primate adaptations and life history
   evolution. Infant sifakas exhibit a puzzling mismatch between dental
   precocity and relatively slow postnatal growth, but only anecdotal
   reports of infant development are available for a comparative appraisal
   of their early life history and maturation. We therefore collected
   behavioral data on mother-infant dyads of 16 infant Verreaux's sifakas
   (Propithecus verreauxi) from 3 birth cohorts in Kirindy Forest to assess
   how the infant's age, sex, mother's age, and environmental variation
   influence the infant's development until weaning. We found that somatic
   growth rates differed between the sexes, with females growing faster
   than males. Infants began ingesting solid food as early as 3 weeks of
   age, which is extremely early for a primate of this size and much
   earlier than in Lemuridae. Social behavior emerged at a later age than
   motor skills. Despite pronounced variation in the timing and occurrence
   of various infant activities, none of them differed between the sexes,
   except that male infants were more engaged in grooming others than
   females. Infant sifakas did not develop faster than other lemurs despite
   the extra available energy gained from ingesting solid food at an early
   age, but their mothers carry them for a relatively long period, perhaps
   because vertical clinging and leaping is a locomotor style that requires
   prolonged physical maturation. The adaptive significance of their dental
   precocity remains elusive, however. Thus, further studies are required
   to understand how developmental schedules have coevolved with ecological
   and anatomical factors.},

   locate the inflorescences of two subterranean parasitic plant species

   resources are found obscured in leaf litter, and sifakas spend
   considerable time on the ground engaged in what appears to be olfactory
   exploration before they locate the inflorescences. Because they are
   visually obscured and occur within a substrate that is rarely used by
   sifakas, accidental discovery of these resources seems unlikely.

Abstract = {Evaluation of the health, prevalence, and incidence of diseases in wild
   populations is a critical component of wildlife management. In addition,
   the establishment of reference physiologic parameters can contribute to
   the assessment of population risks. Complete medical evaluations were
   performed on 33 wild Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) from
   Kirindy Mitea National Park, Madagascar, during two field captures in
   June 2010 and June 2011. Each animal received a complete physical
   examination: weight, body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate
   were recorded, and ectoparasites collected. Blood samples were collected
   for complete blood cell count, differential white blood cell count,
   hemoparasite examination, serum biochemical profile, fat-soluble vitamin
   analysis, trace mineral analysis, and toxoplasmosis and viral serology.
   Fecal samples were collected for bacterial culture and endoparasite
   examination. Significant differences exist between age classes for
   neutrophil and lymphocyte count, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine
   values. Parasites detected were Callistoura sp., Bertiella lemuriformis,
   and Dipetalonema petteri. This publication reports the first complete
   biomedical evaluation of the P. verreauxi and provides a basis for

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Relationships between neighboring groups feature prominently in
   socioecological theory, but few empirical studies have focused on the
   effects of neighbors on the behavior of primates. Interactions between
   neighboring groups are most conspicuous during intergroup encounters,
   but the likelihood of encounters with neighbors can also affect ranging
   and activity patterns indirectly, and, as a result, behavioral patterns
   in areas of exclusive use may differ from those in overlap areas of
   adjacent home ranges. The aim of this study was to examine intergroup
   relations and spatial variation in home range use in Verreaux's sifaka
   (Propithecus verreauxi) during the annual mating season. Based on 230 hr
   of focal animal data collected from ten members of five adjacent groups,
   we found that behavioral patterns and patterns of resource utilization
   were not markedly different between areas of exclusive use and overlap
   areas of adjacent home ranges. Group cohesion tended to be higher in
   overlap than in core areas, but the proportion of time spent resting and
   foraging did not differ between these two areas. However, dominant males
   exhibited a higher scent-marking rate in overlap areas. Observations
   during intergroup encounters revealed that chases between males occurred
   frequently, whereas fights involving physical contact were not observed.
   We also found that the intergroup dominance hierarchy depended on the
   relative group size or the number of males in each group, with groups of
   lower dominance rank exhibiting a tendency to sleep proportionally more
   often in their core areas. The results of this study suggest that in
   primate species with a moderate level of intergroup aggression, such as
   Verreaux's sifaka, the possibility of encountering neighbors in areas of
   home range overlap does not exert strong influence on their behavior and
   resource utilization.},

Abstract = {Propithecus coquereli is one of the last sifaka species for which no
   reliable and extensive density estimates are yet available. Despite its
   endangered conservation status {[}IUCN, 2012] and recognition as a
   flagship species of the northwestern dry forests of Madagascar, its
   population in its last main refugium, the Ankarafantsika National Park
   (ANP), is still poorly known. Using line transect distance sampling
   surveys we estimated population density and abundance in the ANP.
   Furthermore, we investigated the effects of road, forest edge, river
   proximity and group size on sighting frequencies, and density estimates.
   We provide here the first population density estimates throughout the
   ANP. We found that density varied greatly among surveyed sites (from 5
   to approximate to 100ind/km(2)) which could result from significant
   (negative) effects of road, and forest edge, and/or a (positive) effect
   of river proximity. Our results also suggest that the population size
   may be approximate to 47,000 individuals in the ANP, hinting that the
   population likely underwent a strong decline in some parts of the Park
   in recent decades, possibly caused by habitat loss from fires and
   charcoal production and by poaching. We suggest community-based
   conservation actions for the largest remaining population of Coquerel's
   sifaka which will (i) maintain forest connectivity; (ii) implement
   alternatives to deforestation through charcoal production, logging, and
   grass fires; (iii) reduce poaching; and (iv) enable long-term monitoring
   of the population in collaboration with local authorities and
   researchers. Am. J. Primatol. 76:515-528, 2014. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {The comprehension and usage of primate alarm calls appear to be
   influenced by social learning. Thus, alarm calls provide flexible
   behavioral mechanisms that may allow animals to develop appropriate
   responses to locally present predators. To study this potential
   flexibility, we compared the usage and function of 3 alarm calls common
   to 2 closely related sifaka species (Propithecus verreauxi and P.
   coquereli), in each of 2 different populations with different sets of
   predators. Playback studies revealed that both species in both of their
   respective populations emitted roaring barks in response to raptors, and
   playbacks of this call elicited a specific anti-raptor response (look up
   and climb down). However, in Verreaux's sifakas, tchi-faks elicited
   anti-terrestrial predator responses (look down, climb up) in the
   population with a higher potential predation threat by terrestrial
   predators, whereas tchi-faks in the other population were associated
   with nonspecific flight responses. In both populations of Coquerel's
   sifakas, tchi-fak playbacks elicited anti-terrestrial predator
   responses. More strikingly, Verreaux's sifakas exhibited
   anti-terrestrial predator responses after playbacks of growls in the
   population with a higher threat of predation by terrestrial predators,
   whereas Coquerel's sifakas in the raptor-dominated habitat seemed to
   associate growls with a threat by raptors; the 2 other populations of
   each species associated a mild disturbance with growls. We interpret
   this differential comprehension and usage of alarm calls as the result
   of social learning processes that caused changes in signal content in
   response to changes in the set of predators to which these populations
   have been exposed since they last shared a common ancestor.},

   medioventral projections of the subcapitulum (vs without projections in
   L. intermedius) and the propodonotal shield is slightly ornamented (vs
   unornamented); in males the hysteronotal shield is completely covered by
   longitudinal striae (vs median part without striae), setae c2 are
   120-140 mu m long (vs 200-210 mu m long), and femur III has a short

   Individual group size ranged from three to nine sifakas. Two breeding
   females lived in groups I and II until 1993. A newly formed group (III)
   had one breeding female. Age at first reproduction is 4 years for
   females and 5 years for males. Gestation length is 179 days (n = 2).
   Most births occurred in June (n = 17), but infants were also born in May
   (n = 2) and July (n = 2). Nine of 21 (43\%) infants born died before the
   age of I year and 15 (67\%) died before the age of reproduction. One
   female bred in her natal group after the death of the resident male and
   the immigration of an adult male. Another two females disappeared at 4
   and 5 years of age; they could have emigrated or died. All
   5-to-6-year-old males (n = 4) have emigrated from their natal groups to
   adjacent groups. Two have committed infanticide. Five or more
   individuals were killed by Cryptoprocta ferox. Despite high mortality
   and offspring dispersal, the number of individuals in the two main
   groups remained nearly the same over the 9-year study.},

Abstract = {Mammalian gut microbes are invaluable to the host's metabolism, but few
   researchers have examined gut microbial dynamics under natural
   conditions in wild mammals. This study aims to help fill this knowledge
   gap with a survey of the natural variation of the gut nnicrobiome in 2
   wild lemur species, Lemur catta and Propithecus verreauxi. The wild L.
   catta were also compared to a captive population to discern the effect
   of habitat within a species. Gut microbial DNA was extracted from fecal
   samples collected in Madagascar and the Vienna Zoo and sequenced. The
   wild and captive L. catta had distinct microbial communities, likely due
   to differences in diet and development between their populations. The
   wild L. catta and P. verreauxi also had distinct gut microbiomes, due to
   a change in microbial abundance, not composition. Within each lemur
   species, there was abundant variation between individuals and from the
   dry to the wet season. The intraspecific and temporal microbial
   variation requires more investigation, with changes in diet a likely
   contributor. (C) 2015 5. Karger AG, Basel},

Year = {1998},
Volume = {135},

Abstract = {The main predators on large-bodied primates in rain forest are birds of
   prey and mammalian carnivores, which may require distinct strategies by
   prey for successful detection and defense. In the three dimensional rain
   forest environment with diminishing light at lower levels, downward
   visibility is difficult, and keen eyesight may not be as effective for
   detecting in-forest predators as soaring ones. It is therefore predicted
   that cryptic behaviours, where the problems of detection are shifted to
   the predator, may be used in these conditions. In Madagascar there is
   debate on whether extant eagles are a threat to the largest primate
   species, while there is mounting evidence that a mammalian carnivore,
   the fossa, impacts heavily on lemur populations. In a new approach to
   understanding the differential impact of raptor and carnivore hunting
   styles on lemur anti-predator behaviours, I analyzed ten years of
   behavioural data on Milne-Edwards' sifakas in the rain forest of
   Madagascar. I show that Propithecus diadema edwardsi responds to aerial
   predators by giving loud alarms calls with responsive avoidance
   behaviour, and by choosing daytime rest sites lower than feeding sites.
   In response to the mammal predator, Propithecus gave a distinct ground
   predator call, used higher nighttime sleep sites than daytime rest
   sites, and males were in most dangerous spatial positions during travel
   and feeding. The combination of protective travel order, high sleeping
   sites and small sleeping parties suggested behaviours against fossa
   predation. However, the dramatic `alarm call and drop low in the canopy'
   response to birds of prey is an indication that avian predators are
   feared.},

   effort and adult survival. The climate of south-west Madagascar is
   highly unpredictable compared to almost all other regions in the tropics
   with similar average rainfall, and we argue that sifaka females are
   bet-hedgers par excellence. Male sifaka, in contrast, become
   reproductively active at an earlier age than females, and are less
   likely to have long lives than females. The atypical direction of this
   asymmetry between males and females reflects a `slowing down' of female
   life histories rather than a `speeding up' of male life histories. Two
   other unusual features of sifaka biology and behaviour may be linked to
   the unpredictability of Madagascar's climate: intense local competition
   between females, and a sex ratio at birth strongly biased in favour of
   males in most years. In drought years, reproductive females must cope
   with suddenly intensified resource constraints. This, in turn, may
   strongly limit the number of `breeding slots' available over the
   long-term for females.},

Title = {Effects of aging on the biomechanics of Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus
   coquereli): Evidence of robustness to senescence},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {111},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {It is well-known that as humans age they experience significant changes
   in gait including reduction in velocity and ground reaction forces and
   changes in leg mechanics. Progressive changes in gait can lead to
   disability and frailty, defined as an inability to carry out activities
   of daily living. This topic is relevant to basic understanding of the
   aging process and for clinical intervention. As such, studies of frailty
   can benefit from nonhuman animal models, yet little is known about gait
   frailty in nonhuman primates. This study examines a nonhuman primate
   model to evaluate its relevance to understanding human aging processes.
   To test the null hypothesis that age-related changes in joint function
   and gait do occur in primate models in a similar fashion to humans, a
   detailed gait analysis, including velocity, footfall timings, and
   vertical ground reaction forces, on bipedal locomotion was performed in
   Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli), ranging in age from 5 years
   to 24 years. None of the spatiotemporal or kinetic gait variables
   measured was significantly correlated with age alone. There was a slight
   but significant reduction in locomotor velocity when animals were
   grouped into ``young{''} and ``old{''} categories. These data show that
   aging P. coquereli experience only subtle age-related changes, that were
   not nearly as extensive as reported in humans. This lack of change
   suggests that unlike humans, lemurs maintain gait competency at high
   levels, possibly because these animals maintain reproductive capacity
   close to their age of death and that frailty may be selected against,
   since gait disability would result in injury and death that would
   preclude independent living. Although nonhuman primates should
   experience age-related senescence, their locomotor performance should
   remain robust throughout their lifetimes, which raises questions about
   the use of primate models of gait disability, an area that deserves
   further investigation.},

Abstract = {Aiming to explain individual variation in gonadosomatic index
   (testicular volume per body weight), we examined the relationship
   between gonadosomatic index (GI), age, and season in a wild, seasonally

   Between 1987 and 2000, we captured and measured male lemurs from
   Ranomafana National Park in Madagascar 69 times. We used linear and
   polynomial regressions and residuals to examine the effect of season on
   GI and the effect of age on GI, after accounting for the effect caused
   by season among males of breeding age. As the breeding season
   approached, GI increased significantly, and all individuals measured in
   both the breeding and nonbreeding season had larger GI values in the
   breeding season. Among males of breeding age, we found no relationship
   between age and GI, after accounting for seasonal effects. Age, season
   and body weight fail to explain the variation remaining in GI. We
   discuss sperm competition, breeding-group composition, and the presence
   of parents as additional sources of variation in GI.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Despite the great variety of habitats in Madagascar, Eulemur has
   successfully populated most forested habitats on the island. Although
   the high dietary flexibility of Eulemur is often credited as one of the
   drivers of its evolutionary success, other behavioral evidence suggests
   a limited capacity for dietary switching. To shed light on the feeding
   strategies of Eulemur, we compared the dietary flexibility between
   populations of this genus with that of another widespread lemur taxon,
   Propithecus. We hypothesized that Eulemur would show greater dietary
   flexibility than Propithecus, which has a digestive system specialized
   for folivory, and that Eulemur living in dry forests would switch its
   diet from fruit to other food seasonally. To examine these hypotheses,
   we performed a phylogenetic least-squares analysis on 10 populations of
   Eulemur and 7 of Propithecus to assess the contribution of environmental
   variables and body mass on their dietary flexibility while controlling
   for phylogenetic relatedness. Eulemur relied heavily on fruit and did
   not show large variations in primary food over the year. Propithecus
   consumed leaves and fruits equally and exhibited considerable
   flexibility across seasons. Therefore, in contrast to our predictions,
   the anatomical specialization for fiber digestion heightens dietary
   flexibility in Propithecus. At the intrageneric level, we found similar
   ecogeographic variation; populations of both genera with heavier body
   mass consumed more fruit. As we predicted, Eulemur in drier habitats
   switched the diet from fruit to alternative food more frequently. To
   compensate for low dietary flexibility, Eulemur mostly adopts a
   power-feeding strategy by which it increases energy expenditure to
   acquire patchily distributed fruit resources.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the dietary profiles and feeding behaviors of Propithecus
   diadema diadema and Indri indri in a community of animals that reside in
   midaltitude rain forest within Madagascar's Mantadia National Park.
   Propithecus diadema diadema ate a diverse mixture of fruits, seeds,
   flowers and young leaves, while the bulk of the diet of Indri indri
   consisted of young leaves, which resulted in significantly higher levels
   of fat and water-soluble carbohydrates in foods eaten by Propithecus
   diadema diadema. Fiber values of items eaten are high ( 54\% NDF) for
   both species, though not significantly different between them. The
   preference for immature foliage by Indri indri suggests that their
   overall intake of fiber is greater than that of Propithecus diadema
   diadema, which had a high proportion of non-leaf material in their diet.
   We propose that differences in gut morphology between the two indriids
   contribute to their disparate diets. Levels of secondary compounds were
   high in certain food items, but overall they are also not significantly
   different between the two indriid diets. Propithecus diadema diadema
   exhibited a strong preference for 2 alkaloid-containing seed species,
   while no food of Indri indri contained alkaloids. In addition,
   Propithecus diadema diadema consumed a higher diversity of plant species
   on a daily/yearly basis, exhibited more feeding bouts on a daily basis,
   and their feeding bouts ( on young leaves, fruit and flowers) are
   significantly shorter in duration than those of Indri indri.
   Furthermore, Propithecus diadema diadema had twice the number of
   geophagic episodes of Indri indri.},

Abstract = {Madagascar is characterised by pronounced annual climatic and ecological
   seasonality and harbours a radiation of closely related sympatric
   primates (Lemuriformes) that exhibit diurnal, nocturnal and cathemeral
   activity patterns. We collected continuous activity data over a complete
   annual cycle from wild diurnal Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus v.
   verreauxi) to contribute detailed and comparative data: (1) to
   characterise their diel and seasonal activity rhythms, (2) to identify
   factors shaping variation in activity rhythms, and (3) to help
   reconstruct the evolutionary transition from nocturnal to diurnal
   activity. We fitted eight adult sifakas from seven different groups
   living in Kirindy forest with an accelerometer/data logger device and
   recorded their activity in 5-min bins for a total of 12 months. We
   characterise P. verreauxi as a strictly diurnal species with a
   pronounced bimodal activity pattern that briefly changed to a more
   unimodal pattern during their annual mating season (January to March).
   We documented significant annual variation in total daily activity,
   activity time, and activity level, as well as in most parameters
   characterising their bimodal activity pattern. Despite a significant
   positive correlation of the animals' activity time with day length,
   pronounced annual variation in the phase position of onset and end of
   activity in relation to sunrise and sunset times could also be
   discerned. Minor enhancing effects of moonlight on nocturnal activity
   were only found for the first 3 h of the inactivity period. Bimodality
   of the activity pattern and the additional reduction of activity time
   during the cold and dry winter months associated with reduced food
   availability can be interpreted as flexible behavioural adaptations to
   reduce energy expenditure. We therefore propose that energetic and
   thermoregulatory benefits are important factors shaping these primates'
   activity pattern.},

   predation, while species used as whole fruit sources conformed to traits
   typical for fruits that do not experience predispersal predation. Many
   of the 19 plant species from which the seed was extracted and eaten
   contained a single seed with moderate testa thickness, and fruits
   containing this type of seed were medium-sized with dry or fibrous
   flesh, moderate skin thickness, and a dull color. In contrast, brightly
   colored juicy fruits with minimally protected seeds were characteristic
   of the 38 plant species from which both pericarp and seed were eaten.
   Compared to transectwide measures of fruit availability or patterns
   restricted to whole fruit sources, fewer species of seed sources
   produced fruit per month and fruiting activity was more seasonal.},

Title = {Physiological suppression of sexual function of subordinate males: A
   subtle form of intrasexual competition among male sifakas (Propithecus

Abstract = {In contrast to most anthropoid primates, sifakas (Propithecus
   veureauxi), like many group-living lemurs, exhibit a number of features
   that deviate from predictions of sexual selection theory. Despite a
   promiscuous mating system, they lack sexual dimorphism, suggesting that
   physical combat plays only a minor role in intrasexual competition for
   receptive females. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that
   socioendrocrinological mechanisms contribute to suppression of
   reproductive function of subordinate males. For that purpose, 10 male
   sifakas from five social groups were observed for 669 focal animal hours
   for 4 months, including the mating season, in Western Madagascar.
   Concomitantly, 315 fecal samples of these animals were collected and the
   concentration of immunoreactive testosterone was quantified by
   enzymeimmunoassay procedures. Clear dominance relationships existed
   among coresident males. Testosterone levels of dominant males were
   significantly higher than those of subordinates during, as well as
   outside, the mating season. Additionally, the increase in testosterone
   levels prior to the mating season was more pronounced for dominant than
   for subordinate males. These findings are in accordance with the
   hypothesis of suppression of sexual function of subordinate males,
   probably providing dominant males with an advantage in sperm
   competition. If reproductive success is mainly determined by this
   nonagonistic form of intrasexual competition, the results of this study
   contribute an important piece to the puzzle of lacking sexual dimorphism
   in P. verreauxi. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Abstract = {The intestinal microbiota plays a major role in host development,
   metabolism, and health. To date, few longitudinal studies have
   investigated the causes and consequences of microbiota variation in
   wildlife, although such studies provide a comparative context for
   interpreting the adaptive significance of findings from studies on
   humans or captive animals. Here, we investigate the impact of
   seasonality, diet, group membership, sex, age, and reproductive state on
   gut microbiota composition in a wild population of group-living,
   frugi-folivorous primates, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi).
   We repeatedly sampled 32 individually recognizable animals from eight
   adjacent groups over the course of two different climatic seasons. We
   used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to determine the
   microbiota composition of 187 fecal samples. We demonstrate a clear
   pattern of seasonal variation in the intestinal microbiota, especially
   affecting the Firmicutes-Bacteroidetes ratio, which may be driven by
   seasonal differences in diet. The relative abundances of certain
   polysaccharide-fermenting taxa, for example, Lachnospiraceae, were
   correlated with fruit and fiber consumption. Additionally, group
   membership influenced microbiota composition independent of season, but
   further studies are needed to determine whether this pattern is driven
   by group divergences in diet, social contacts, or genetic factors. In
   accordance with findings in other wild mammals and primates with
   seasonally fluctuating food availability, we demonstrate seasonal
   variation in the microbiota of wild Verreaux's sifakas, which may be
   driven by food availability. This study adds to mounting evidence that
   variation in the intestinal microbiota may play an important role in the
   ability of primates to cope with seasonal variation in food
   availability.},

Abstract = {Reconciliation is defined as the first postconflict affinitive contact
   between former opponents. While reconciliation in anthropoid primates
   has been widely investigated, few studies have focused on postconflict
   mechanisms in prosimians, and only in captivity. Unlike anthropoids,
   Malagasy prosimians show female dominance, lack of sexual dimorphism and
   seasonal breeding. However, they share features with anthropoids such as
   cohesive societies, female philopatry and individual recognition.
   Comparing social prosimians with anthropoids is crucial for
   understanding the evolution of reconciliation dynamics. Here we present
   the first study on reconciliation in a wild prosimian. We focused on the
   Propithecus verreauxi (sifaka) of the Berenty forest (southern
   Madagascar). We examined postconflict behaviour in the light of
   theoretical expectations based on potential costs and benefits of the
   individuals involved. Our results indicate that P. verreauxi can
   evaluate possible risks and benefits of engaging in postconflict
   reunions. Victims were most likely to interact affinitively with the
   aggressor after low-intensity aggression. Moreover, only the conflicts
   occurring outside the feeding context were reconciled. Such results are
   consonant with the fact that, in P. verreauxi, social dominance is
   translated more into feeding priority than into a framework of despotic
   relationships. In agreement with the valuable relationship hypothesis,
   P. verreauxi were more likely to reconcile with valuable partners:
   reconciliation preferentially occurred between subordinates and top-
   ranking individuals, and between animals sharing good relationships
   (high levels of affinitive behaviours). Over the short term,
   reconciliation in P. verreauxi seems to have an important role in
   reducing the probability of further attacks by the aggressor. (C) 2008

Title = {Spatial Variation in Density and Total Size Estimates in Fragmented
   Primate Populations: The Golden-Crowned Sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli)},

Abstract = {The golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli) is an endangered
   lemur species found only in the Daraina region, a very restricted area
   in north-eastern Madagascar. Its forest habitat is highly fragmented and
   expected to suffer from significant changes in the near future. The
   species is poorly known and only one census study, carried out in 2000,
   has ever been published. It is thus crucial to update the conservation
   status of the golden-crowned sifaka. before major anthropogenic
   environmental changes take place. Using the line-transect approach, we
   estimated the species density in the main forest fragments located in
   both the peripheral and central parts of the distribution range,
   including both protected and unprotected areas. In parallel, we tried to
   determine whether an edge effect could be detected by comparing
   densities at different distances from the forest edges. We found
   important variation of sifaka densities among forest fragments. The
   total species abundance is thus difficult to determine, but we estimated
   that it is likely to be over 18,000, two to three times higher than
   previously thought. However, our data also suggested that most P.
   tattersalli live in forests located in the central part of the
   distribution range and that the estimated densities in the central part
   were high (> 80 individuals/km(2)). Two forest fragments, found to host
   a large part of the total population, are currently outside the managed
   area and their incorporation to the managed area is strongly
   recommended. Lastly, as expected for a folivorous and not heavily hunted
   species, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that this
   species does not experience a clear edge effect, at least during the
   first half of the dry season. This could be due to a high resiliency to
   habitat fragmentation or to the fact that fragmentation has been going
   on for some time. Am. J. Primatol. 72:72-80, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {Propithecus diadema edwardsi combines a strategy of high selectivity for
   many food items with the use of more readily available and abundant
   foods. Selectivity is seen in relation to taxonomic affiliations of
   plants eaten, forest composition, and phenological patterns. Feeding
   time is concentrated on relatively uncommon species as indicated by high
   selection ratios. Annual and monthly dietary diversity is low, with food
   choices restricted to a relatively on ow set of species: a total of 82
   and 73 plant species were eaten by the two groups of which, only 22 and
   16\% contributed >1\% feeding time, however; these values fall with
   commonly reported ranges. Plant parts eaten varied widely from month to
   month, with over all variance in seed-eating higher than variance in
   young or mature leaf feeding. No correlations between percentage feeding
   time and food availability is significant; instead monthly feeding
   patterns are better explained by the availability of particular plant
   species, which also supports a view of high selectivity in food choice.
   In contrast to selectivity for many seed whole fruit, and new leaf
   sources, reliably abundant food sources appear to be leaves from lianas,
   epiphytes, and parasites, which were eaten in all focal months. While
   dramatic interannual differences in dietary composition in response to
   the absence of a preferred seed source highlight the interpretation of
   folivores as surviving food crunches by training to readily available
   poor quality resources, this strategy is not unique to folivores.},

Abstract = {Gene flow within and between social groups is contingent on
   behaviourally mediated patterns of mating and dispersal. To understand
   how these patterns affect the genetic structure of primate populations,
   long-term data are required. In this study, we analyse 10 years of
   demographic and genetic data from a wild lemur population (Propithecus
   verreauxi verreauxi) at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, southwest
   Madagascar. Our goal is to specify how patterns of mating and dispersal
   determine kinship and genetic diversity among animals in the population.
   Specifically, we use microsatellite, parentage, and census data to
   obtain estimates of genetic subdivision (F-ST), within group
   homozygosity (F-IS), and relatedness W within and among social groups in
   the population. We analyse different classes of individuals (i.e.
   adults, offspring, males, females) separately in order to discern which
   classes most strongly influence aspects of population structure.
   Microsatellite data reveal that, across years, offspring are
   consistently more heterozygous than expected within social groups (F-IS
   mean = -0.068) while adults show both positive and negative deviations
   from expected genotypic frequencies within groups (F-IS mean = 0.003).
   Offspring cohorts are more genetically subdivided than adults (F-ST mean
   = 0.108 vs. 0.052) and adult females are more genetically subdivided
   than adult males (F-ST mean = 0.098 vs. 0.046). As the proportion of
   females in social groups increases, the proportion of offspring sired by
   resident males decreases. Offspring are characterized by a heterozygote
   excess as resident males (vs. nonresident males) sire the majority of
   offspring within groups. We link these genetic data to patterns of
   female philopatry, male dispersal, exogamy, and offspring sex-ratio.
   Overall, these data reveal how mating and dispersal tactics influence
   the genetic population structure in this species.},

   lemurs are limited. This study compares the efficacy, reliability, and
   side effects of ketamine-xylazine, ketamine-xylazine-atropine, and
   tiletamine-zolazepam immobilization in wild Verreaux's sifakas
   (Propithecus verreauxi). In the course of a long-term study in Kirindy
   Forest, western Madagascar, eight animals each received a mixture of
   ketamine (5.32 +/- 1.71 mg/kg) and xylazine (0.56 +/- 0.19 mg/kg) (KX; 7
   males, 1 female) and ketamine (6.58 +/- 1.36 mg/kg), xylazine (1.28 +/-
   0.28 mg/kg), and atropine (0.013 +/- 0.003 mg/kg) (KXA; 5 males, 3
   females), respectively, and 14 individuals received tiletamine-zolazepam
   (7.73 +/- 1.37 mg/kg) (TZ; 9 males, 5 females). Induction was smooth in
   all protocols, but showed considerable variation in duration when
   animals had received KXA. Immobilization as well as recovery lasted
   significantly longer with TZ than with KX (P < 0.05). Occurrence of side
   effects was not significantly different between the protocols; however,
   excessive salivation, involuntary muscular contractions, and
   vocalization only occurred in animals immobilized with TZ. Heart rate
   measurement at 10 min after onset of complete immobilization yielded
   significantly higher values if the animals had been immobilized with TZ
   compared to KX (P < 0.05). Heart rate decreased from the first to the
   second measurement for the KX- and KXA-immobilized animals, whereas
   immobilization with TZ resulted in an increase in heart rate. The
   results suggest that KX produces good, but short, immobilization in
   Verreaux's sifakas at approximately 5 mg/kg ketamine and 0.5 mg/kg
   xylazine and a smoother and shorter recovery phase than 5 to 10 mg/kg
   TZ, whereas adding atropine to KX did not provide any benefits.},

Title = {The lemur syndrome unresolved: extreme male reproductive skew in sifakas

   dominance},

Abstract = {The primates of Madagascar (Lemuriformes) are unusual among mammals in
   that polygynous species lack sexual dimorphism, and females dominate
   males socially in most species. Moreover, lemur groups are relatively
   small and characterized by even adult sex ratios despite the fact that
   one male should be able to exclude other males from the group. One
   hypothesis to explain this combination of behavioral, morphological, and
   demographic traits (the ``lemur syndrome{''}) postulates that male-male
   competition is relaxed and, hence, variance in male reproductive success
   is low. Reproductive skew theory provides a framework for testing this
   and several related predictions about lemur social evolution.
   Specifically, low reproductive skew is also predicted if dominant males
   or adult females make reproductive concessions to subordinates or if the
   latter group successfully pursues alternative reproductive tactics.
   However, suitable data on paternity, demography, and behavior for a
   conclusive test of these predictions have not been available in the
   past. In this paper, we show that male reproductive success in ten
   groups of Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) was extremely
   skewed in favor of the dominant male over 9 years. Our genetic analyses
   also revealed that more than a third of all groups are effectively harem
   groups because only one male was unrelated to the resident female(s). In
   groups with two or more non-natal males, the dominant sired 91\% of 33
   infants. Together, males pursuing one of several alternative
   reproductive tactics, such as roaming among several groups or
   immigrating peacefully, sired only 11\% of infants. Thus, female sifakas
   do not control group composition by offering reproductive opportunities
   to subordinate males as staying incentives, intrasexual selection is not
   relaxed, and dominant males prevail in a tug-of-war over subordinate
   males. Because male reproductive skew in sifakas is even more pronounced
   than in harem-living anthropoids studied to date, intrasexual selection
   is clearly not relaxed, and the lemur syndrome is more puzzling than
   ever.},

Abstract = {The size and composition of a social group can influence the
   reproductive success of its members. I examined the hypothesis that
   residents actively try to manipulate group size and composition in
   Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi). I collected
   behavioral data from 21 individuals in 5 social groups from November
   2000 to March 2002 in the Kirindy Forest (C.F.P.F.) of western
   Madagascar. I investigated the affiliative and agonistic behaviors of
   resident males and females toward other group members to determine
   whether residents attempt to manipulate the costs and benefits of group
   membership. I also examined 3 cases of immigration attempts and 1 case
   of emigration. As expected, group members facilitated the residency of
   subordinate members of the opposite sex. For example, females sought out
   the subordinate males, responded to their calls, and even groomed them
   more. However, intrasexual relationships were also important for
   establishing or maintaining residency. The data, in conjunction with the
   observations of immigration and emigration events, suggest that resident
   individuals of both sexes attempt to influence group size and
   composition. I suggest that single-male groups are not the norm in
   Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi because females encourage, and males do
   not discourage, multiple males to reside in the group to increase group
   stability and to reduce the risk of infanticide.},

Abstract = {Coordination of primate group movements by individual group members is
   generally categorized as leadership behavior, which entails several
   steps: deciding where to move next, initiating travel, and leading a
   group between food, water sources, and rest sites. Presumably, leaders
   are able to influence their daily foraging efficiency and nutritional
   intake, which could influence an individual's feeding ecology and
   long-term reproductive success. Within anthropoid species, females lead
   group movements in most female-bonded groups, while males lead groups in
   most nonfemale-bonded groups. Group leadership has not been described
   for social prosimians, which are typically non female-bonded We describe
   group movements in two nonfemale-bonded, lemurid species living in
   southeastern Madagascar, Propithecus diadema edwardsi and Eulemur fulvus
   rufus. Although several social lemurids exhibit female dominance,
   Eulemur fulvus rufus does not, and evidence for female dominance is
   equivocal in Propithecus diadema edwardsi. Given the ecological stresses
   that females face during reproduction, we predict that females in these
   two species will implement alternative behavioral strategies such as
   group leadership in conjunction with, or in the absence of, dominance
   interactions to improve access to food. We found that females in both
   species initiated and led group movements significantly more often than
   males did. In groups with multiple females, one female was primarily
   responsible for initiating and leading group movements. We conclude that
   female nutritional needs may determine ranging behavior to a large
   extent in these prosimian species, at least during months of gestation
   and lactation.},

   age, sex, and hand preference indicated that the adult males both

   as a group did not show a trend in the direction of handedness. However,
   individual adult females showed consistent right- or left-hand
   preference. Younger sifakas tended toward ambipreference, suggesting
   that lateralization of hand preference is gradual, becoming more stable
   in adulthood. These findings suggest that sex and age may be strong

   changes in locomotor behaviour. P. verreauxi is a committed leaper with
   a strong preference for vertical and angled supports. We found clear
   between-group differences in support orientation and diameter suggesting
   local variation in habitat. During the dry season, P. verreauxi utilizes
   smaller-diameter supports than in the rainy season. While this
   difference cannot yet be ascribed to any single cause, we discuss the
   factors which may contribute to this result.},

Abstract = {The genetic structure of the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus
   tattersalli) was evaluated in three forest types in the Daraina region
   between the Loky and Manambato Rivers in northeastern Madagascar. This
   critically endangered lemur species, only found within this restricted
   region (similar to 1,300 km(2)), comprises populations which survive in
   forest fragments of varying size. While this remote region is already
   affected by human deforestation, the scheduled paving of the national
   road can potentially bring significant changes in the near future. In
   2006, sifakas feces from 82 putative individuals were collected
   immediately after defecation. DNA samples were genotyped at 13
   microsatellite loci to characterize patterns of genetic diversity within
   and among three sets of forest fragments representing different
   ecological types. The recent 2CTAB/PCI extraction method and the
   `comparative' genotype validation approach allowed us to significantly
   improve the efficiency of amplification procedures. We found that
   golden-crowned sifaka genetic diversity was surprisingly high despite
   its narrow distribution and the current level of habitat fragmentation.
   We used both spatial and non-spatial Bayesian clustering methods to
   determine if forest edges correlated with cryptic genetic clusters and
   found that it was overall the case. However, the results also indicate
   that migrations are possible between two of the three studied forest
   complexes despite the presence of the national road. This is probably
   due to remaining riparian and small forest patches between these two
   forest complexes. The third forest complex is more differentiated
   although some migrations/connections may still exist through non-sampled
   fragments. This strongly suggests that it is necessary to maintain
   corridors and small patches, and also to explore the genetic diversity
   of the fragments outside the protected area.},

Title = {Influence of reproductive season and rank on fecal glucocorticoid levels
   in free-ranging male Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi)},
Journal = {HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {51},
Number = {5},
Pages = {640-648},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Studies in anthropoid primates and other mammals suggest that
   reproductive season, rank, reproductive skew, aggression received, and
   social support are the major factors influencing glucocorticoid output.
   In which way these are also affecting adrenal function in lemurid
   primates has been studied rarely. Here, we examine the influence of
   reproductive season and rank on glucocorticoid output in male sifakas
   (Propithecus verreauxi), a species characterized by high breeding
   seasonality, a hierarchy among males and extreme reproductive skew
   towards dominant males. We established a fecal assay for non-invasively
   monitoring adrenal activity and collected 315 fecal samples during the
   reproductive and birth season from 10 male sifakas living in 5 groups in
   Western Madagascar. We found a significant effect of season on
   glucocorticoid output, with males exhibiting higher fecal glucocorticoid
   levels during the reproductive compared to the birth season in
   conjunction with an increase in overall aggression rates during the
   former period. Moreover, our data indicate a significant effect of rank
   on adrenocortical activity with dominant males exhibiting higher
   glucocorticoid levels than subordinate males in the reproductive season.
   However, dominant males did not differ significantly in rates of
   initiated or received aggression and rates of affiliative behavior from
   subordinates but showed significantly lower rates of submission. Given
   their highly formalized dominance relationships, we conclude that higher
   glucocorticoid output in dominant males during the 4-month reproductive
   season is likely related to higher energetic demands necessary to cope
   with the challenges of male reproduction rather than to physical demands
   of increased fighting frequency to maintain dominance status. High rank
   in sifakas may thus carry high costs, which, however, may be outweighed
   by monopolization of almost all paternities. In sum, our data generally
   support the findings on the relationship between environmental and
   social factors and glucocorticoid output found in non-lemurid primates.

Abstract = {Two infanticides occurred after a male takeover in a population of

   Special Reserve, Madagascar. The first infant was found dying from
   wounds received to the chest and groin after three adult males had
   immigrated into the group. The second infanticide was directly observed
   2 weeks later when one of the immigrant males targeted and attacked the
   infant after it was separated from its mother. The directed nature of
   the attack suggests that the infant's death was not a result of
   generalized aggression during a period of increased group instability.
   Although the sexual selection argument does not fully explain
   infanticidal events in seasonally breeding lemurs, such as Verreaux's
   sifaka, it is clear that transferring males present a measurable threat
   to infant survival and female reproductive success in this species.},

Abstract = {Infanticide might be described as a reproductive strategy employed by
   anthropoid primate males when they immigrate into new groups. But
   infanticide has rarely been observed in wild prosimian primates. For the
   Malagasy lemurs this may reflect one or more of the following: strict
   breeding seasons; relative monomorphism in canine tooth and body size;
   small group sizes; male-female dominance relations; and male-female
   dyads within groups. We addressed the following questions: Do prosimian
   males commit infanticide in circumstances similar to those in which
   anthropoids do? and Is there any reproductive advantage for a highly
   seasonal breeder to commit infanticide? To help answer these questions,
   we describe the death of a 24-hr-old infant male Propithecus diadema
   edwardsi from wounds received during a fight between his mother, her
   adult daughter, and a newly immigrant male. Interbirth intervals between
   surviving offspring are 2 years for Propithecus diadema edwardsi
   therefore, a male could dramatically shorten the time between
   reproductive windows by killing an infant. Whether this tactic would be
   favored by sexual selection cannot be addressed until more information
   has been collected on the length of interbirth interval due to
   infanticide relative to that of infant death by other causes; how social
   factors such as stability of breeding relationships affect long-term
   male reproductive success; how effective female counterstrategies are to
   prevent infanticide and/or whether they choose to mate with males that
   commit infanticide; and how often males that kill infants subsequently
   sire infants, particularly in groups that contain a resident male.},

Title = {Of lemurs and louse flies: The biogeochemical and biotic effects of
   forest disturbance on Propithecus edwardsi and its obligate ectoparasite
   Allobosca crassipes in Ranomafana National Park, southeastern Madagascar},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {From alleles to ecosystems and landscapes, anthropogenic activity
   continues to affect the environment, with particularly adverse effects
   on biodiversity hotspots such as Madagascar. Selective logging has been
   proposed as a win-win conservation strategy, yet its effects on
   different components of biodiversity are still not fully understood.
   Here we examine biotic factors (i.e., dietary differences) that may be
   driving differences in biogeochemical stocks between disturbed and
   undisturbed forests. We present the stable nitrogen (delta N-15) and
   carbon (delta C-13) isotope composition of hair from the lemur
   Propithecus edwardsi and of whole bodies of its obligate ectoparasite,
   the louse-fly Allobosca crassipes, from sites in Ranomafana National
   Park (RNP) that are comparable except for the history of logging and
   subsequent forest regeneration. P. edwardsi and A. crassipes from the
   disturbed (i.e., heavily selectively logged) site are lower in N-15 and
   C-13 relative to P. edwardsi and A. crassipes from sites that were
   minimally selectively logged or not commercially logged at all. There is
   a similar to 3 parts per thousand decrease in N-15 between disturbed and
   undisturbed sites that corresponds to a difference of nearly a full
   trophic level. Flowers from Bakerella clavata, a staple food source for
   P. edwardsi in disturbed habitats and a fallback food for P. edwardsi in
   primary forests, were also analyzed isotopically. B. clavata is delta
   N-15-depleted in both disturbed and undisturbed sites. Data from
   longitudinal behavioral surveys of P. edwardsi in RNP and other forests
   in eastern Madagascar point to significant differences in consumption
   patterns of B. clavata, with P. edwardsi in disturbed forests consuming
   almost twice as much of this plant. Depletion of N-15 in animal tissues
   is a complex issue, but likely the result of the interaction of

Abstract = {The Malagasy primate family Indriidae comprises three genera with up to
   19 species. Cytogenetic and molecular phylogenies of the Indriidae have
   been performed with special attention to the genus Propithecus.
   Comparative R-banding and FISH with human paints were applied to
   karyotypes of representatives of all three genera and confirmed most of
   the earlier R-banding results. However, additional chromosomal
   rearrangements were detected. A reticulated and a cladistic phylogeny,
   the latter including hemiplasies, have been performed. Cladistic
   analysis of cytogenetic data resulted in a phylogenetic tree revealing
   (1) monophyly of the family Indriidae, (2) monophyly of the genus Avahi,
   (3) sister-group relationships between Propithecus diadema and
   Propithecus edwardsi, and (4) the grouping of the latter with Indri
   indri, Propithecus verreauxi, and Propithecus tattersalli, and thus
   suggesting paraphyly of the genus Propithecus. A molecular phylogeny
   based on complete mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences of 16 species
   indicated some identical relationships, such as the monophyly of Avahi
   and the sister-group relationships of the eastern (P. diadema and P.
   edwardsi) to the western Propithecus species (P. verreauxi, Propithecus
   coquereli, and P. tattersalli). However, the main difference between the
   molecular and cytogenetic phylogenies consists in an early divergence of
   Indri in the molecular phylogeny while in the chromosomal phylogeny it
   is nested within Propithecus. The similarities and differences between
   molecular and cytogenetic phylogenies in relation to data on the
   species' geographic distributions and mating systems allow us to propose
   a scenario of the evolution of Indriidae. Chromosomal and molecular
   processes alone or in combination created a reproductive barrier that
   was then followed by further speciation processes.},

Abstract = {Although prosimians are greatly olfaction-oriented, little is known
   about the specifics of how they use scent to communicate. In this
   preliminary study we attempted to delineate intra- and interspecific
   differences among the anogenital gland secretions of two lemur species
   (Lemur catta and Propithecus verreauxi coquereli) using gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results indicate that the
   two species are discernible through scent. Furthermore, we were able to
   identify reproductive status using this technique. The anogenital
   secretions of the different sexes in L. catta, though perhaps not P. v.
   coquereli, are chemically distinguishable. Given this information, it
   appears that at least some lemur species can use scent marks to
   determine species, sex, and reproductive status. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {From 1984 to 1991, 126 males and females were marked and monitored in a
   wild population of Propithecus verreauxi in southwest Madagascar.
   Animals were assigned birth years, based on known birth date or degree
   of dental wear calibrated by recapture data. Twenty-one of 27 groups
   identified in 1984 persisted within stable home range boundaries, 6
   groups disappeared, and 6 new groups formed. Only males transferred
   between existing groups, although individuals of both sexes left groups
   to form new groups. The home range of the group into which a male
   transferred usually overlapped that of his group of origin. On average,
   35\% of males aged 3-6 years transferred each year. Older males
   transferred at a lower rate. Three to 6-year-old males were more likely
   than older males to transfer two or three times. Most 3-6-year old males
   transferred into groups with a higher proportion and number of females,
   whereas older males were progressively more likely to transfer into
   groups with a lower proportion and number of females. New groups were
   formed by older males, whose mates had died or who had not been
   successful in joining an existing group, and by young, nulliparous
   females. Males have rarely been observed for more than 5 years in the
   same group. Dispersal by 3-6-year-old males appeared to be voluntary.
   Females helped evict non-natal males from the group but did not prevent
   new males from joining. Age at first reproduction was 5 years in this
   population. Forced secondary dispersal may occur when maturing females
   cease to tolerate males who may be their fathers.},

Abstract = {Sixteen sifakas (11 Propithecus verreauxi coquereli, 2 Propithecus
   verreauxi verreauxi form majori, and 3 Propithecus tattersalli) were
   videotaped as they fed on leaves in an arboreal context. The hand used
   to feed and the hand used to maintain postural stability was coded. For
   each subject, the lateral bias of the hand used to feed was opposite the
   hand used in postural support. Seven sifakas displayed no bias for
   feeding or posture-related hand use, 7 sifakas displayed significant
   feeding-related reach preferences for pulling branches to the mouth (5
   left- and 2 right-hand preferences), and 9 sifakas exhibited significant
   hand preferences for postural support (2 left-, 7 right-hand preferent).
   Although these data do not strongly support the postural origins theory
   of behavioral lateralization, the modal preference pattern for sifakas
   that displayed significant hand preferences for posture and feeding
   involve a left bias for feeding and a right bias for postural support.},

Abstract = {Coquerel's sifaka Propithecus coquereli has a large but highly
   fragmented distribution. Despite its Endangered (EN) IUCN conservation
   status, uncertainties persist regarding its actual distribution and its
   presence in forests that are thought to be part of its distribution
   range. We provide here the first extensive population surveys of
   Coquerel's sifaka across a large number of forest fragments neighboring
   27 sites of its known and expected distribution range in north-western
   Madagascar, including 12 previously visited sites. During our diurnal
   surveys carried out in the dry seasons from 2009 to 2011 we observed the
   species in 26 of the 27 visited sites. Combining our results with
   previously published data, we propose a refined update of the species'
   distribution range and identify areas to be surveyed. We also recorded
   the support tree species on which sifakas were observed, and note that,
   surprisingly, P. coquereli was frequently seen around villages and in
   areas dominated by introduced tree species. Although the species was
   present at almost all the visited sites of its highly fragmented
   distribution range, it remains unclear how viable the populations of a
   significant proportion of these sites actually are. Due to political
   instability and high rates of deforestation, large-scale conservation
   actions are urgently needed. We thus (1) discuss the outline of a
   possible metapopulation conservation action plan for P. coquereli and
   (2) identify priority sites and actions.},

Abstract = {Prosimian and anthropoid females are generally thought to have divergent
   reproductive patterns, characterized by circumscribed and
   situation-dependent receptivity. This dichotomy underpins the
   traditional view that nonreproductive mating serves a social function in
   anthropoid females, distinguishing them from prosimians which, like most
   other mammals, mate only when conception is most probable. Circumscribed
   estrous cycles differ from anthropoid menstrual cycles by the presence
   of menstruation, and greater flexibility in timing and longer duration
   of receptivity in the latter: The degree to which sexual behavior is
   tightly synchronized to periovulatory events in Propithecus verreauxi
   was assessed via the behavioral, hormonal, and social correlates of
   reproduction in a free-ranging population. I collected data from two
   social groups before and during the 1990-1991 and 1991-1992 breeding
   seasons at Beta Mahafaly, Madagascar. I also conducted 644 focal-animal
   hours and collected 485 fecal samples from five marked females in the
   Vaovao and Vavy Masiaka social groups. Estrus was behaviorally
   characterized by 0.5-96-h periods of receptivity when females were
   motivated and willing to mate, the latter not always coincident with
   periovulatory events. Females exhibited age- and rank-related
   asynchronous receptivity, and in some cases, periovulatory synchrony
   within groups. Sifaka were not pair-bonded Most females mated with
   multiple males, temporally ordering partners based on male residence and
   age. Mating was limited by male mate-guarding and sexual aggression by
   males, female mate competition, and aversions to mating with certain
   partners. It was facilitated by surreptitious copulations, positive mate
   choice, and the availability of non-resident mating partners.},

Abstract = {Eighty-five sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) have been captured, marked,
   released, and monitored between September 1984 and August 1988 at the
   Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve in southwest Madagascar. Estimates are
   presented of the age and sex structure of this population and of
   age-specific fertility and survival. Using data from this and other
   studies, it is shown that sifaka tertiary sex ratios do not depart
   significantly from 50:50, but that they do differ significantly from
   those of haplorhine primates, which have strongly female-biased tertiary
   sex ratios. Two demographic mechanisms that could give rise to this
   distinction are considered: 1) intermittently male-biased birth cohorts
   among sifakas and 2) different patterns of survivor-ship in haplorhines
   and sifakas.},

Title = {Lactating Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) exhibit reduced
   stress responses in comparison to males and nonlactating females},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone that plays a principal role in
   metabolic function and stress responses in wild primates. Stressors are
   ubiquitous in environments and elicit a variety of physiological and
   behavioral responses. While stress responses are adaptive in the
   short-term, they can have negative effects when experienced over longer
   durations. As a physiological stressor, the process of lactation is an
   energetically expensive activity for mammals. Milk production increases
   water loss and increased hydration demands are amplified in mammalian
   species inhabiting xeric habitats, including lemur species living in
   northwestern Madagascar-the region for this research work. Here, sifakas
   give birth during the dry season (May-October) and wean infants during
   the subsequent wet season (November-April). The author collected fecal
   samples during the 24 weeks following infant births in 10 groups of
   Coquerel's sifaka in Ankarafantsika Park, Madagascar. The author
   analyzed the samples by comparing the first 12-week time block to the
   second 12-week time block, which corresponded to the dry and the
   beginning of the wet seasons, respectively. Analyses were based on 375
   samples collected over two birth seasons (2010 and 2011). A linear mixed
   model determined the relationships between reproductive class and
   temporal cortisol variation. The three reproductive classes had
   significantly different cortisol concentrations. Lactating females had
   lower cortisol than adult males and nonlactating females in all weeks
   postnatal. Males had significantly higher cortisol in weeks 13-24
   relative to weeks 1-12. Examining seasonal changes in cortisol
   concentrations demonstrates how lemurs respond physiologically to the
   energetic constraints of lactation during the critical life history
   stage of infant development.},

Title = {Marking Versus Overmarking: Spatial and Behavioral Patterns of Scent
   Marking in Wild Diademed Sifaka (Propithecus diadema)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Abstract = {In mammals, olfactory communication plays an essential role in
   territorial and mating dynamics. Scent depositions in various species,
   including lemurs, can be placed via marking or overmarking (marking over
   previous depositions). We focused on the role that marking and
   overmarking play in territorial defence and intrasexual competition. We
   investigated these aspects in diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema) in
   the primary rainforest of Maromizaha (eastern Madagascar). We collected
   scent marking data for five groups from April to November 2018 and from
   May to December 2019. We aimed to understand whether the lemurs
   deposited scent marks homogeneously across the home range and whether
   sex, rank, and occurrence of intergroup encounters affected the lemur's
   deposition rate. We also asked whether males overmarked adult females
   more often than other depositions, and the marking and overmarking rates
   changed between the migration and non-migration seasons. We found that
   scent marking was performed higher in peripheral and overlapping areas
   than in the home range central areas. In addition, males had higher
   scent marking rates, but intergroup encounters did not affect deposition
   rates. Males showed higher rates of overmarking and primarily targeted
   dominant females' depositions, particularly during the ``migration{''}
   season (including premating and mating seasons). Our findings suggest a
   border-marking strategy in Propithecus diadema. More frequent scent
   marking in the ``migration{''} season suggests intrasexual competition
   in males. Our results suggest that marking is associated with
   territorial and resource defence, suggesting that it plays a role in
   monopolizing females using a mate-guarding strategy and may also serve
   for males' self-advertisement to females and subordinate depositors.},

Abstract = {The golden-crowned sifaka, Propithecus tattersalli, is a critically
   endangered social lemur species that inhabits the restricted and highly
   fragmented semi-evergreen forests. In this study, we determined the
   complete mitochondrial genome sequence of this species for the first
   time. The results shows that this mtDNA genome is 17 099 bp in size, and
   comprises 22 transfer RNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal
   RNA genes, and one control region (D-loop). The overall base composition
   in descending order is A (32.91\%), C (27.07\%), T (27.04\%), and G
   (12.98\%), so the percentage of A and T (59.95\%) is slightly higher
   than that of G and C. The gene order and the composition of P.
   tattersalli mitochondrial genome are exactly similar to those of most
   other vertebrates. All the genes are encoded on the heavy strand with
   the exception of NADH dehydrogenase subunit six (ND6) and eight tRNA
   genes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the P. tattersalli exhibits
   most close relationship with P. coquereli. The complete mitochondrial
   genome sequence presented here will be useful for further phylogenetic
   analysis and conservation genetic studies in P. tattersalli.},

Abstract = {Accurate estimates of mass and size are important in a wide range of
   research questions in population and evolutionary biology, and yet such
   data are still rare for wild primates. This study presents derailed
   longitudinal data from a large population of wild indriids, and
   demonstrates links between fluctuations in body mass, environmental
   cycles, and reproduction. Understanding these links is a necessary step
   toward explaining the function and evolution of distinctive features of
   lemur biology and behavior.
   During the first 12 years of an ongoing study of the sifaka, Propithecus
   verreauxi verreauxi, at Beta Mahafaly in southwest Madagascar, 320
   animals were captured and weighed throughout the year. Adult males and
   females exhibit seasonal cycles of mass loss, with females losing
   significantly more mass than males. In 2 drought years this pattern was
   especially pronounced. Compared to lighter females, females who were
   heavier at the time of the mating season were more likely to give birth
   in the following birth season. By showing (1) seasonally greater mass
   loss in reproductive females compared to males, particularly in drought
   years, (2) a close link between female mass and fertility, and (3) an
   uncoupling of the periods of highest body mass and of gestation and
   lactation, these results suggest that energy acquisition and storage are
   critically important in the life history strategies of female sifaka,
   and that ``capital breeding{''} may be a feature of sifaka reproductive
   strategies. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {Scent-marking behavior has been well documented in many primate species.
   Three common functions attributed to scent-marking in males of
   multi-male/multi-female lemur species include: 1) advertisement of
   individual identity, 2) territorial defense, and 3) reproductive
   suppression. We examined the average number of scent-marks per hour
   exhibited daily by adult male sifakas (Propithecus edwardsi) and found
   that patterns of scent-marking changed with season, natal status, and
   dominance status. Males in single-male groups scent-marked at the
   highest rate, followed by dominant males, males of equal status, and
   subordinate males. Non-natal males generally scent-marked at higher
   rates than natal males, and adult males living in a natal group without
   a parent marked at higher rates than males living with a parent. All
   males scent-marked at higher rates in the migration season compared to
   the other seasons. These patterns were consistent with territorial
   defense and advertisement to females, and the suggestion that these
   chemical signals impart information concerning status. Since
   scent-marking behavior tracked seasons and varied with both dominance
   and natal status, it may serve multiple functions in males. (C) 2005

   primate (Propithecus verreauxi)},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {DEC 2},
Abstract = {In some primate lineages, polymorphisms in the X-linked M/LWS opsin gene
   have produced intraspecific variation in color vision. In these species,
   heterozygous females exhibit trichromacy, while males and homozygous
   females exhibit dichromacy. The evolutionary persistence of these
   polymorphisms suggests that balancing selection maintains color vision
   variation, possibly through a `trichromat advantage' in detecting
   yellow/orange/red foods against foliage. We identified genetic evidence
   of polymorphic trichromacy in a population of Verreaux's sifaka
   (Propithecus verreauxi) at Kirindy Mitea National Park in Madagascar,
   and explored effects of color vision on reproductive success and feeding
   behavior using nine years of morphological, demographic, and feeding
   data. We found that trichromats and dichromats residing in social groups
   with trichromats exhibit higher body mass indices than individuals in
   dichromat-only groups. Additionally, individuals in a trichromat social
   group devoted significantly more time to fruit feeding and had longer
   fruit feeding bouts than individuals in dichromat-only groups. We
   hypothesize that, due to small, cohesive sifaka social groups, a
   trichromat advantage in detecting productive fruit patches during the
   energetically stressful dry season also benefits dichromats in a
   trichromat's group. Our results offer the first support for the `mutual
   benefit of association' hypothesis regarding the maintenance of
   polymorphic trichromacy in primates.},

Title = {Dietary patterns in Perrier's sifakas (Propithecus diadema perrieri): A

Abstract = {Some lemur species range into only one habitat type, whereas others
   range into a variety of habitats. Because plant community structure can
   differ between habitats, dietary patterns may vary for conspecific
   groups of primates that range into more than one type of habitat. The
   goal of our study was to determine how habitat variation influences
   dietary patterns in Perrier's sifakas (Propithecus diadema perrieri)
   that range into both dry and riparian forests in northern Madagascar. We
   collected 542 hr of data on the behavior and diet of two groups of P.d.
   perrieri from 7 June to 4 August 1998 at Camp Antobiratsy in Analamera
   Special Reserve, Madagascar. We computed indices of dietary diversity
   for each group and dietary/plant species similarity between groups. P.d.
   perrieri in group I fed predominantly in dry forest (72.7\% of feeding
   records, n = 660), whereas those in group 2 fed most often in riparian
   forest (73.7\% of feeding records, n = 666). The index of dietary
   similarity (0.986) was significantly higher than the index of plant
   species similarity (0.767). Although the P.d. perrieri in the two study
   groups fed predominantly in different forest habitats, they ate similar
   food items in very comparable proportions (but not from the same plant
   species). However, based on habitat availability measures, neither group
   fed where they were expected to feed. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The introduction of Eulemur fulvus in 1975 into the Berenty Reserve and
   their recent attainment of population densities comparable to those of
   Lemur catta led us to analyze food partitioning among the 3 large
   prosimian species in the gallery forest. We assessed the diets of
   ring-tailed lemurs ( Lemur catta), brown lemurs ( Eulemur fulvus) and
   sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) from food intake measurements during 3
   successive short-term studies. All species exhibited marked seasonal
   changes in their major food categories. Dietary overlap was very high
   between ring-tailed lemurs and brown lemurs during 2 of 3 seasons,
   including the middle of the dry season. During the latter period,
   Eulemur appeared to compensate for a low quality diet by increasing the
   amount of food eaten. In contrast, Lemur fed on lower amounts of food
   and seemed more efficient at coping with fibrous plant materials. There
   is low dietary overlap of Lemur catta and Eulemur fulvus versus
   Propithecus, which exhibit by far the highest dietary diversity of the 3
   species. We discuss sustainable coexistence among them, based on
   respective dietary adaptations and potential for dietary flexibility.},

   order to evaluate intersexual social dominance and related behavioral
   asymmetries. Two hundred hours of focal sampling were conducted on two
   pairs of P. v. coquereli at the Duke University Primate Center, Durham,
   NC. Behavioral categories including approach, departure, follow, pass,
   replace, and aggression were scored and recorded. Our results show
   strong asymmetry of aggressive encounters, suggesting female dominance
   over males. No submissive signals were observed. The analysis of spatial
   relations showed that males were more active than females in maintaining
   proximity and, on average, male spatial movements could be predicted by
   female location and activities more often than vice versa. These results
   indicate a spatially central role for the female of each pair.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal variability in predation on rainforest primates: do
   forest fragmentation and predation act synergistically?},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {220-230},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Predation is a constant risk for most primates, impacting demography,
   population dynamics, activity patterns and social behaviour. Data are
   limited on both the rates of predation and its spatial and temporal
   variability. We present long-term observations of Cryptoprocta ferox
   predation on rainforest sifakas in Madagascar, Propithecus diadema at
   Tsinjoarivo (22 group years) and Propithecus edwardsi at Ranomafana (73
   group years), derived from intensive observations based on ongoing
   behavioural studies. Average per capita offtake rates are relatively low
   (0.06-0.07), but temporal variability is high (kills are clumped in
   time). This is consistent with Cryptoprocta ecology; individual home
   ranges are much larger than sifaka ranges, and individuals may hunt in a
   subsection of their range until prey density is decreased, then move on.
   These results have broad implications. First, in terms of the evolution
   of anti-predator strategies, it now becomes important to ask: (1)
   whether average or peak predation rates determine the strength of
   selection and (2) whether antipredator strategies (e.g. vigilance,
   sleeping site selection) fluctuate interannually, reflecting recent
   experience. Second, in terms of population ecology, Cryptoprocta may
   have disproportionately large impacts on the (small) sifaka groups, even
   driving groups to extinction (as observed at both sites). Third, the
   disappearance of groups has important implications for conservation.
   When this happens in continuous forest (as at Ranomafana), home ranges
   will likely be re-filled over time, whereas in isolated forest fragments
   (as at Tsinjoarivo), recolonization is less likely. Thus, conservation
   planners should consider predation as a potentially important proximate
   cause of extirpation in fragmented landscapes, even when resource
   density and quality could otherwise sustain populations. Considering the
   effects of predation can be useful in (1) decisions regarding the
   allocation of limited conservation resources, including which landscapes
   to invest resources in and (2) investigating ways to increase resilience
   of prey species.},

Abstract = {The supports utilized by Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi and Eulemur
   fulvus rufus for displacement and feeding were studied in the Kirindy
   Forest/CFPF of southwestern Madagascar. Support dimensions were
   classified in four categories (small, medium, large, and enormous).
   Support orientation was classified in four categories (horizontal,
   oblique, angled, and vertical). Comparisons between the structures
   available in the forest and the supports used by these lemurs showed
   that P. verreauxi used mainly intermediate and large sized supports and
   vertical structures for locomotion; while E. fulvus used the different
   sized supports according to their availability in the forest, but moved
   disproportionally more often quadrupedally on horizontal and oblique
   supports. Both species used small and horizontal supports to feed from.
   Comparing the two lemur species, P. verreauxi used larger trunks and
   branches that were more often vertical or angular than the supports used
   by E. fulvus for locomotion and feeding. In contrast, E. fulvus used
   horizontal branches more frequently for locomotion and especially when
   feeding.},

Abstract = {Prosimian lemurs differ fundamentally from anthropoid primates in many
   traits related to social structure. By exploring the demography of
   Milne-Edwards' sifakas (Propithecus diadema edwardsi), and comparing it
   to other well-studied primates, we explore the effect of demographic and
   life-history factors on social structure. Specifically, we compare lemur
   survivorship and fertility patterns to two published composite models:
   one created for New World and another created for Old World monkeys.
   Using longitudinal data collected on individual Propithecus diadema
   edwardsi from four study groups from 1986-2000 in Ranomafana National
   Park, Madagascar, we quantify 1) group composition, 2) birth
   seasonality, 3) interbirth interval, 4) life-table values, and 5)
   population growth estimates. The mortality, survivorship, and
   life-expectancy schedules indicate high infant and juvenile mortality.
   Fertility remains high until death. The intrinsic rate of increase and
   net reproductive rate indicate a shrinking population. We suggest that
   high mortality rather than low fertility causes the observed population
   decline. While sifaka survivorship closely resembles New World patterns,
   fertility resembles Old World patterns, i.e., like New World monkeys,
   few sifakas survive to reproductive age, and those that do, reproduce at
   a slow rate resembling the Old World pattern. This necessarily impacts
   social stricture. An adult sifaka at the end of her lifespan will have
   one only daughter who survives to reproductive age, compared to 3.4 for
   New World or 2.7 for Old World monkeys. Demography limits the formation
   of large kin-based groups for sifakas, and survivorship and fertility
   patterns do not easily permit sifakas to form large same-sex family
   groups. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Spatial memory during foraging in prosimian primates: Propithecus

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},

Abstract = {A variety of anthropoids travel efficiently from one food source to
   another, although there is disagreement over how this is accomplished
   over large- scale space. Mental maps, for example, require that animals
   internally represent space, geometrically locate landmarks, use true
   distance and direction, and generate novel shortcuts to resources.
   Alternately, topological or route- based maps are based on a network of
   fixed points, landmarks and routes so that one food patch can be linked
   with another. In this study we describe travel patterns between food
   sources for two prosimian species found in southeastern Madagascar,
   Propithecus edwardsi and Eulemur fulvus rufus. Both species are
   dependent on fruit and have large home range sizes. By comparing
   inter-patch distances, patch size and turning angles, we found that both
   species prefer nearest neighbor food patches and P. edwardsi travels in
   relatively straight lines. The amount of backtracking seen in E. f.
   rufus may be linked to their large group size and dependence on large-
   crowned fruit trees. We suggest that the goal- oriented foraging of both
   prosimian species is dependent on a topological or route- based map.
   These are rare behavioral data relevant to ecological and social
   contexts of primate cognitive evolution. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger

Abstract = {We provide a survey of a folivorous lemur, Propithecus verreauxi
   (sifaka), in the Berenty Reserve, southern Madagascar. Higher densities
   of folivores in small patches occur in either high-quality food areas or
   in less disturbed refugia. The skewness of sex ratio, which in lemurs is
   often male-biased, can be critically exacerbated in population stress.
   We predicted that sifaka would show higher densities in areas where
   protein-rich food is abundant (prediction 1a) and in refugium areas
   (prediction 1b). Owing to increased competition by brown and ring-tailed
   lemurs and decreased food production by tamarind trees, we expected an
   extremely male-biased sex ratio (prediction 2). In November-December
   2006, we counted and sexed 206 adult/subadult sifaka (49 groups) during
   daily walks in different forest zones (Ankoba secondary forest, to the
   north, Malaza gallery/scrub areas, and spiny forest, to the south).
   Sifaka may have decreased in the gallery forest to concentrate in Ankoba
   (in a sort of out-of-Malaza). The area contains protein-rich food
   (prediction 1a confirmed). Sifaka are proportionally more concentrated
   in the spiny area than in the degraded scrub forest (prediction 1b
   confirmed). The sex ratio is extremely male biased, possibly due to
   either high sifaka density, in Ankoba, or food availability reduction,
   in Malaza (prediction 2 confirmed). The sifaka population seems to be
   under stress: researchers need to resume demographic studies,
   interrupted in Berenty in the mid-1980s, to preserve in situ a species
   that is difficult to protect ex situ.},

Title = {Sexual Signalling in Propithecus verreauxi: Male ``Chest Badge{''} and
   Female Mate Choice},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Communication, an essential prerequisite for sociality, involves the
   transmission of signals. A signal can be defined as any action or trait
   produced by one animal, the sender, that produces a change in the
   behaviour of another animal, the receiver. Secondary sexual signals are
   often used for mate choice because they may inform on a potential
   partner's quality. Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) is
   characterized by the presence of two different morphs of males
   (bimorphism), which can show either a stained or clean chest. The chest
   becomes stained by secretions of the sternal gland during throat marking
   (rubbing throat and chest on a vertical substrate while smearing the
   scent deposition). The role of the chest staining in guiding female mate
   choice was previously hypothesized but never demonstrated probably due
   to the difficulty of observing sifaka copulations in the wild. Here we
   report that stained-chested males had a higher throat marking activity
   than clean-chested males during the mating season, but not during the
   birth season. We found that females copulated more frequently with
   stained-chested males than the clean-chested males. Finally, in
   agreement with the biological market theory, we found that clean-chested
   males, with a lower scent-releasing potential, offered more grooming to
   females. This ``grooming for sex{''} tactic was not completely
   unsuccessful; in fact, half of the clean-chested males copulated with
   females, even though at low frequency. In conclusion, the chest stain,
   possibly correlated with different cues targeted by females, could be
   one of the parameters which help females in selecting mates.},

Abstract = {Propithecus verreauxi is currently divided into three of four
   subspecies. Decken's sifaka, P. v. deckeni, and the crowned sifaka, P.
   v. coronatus, are believed to be synonymous by some authors, while
   others regard them as separate subspecies. The results of a survey on an
   isolated melanistic population of Decken's sifaka, known from museum
   specimens collected in Ambararatabe, as well as the results of
   additional surveys carried out within the ranges of P. v. deckeni and P.
   v. coronatus are presented. A detailed description and photographs of
   the melanistic variant are provided. The data are employed to argue the
   case for recognition of the subspecific status of the endangered P. v.
   coronatus. The consistency of sightings of P. v. coronatus to the east
   of the river Mahavavy and to the west of the river Betsiboka, and
   sightings of P. v. deckeni to the west of the Mahavavy indicate clear
   separation of the two subspecies in the lower reaches of the two rivers.
   Clarification of the status of the enigmatic museum specimens from
   Ambararatabe, representing a melanistic form rather than hybridization
   of P. v. deckeni and P. v. coronatus, lends further support to this
   argument.},

Abstract = {Sifakas (genus Propithecus) are critically endangered, large-bodied
   diurnal lemurs that eat leaf-based diets and show corresponding
   anatomical and microbial adaptations to folivory. We report on the
   genome assembly of Coquerel's sifaka (P. coquereli) and the resequenced
   genomes of Verreaux's (P. verreauxi), the golden-crowned (P.
   tattersalli), and the diademed (P. diadema) sifakas. We find high
   heterozygosity in all sifakas compared with other primates and
   endangered mammals. Demographic reconstructions nevertheless suggest
   declines in effective population size beginning before human arrival on
   Madagascar. Comparative genomic analyses indicate pervasive accelerated
   evolution in the ancestral sifaka lineage affecting genes in several
   complementary pathways relevant to folivory, including nutrient
   absorption and xenobiotic and fatty acid metabolism. Sifakas show
   convergent evolution at the level of the pathway, gene family, gene, and
   amino acid substitution with other folivores. Although sifakas have
   relatively generalized diets, the physiological challenges of habitual
   folivory likely led to strong selection.},

Abstract = {Genetic data can be combined with ecological data to study the
   demographic history of a species, identify landscape features that
   influence migration patterns, and guide conservation efforts. Perrier's
   sifaka (Propithecus perrieri) is a Critically Endangered, rare, and
   elusive social lemur living in a very restricted, fragmented landscape.
   To assess the effect of habitat loss and fragmentation on the genetic
   diversity of the Perrier's sifaka population we examined 24
   microsatellite markers genotyped for 67 samples corresponding to 42
   individuals. Perrier's sifaka shows a low current effective population
   size (ca. 52-105) and a strong heterozygosity excess, suggesting a
   historically large but dwindling population. Moreover, we identified a
   pattern of isolation by distance, typical of continuous habitat,
   suggesting that sifakas were still able to cross the grasslands between
   forest fragments in the recent past. Our study calls for a unified
   conservation plan covering the two protected areas where the species is
   still present, if not the whole area of its past distribution. Further
   studies inferring the past demographic history of Perrier's sifaka may
   confirm the population decline and shed light on its potential causes.},

Title = {Novel opsin gene variation in large-bodied, diurnal lemurs},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {` Some primate populations include both trichromatic and dichromatic
   (red-green colour blind) individuals due to allelic variation at the
   X-linked opsin locus. This polymorphic trichromacy is well described in
   day-active New World monkeys. Less is known about colour vision in
   Malagasy lemurs, but, unlike New World monkeys, only some day-active
   lemurs are polymorphic, while others are dichromatic. The evolutionary
   pressures underlying these differences in lemurs are unknown, but
   aspects of species ecology, including variation in activity pattern, are
   hypothesized to play a role. Limited data on X-linked opsin variation in
   lemurs make such hypotheses difficult to evaluate. We provide the first
   detailed examination of X-linked opsin variation across a lemur clade
   (Indriidae). We sequenced the X-linked opsin in the most strictly
   diurnal and largest extant lemur, Indri indri, and nine species of
   smaller, generally diurnal indriids (Propithecus). Although nocturnal
   Avahi (sister taxon to Propithecus) lacks a polymorphism, at least eight
   species of diurnal indriids have two or more X-linked opsin alleles.
   Four rainforest-living taxa-I. indri and the three largest Propithecus
   species-have alleles not previously documented in lemurs. Moreover, we
   identified at least three opsin alleles in Indri with peak spectral
   sensitivities similar to some New World monkeys.},

Title = {Reciprocal recognition of sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) and

Abstract = {Redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus) and Verreaux's sifakas
   (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) occur sympatrically in western
   Madagascar. Both species exhibit a so-called mixed alarm call system
   with functionally referential alarm calls for raptors and general alarm
   calls for carnivores and raptors. General alarm calls also occur in
   other contexts associated with high arousal, such as inter-group
   encounters. Field playback experiments were conducted to investigate
   whether interspecific recognition of alarm calls occurs in both species,
   even though the two species rarely interact. In a crossed design,
   red-fronted lemur and sifaka alarm calls were broadcast to individuals
   of both species, using the alarm call of chacma baboons (Papio
   cynocephalus) as a control. Both species responded with appropriate
   escape strategies and alarm calls after playbacks of heterospecific
   aerial alarm calls. Similarly, they reacted appropriately to playbacks
   of heterospecific general alarm calls. Playbacks of baboon alarm calls
   elicited no specific responses in either lemur species, indicating that
   an understanding of interspecific alarm calls caused the responses and
   not alarm calls in general. Thus, the two lemur species have an
   understanding of each other's aerial as well as general alarm calls,
   suggesting that even in species that do not form mutualistic
   associations and rarely interact, common predator pressure has been
   sufficient for the development of heterospecific call recognition.},

Abstract = {The responses of plural breeding mammals to environmental stressors are
   little understood in free-ranging populations, but recent studies of
   singular breeders suggest that ecological factors and social milieu
   influence the variable physiological stress responses observed among
   individuals. Our previous studies examining faecal glucocorticoid
   (fGC)-behaviour interactions in plural breeding male sifaka (Propithecus
   verreauxi) show that fGC elevations coincide with specific dispersal
   events, particularly the eviction of subordinates by resident alpha
   males. This study examined the utility of fGC assays for assessing the
   stress responses of male sifaka to demographic changes in the population
   during the birth season. Analyses were based on 889 faecal samples
   collected over five birth seasons from 124 adult males residing in 55
   different groups at Beza Mahafaly, Madagascar. Results show that fGC
   levels in males are unrelated to age, residence, group stability or
   rank, but are significantly and positively correlated with the presence
   of infants, annual elevations in weekly mean fGC concentrations in males
   paralleling increasing numbers of infants born annually in the
   population. These data are the first to show that in seasonal plural
   breeding species such as sifaka, elevated fGC in males reflects specific
   events related to reproduction rather than states or social context
   during the birth season.},

Abstract = {Endocrine studies of captive strepsirrhine primates suggest that

   variations in testicular function and serum testosterone (sT) in males.
   While these studies have made major contributions to our understanding

   male strepsirrhines, none have investigated how these mechanisms work
   coincidentally in free-ranging populations. In this study we used fecal
   steroid analysis to examine androgen-behavior interactions associated
   with reproduction in free-ranging male Propithecus verreauxi. Behavioral
   and hormone data were collected from two social groups during the 1990 -
   91 and 1991 - 92 breeding seasons at Beta Mahafaly, Madagascar. Solid
   phase and radioimmunoassay techniques were used to quantify testosterone
   (T) in 105 desiccated fecal samples collected weekly from seven males,
   Results suggest that 1) solid phase extraction and radioimmunoassay
   techniques were reliable and accurate methods for quantifying T in
   sifaka feces; 2) fecal T (fT) elevations spanned a. minimum of 4 months,
   peak levels occurring 1 month prior to the January onset of the breeding
   season; 3) fecal T concentrations were influenced by developmental
   factors and, among mature males, social factors associated with rank,
   intergroup aggression, and group instability. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Testing Yawning Hypotheses in Wild Populations of Two Strepsirrhine

Abstract = {Yawning, although easily recognized, is difficult to explain.
   Traditional explanations stressed physiological mechanisms, but more
   recently, behavioral processes have received increasing attention. This
   is the first study to test a range of hypotheses on yawning in wild
   primate populations. We studied two sympatric strepsirrhine species,
   Lemur catta, and Propithecus verreauxi, of the Ankoba forest (24.99
   degrees S, 46.29 degrees E, Berenty reserve) in southern Madagascar.
   Sexual dimorphism is lacking in both species. However, their differences
   in ecological and behavioral characteristics facilitate comparative
   tests of hypotheses on yawning. Our results show that within each
   species males and females yawned with similar frequencies supporting the
   Dimorphism Hypothesis, which predicts that low sexual dimorphism leads
   to little inter-sexual differences in yawning. In support of the State
   Changing Hypothesis yawning frequencies was linked to the sleep-wake
   cycle and punctuated transitions from one behavior to another.
   Accordingly, yawning frequencies were significantly higher in L. catta
   than in P. verreauxi, because L. catta has a higher basal level of
   activity and consequently a higher number of behavioral transitions. In
   agreement with the Anxiety Hypothesis, yawning increased significantly
   in the 10 min following predatory attacks or aggression. Our findings
   provide the first empirical evidence of a direct connection between
   anxiety and yawning in lemurs. Our results show that yawning in these
   two strepsirrhines occurs in different contexts, but more research will
   be necessary to determine if yawns are a single, unitary behavior. (C)

Abstract = {The human colonization of Madagascar is associated with the extinction
   of numerous lemur species. However, the degree to which humans have
   negatively influenced the historical population dynamics of extant lemur
   species is not well understood. This study employs genetic and
   demographic analyses to estimate demographic parameters relating to the
   historical population dynamics of a wild lemur population, Verreaux's
   sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi). The genetic analyses are used to
   determine whether this population experienced a historically recent
   (i.e., within the last 2000 years) population bottleneck, as well as to
   estimate the historical population growth rate and the timing of any
   changes in population size in the past. In addition, a retrospective
   demographic analysis is used to determine sources of variation and
   covariation in the sifaka life cycle and how variation in life-cycle
   transitions contributes to variation in population growth rate. The
   genetic analyses indicate that the sifaka population did not experience
   a recent population bottleneck; however, the historical population
   growth rate was negative, indicating that the ancestral population size
   was much larger than the current size. The timing of the ancestral
   population decline has a point estimate of 2300 years ago, but with
   large credible intervals: 3611-1736 years ago. This point estimate
   corresponds with the first evidence for human arrival to Madagascar.
   Climatic variation has also likely influenced past (and current)
   population dynamics due to stochastic annual rainfall patterns and
   climatic desiccation, the latter of which began in southwestern
   Madagascar around 4000 years ago. Variation in the survival of
   2-year-old animals as well as large adult females makes the largest
   contribution to variation in population growth rate. In the absence of
   more explicit models pertaining to historical population dynamics, it is
   difficult to attribute the negative population growth rate of this
   species solely to a single factor (e.g., hunting, habitat destruction).},

Abstract = {Functional studies of skeletal anatomy are predicated on the fundamental
   assumption that form will follow function. For instance, previous
   studies have shown that the femora of specialized leaping primates are
   more robust than those of more generalized primate quadrupeds. Are such
   differences solely a plastic response to differential loading patterns
   during postnatal life, or might they also reflect more canalized
   developmental mechanisms present at birth? Here, we show that perinatal
   Lemur catta, an arboreal/terrestrial quadruped, have less robust femora
   than perinatal Propithecus coquereli, a closely related species
   specialized for vertical clinging and leaping (a highly unusual
   locomotor mode in which the hindlimbs are used to launch the animal
   between vertical tree trunks). These results suggest that functional
   differences in long bone cross-sectional dimensions are manifest at
   birth, belying simple interpretations of adult postcranial form as a
   direct record of loading patterns during postnatal life. Despite these
   significant differences in bone robusticity, we find that hindlimb bone
   mineralization, material properties, and measures of whole-bone strength
   generally overlap in perinatal L. catta and P. coquereli, indicating
   little differentiation in postcranial maturity at birth despite known
   differences in the pace of craniodental development between the species.
   In a broader perspective, our results likely reflect evolution acting
   during prenatal ontogeny. Even though primates are notable for
   relatively prolonged gestation and postnatal parental care, neonates are
   not buffered from selection, perhaps especially in the unpredictable and
   volatile environment of Madagascar. Anat Rec, 2018. (c) 2018 Wiley

Abstract = {Morphological integration manifests as strong phenotypic covariation
   among interacting traits. In this study, a graph-theory approach is used
   to analyze patterns of morphological integration in a wild population of
   Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi). The motivation for
   this study is to determine the relative roles of development versus
   function in shaping patterns of morphological integration in the sifaka
   postcranium. A developmental and a functional hypothesis of integration
   are compared with the observed pattern of integration and the fit of
   these hypotheses is assessed using information theoretic statistics.
   Correlational selection is also estimated on limb elements. Information
   theoretic statistics indicate that the developmental hypothesis fits the
   observed pattern of integration slightly better than the functional
   hypothesis. Only two pairs of traits experience correlational selection
   but neither of the traits within each pair are morphologically
   integrated. The observed pattern of integration contains several
   trait-trait associations that are specified by both the functional and
   developmental hypotheses. These results likely reflect the nested
   covariation structure in which a novel locomotor mode, vertical clinging
   and leaping, is derived from a primitive quadrupedal morphotype.},

Title = {Female Power in Verreaux's Sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) Is Based on
   Maturity, Not Body Size},

Abstract = {Conflicts between individuals are common among animals, with power
   dynamics often biased toward a particular sex. However, individuals
   across species exert power differently depending on the primary source
   of that power. Dominance-based power depends on fighting ability (e.g.,
   greater body size) whereas leverage-based power depends on resources
   that cannot be taken by force (e.g., mating opportunities). Both can
   change in relative importance during development. We examined the
   development and base of female-biased power structures in Verreaux's
   sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) by analyzing the effects of reproductive
   maturity and body mass on intersexual conflict outcomes. We used data on
   four social groups at Ankoatsifaka Research Station in Kirindy Mitea
   National Park collected from 2007 to 2016, which included 483 decided
   agonistic encounters with both behavioral and morphometric data
   available. We used generalized linear mixed models to examine the
   effects of age, body mass, and female reproductive maturity on conflict
   outcome. Power relationships between mature females and males were
   unambiguously female biased. Female reproductive maturity, and not body
   mass, predicted intersexual conflict outcomes. Once reproductively
   mature, females almost never lost to males, except when females had not
   yet had an infant survive past weaning. Our results are thus consistent
   with the hypothesis that female leverage characterizes social structures
   of adult Verreaux's sifaka more than female dominance. Future studies
   are needed to explore the influence of other sources of leverage and
   dominance, however. Similar studies in other primate species will
   clarify the role of what is often called ``dominance{''} but may
   actually be leverage-based power.},

Abstract = {Mammals that live in seasonal environments may adjust their reproductive
   cycles to COPE! with fluctuations in food availability. Because lemurs
   in Madagascar experience highly seasonal variation in food availability,
   we examined the effects of fluctuating food availability on body
   condition and reproduction in one of the larger living species,
   Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi), in the Kirindy
   Forest of western Madagascar. Seven years of demographic data were
   combined with an intensive study of 25 individuals over the course of 18
   months. In contrast to other populations of Verreaux's sifaka, females
   were found to have greater body mass than males. Both male and female
   sifaka exhibited significant losses of body mass and fat during the dry
   season. Females were more likely to give birth and successfully wean an
   infant when they had higher body mass during the mating season. They
   mated during the periods of high and declining food availability, gave
   birth during the lean season, and then timed mid/late lactation with the
   period of increasing food availability. Thus, we conclude that sifaka
   follow the ``classic{''} reproductive strategy (sensu van Schaik and win

Year = {1995},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {313-325},
Abstract = {Solid phase extraction, high performance liquid chromatography, and
   radioimmunoassay were used to test the validity of fecal steroid
   analysis for assessing ovarian function in sifaka (Propithecus
   verreauxi). Daily fecal samples were collected over a 4 month period
   from two cycling female sifaka, and single samples were collected from
   females during normal gestation and males while housed at the Duke
   University Primate Center. Tests of radioimmunoassay validity indicated
   that solid phase extraction and microradioimmunoassay techniques were
   reliable and accurate methods for quantifying ovarian steroids in sifaka
   feces. The progesterone (P-4) antibody specifically quantitated only
   P-4, while several estrogen metabolites made small contributions to
   immunoreactive measures of estradiol (E(2)). A 1:10 dilution reduced
   these contributions to 3-15\% of the estimated E(2) concentration.
   Although the spectral data suggested that E(2) was not the major
   metabolite present, it accounted for the majority of the
   immunoreactivity at normal assay dilutions. Fecal profiles of
   immunoreactive E(2) and P-4 in the conceptive female resembled serum
   profiles of other strepsirhines. E(2) and P-4 were elevated at the end
   of the conceptive cycle and were more markedly increased in late
   pregnancy in the two pregnant females. Mating behavior and indices of
   sexual interest were observed in conjunction with E(2) peaks, although
   not all peaks were accompanied by observations of sexual behavior. (C)

Title = {Endogenization of a Prosimian Retrovirus during Lemur Evolution},
Journal = {VIRUSES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Studies of viruses that coevolved with lemurs provide an opportunity to
   understand the basal traits of primate viruses and provide an
   evolutionary context for host-virus interactions. Germline integration
   of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are fossil evidence of past
   infections. Hence, characterization of novel ERVs provides insight into
   the ancient precursors of extant viruses and the evolutionary history of
   their hosts. Here, we report the discovery of a novel endogenous
   retrovirus present in the genome of a lemur, Coquerel's sifaka
   (Propithecus coquereli). Using next-generation sequencing, we identified
   and characterized the complete genome sequence of a retrovirus, named
   prosimian retrovirus 1 (PSRV1). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that
   PSRV1 is a gamma-type betaretrovirus basal to the other primate
   betaretroviruses and most closely related to simian retroviruses.
   Molecular clock analysis of PSRV1 long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences
   estimated the time of endogenization within 4.56 MYA (+/- 2.4 MYA),
   placing it after the divergence of Propithecus species. These results
   indicate that PSRV1 is an important milestone of lemur evolution during
   the radiation of the Propithecus genus. These findings may have
   implications for both human and animal health in that the acquisition of
   a gamma-type env gene within an endogenized betaretrovirus could
   facilitate a cross-species jump between vertebrate class hosts.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {70},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Individuals living in groups have to achieve collective action for
   successful territorial defense. Because conflicts between neighboring
   groups always involve risks and costs, individuals must base their
   decision to participate in a given conflict on an evaluation of the
   trade-off between potential costs and benefits. Since group members may
   differ in motivation to engage in group encounters, they exhibit
   different levels of participation in conflicts. In this study, we
   investigated factors influencing participation in intergroup encounters
   in Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), a group-living primate
   from Madagascar. Over a period of 12 months, we studied eight adjacent
   sifaka groups in Kirindy Forest. We observed 71 encounters between known
   neighboring groups in which adult females and males participated equally
   as often. No individual participated in every encounter, and
   non-participation occurred more often in larger groups. Females
   participated less often in encounters when they had dependent infants,
   presumably to reduce the risk of infanticide. Male participation was
   influenced by social status: dominant males participated in most
   encounters, whereas males with fewer opportunities to reproduce
   participated less often, hence male participation is influenced by the
   incentive of maintaining access to females. The number of actively
   participating individuals in the opponent group positively influenced
   the participation in both sexes. Thus, sifakas seem to decide joining a
   given encounter opportunistically, most likely based on a combination of
   individual incentives and the actual circumstance of each encounter,
   suggesting that the complexity in intergroup relationships appears to be
   the product of decisions made by each individual group member.
   Cooperation among group-living animals is often challenged by collective
   action problems resulting from individual differences in interests in
   contributing to collective behaviors. Intergroup encounters involve
   distinguished costs and benefits for each individual despite being in
   the same social group. Therefore, encounters between groups offer a good
   opportunity to investigate individual participation in collective
   action. In this study, we investigate the influence of different
   incentives on individual participation in intergroup encounters in wild
   Malagasy primate, Verreaux's sifakas. We propose a novel approach that
   takes into account the variable circumstances of each conflict, such as
   the number of individuals fighting in both groups as a predictor for
   participation. We believe that our study not only provides novel data on
   wild sifakas, but it also offers new perspectives for the interpretation
   of intergroup relationships in other taxa.},

Abstract = {Ecogeographic size variations have been documented in some but not all
   sifakas. Few morphometric or body weight data have been available for
   two critically endangered subspecies of diademed sifakas: Perrier's
   sifakas (Propithecus diadema perrieri) and silky sifakas (Propithecus
   diadema candidus). The objectives of our study were to determine size
   variations in sifakas and if these variations are related to resource
   quality and/or resource seasonality. P. d. perrieri and P. d. candidus
   were captured, weighed, and measured in northern Madagascar. Body
   weights and morphometrics were compared with other subspecies of
   diademed sifakas and indris (Indri indri). Differences in body weights
   and morphometrics between taxa are particularly pronounced for P. d.
   perrieri compared to P. d. diadema, P. d. edwardsi, and L indri. Most
   morphometrics varied in comparisons between P. d. candidus and the other
   Indriidae (P. d. diadema, P. d. edwardsi, and L indri). Average body
   size in sifakas is positively correlated with annual rainfall and
   negatively correlated with length of dry season. Sifaka body size is not
   correlated with protein-to-fiber ratios. Thus, size variations in
   sifakas are related to resource seasonality rather than resource
   quality. The relationships between the temporal availability of food
   resources and sifaka. body size reflect complex and regionally varying
   causalities. Detailed, longitudinal information on the ecological
   factors underlying food selection and nutrient requirements in sifakas
   are needed to determine the relationship between ecogeographic variables
   and body size in sifakas. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Various hypotheses to explain possible functions of scent-marking have
   been put forth and basically fall into five categories: territorial
   demarcation, ownership of resources, mate attraction, noncombative
   fighting, and self-advertisement. Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus
   verreauxi verreauxi), like many prosimians, use scent-marking as one
   form of communication. The goal of this study was to determine the
   function of scent-marking in sifaka. All-occurrence of scent-marks,
   scent-mark context, and scent-mark style were collected on 23 sifaka. in
   the Kirindy Forest of western Madagascar for 7 months (September
   2001-March 2002). Scent-mark rates were collected using continuous focal
   animal sampling from November 2000-March 2002. Home range data were
   collected using monthly censuses and instantaneous focal sampling
   throughout the 17 months. Scent-marking behavior was exhibited almost
   exclusively by adults. Scent-mark rates were not related to the number
   of resident adult males, number of resident adult females, rank, or
   group size. The majority of scent-marks occurred in the perimeter of the
   home range; however, less than a quarter of the home range was used by
   only a single group. Sifaka did not preferentially mark food trees, mark
   during the mating season, or mark during intergroup encounters. The
   results from this study indicate that none of the five hypothesized
   functions best explains all scent-marking in Verreaux's sifaka. Rather,
   scent-marking may serve different functions for different individuals.},

Title = {Females Are the Ecological Sex: Sex-Specific Body Mass Ecogeography in

Abstract = {Previous work in primates has shown that body size often covaries with
   ecological parameters related to resource or energy availability in the
   environment. This relationship may differ for males and females as
   access to resources has greater importance for reproductive success in
   females. We test the hypotheses that (1) female body mass may be more
   tightly constrained than male body mass by ecological variables, and (2)
   female body mass may respond more strongly than male body mass to
   changes in ecological variables (i.e., population-specific female mass
   may vary more across an ecological gradient than male mass).
   Specifically, we investigate the relationship between climatic variables
   and sex-specific body mass in Propithecus, a genus in which
   species-specific body mass has already been demonstrated to covary
   significantly with climatic variables. Data from 733 wild sifakas are
   used to identify sex-specific body mass for 27 populations representing
   all nine described sifaka species, and climatic data for each population
   are derived from the WorldClim database. We use phylogenetic generalized
   least squares models to demonstrate that body mass in both sexes is
   significantly correlated with annual rainfall and number of dry months.
   Furthermore, coefficients of determination are always higher for female
   models, and coefficients for each climatic variable are higher for
   females in all significant models. These results support the two
   hypotheses tested, indicating that ecological forces can have a greater
   impact on female mass than on male mass in primates. Am J Phys Anthropol

Title = {Sex and seasonal differences in diet and nutrient intake in Verreaux's
   sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {79},
Number = {4, SI},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Fluctuations in food availability are a major challenge faced by
   primates living in seasonal climates. Variation in food availability can
   be especially challenging for females, because of the high energetic
   costs of reproduction. Therefore, females must adapt the particular
   demands of the different reproductive stages to the seasonal
   availability of resources. Madagascar has a highly seasonal climate,
   where food availability can be extremely variable. We investigated the
   seasonal changes in diet composition, nutrient and energy intake of
   female and male sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) in a dry deciduous
   forest in western Madagascar. We examined how females adjust their diet
   to different reproductive stages. Seasonality affected the diet of both
   sexes; particularly in the dry season (Apr-Oct) with low availability of
   food items, especially fruits, males and females had a reduced nutrient
   and energy intake compared to the wet season (Nov-Mar) with higher food
   and fruit availability. The comparison of the diet between sexes in
   different reproductive stages showed that during the late stage of
   lactation (Nov-Jan) females had higher food intake, and as a result they
   had a higher intake of macronutrients (crude protein, fat and
   non-structured carbohydrates (TNC)) and energy than males. These
   differences were not present during the pregnancy of females, with both
   sexes having similar intake of macronutrients and energy during that
   stage. The increase in the intake of macronutrients observed for females
   during late lactation could be related to the higher energetic demands
   of this stage of reproduction. Thus, the observed pattern in the diet
   indicates that sifaka females are following a capital breeding strategy,
   whereby females potentially store enough nutrients to cope with the
   reproduction costs in periods of low food availability.},

Title = {Patterns of male dispersal in Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi)
   at Kirindy Mitea National Park},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {79},
Number = {7, SI},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Males of many group-living mammals emigrate from their social groups to
   improve mating opportunities. To help mitigate the social and locational
   costs of dispersal and to increase reproductive benefits, they may
   immigrate seasonally, immigrate alongside a partner, and/or replace the
   alpha male (versus entering a group as a subordinate). Verreaux's sifaka
   (Propithecus verreauxi) are highly seasonally breeding primates
   characterized by male-biased dispersal. We hypothesized that (i) males
   time immigrations to pursue immediate mating opportunities, (ii)
   entrances with partners more often result in alpha male replacement, and
   (iii) male competitive ability affects immigration strategy and alpha
   male tenure length. To assess these proximate aspects of male dispersal,
   we examined 7 years of demographic, morphological, and behavioral data
   for five social groups of Verreaux's sifaka in the Kirindy Mitea
   National Park in western Madagascar. Contrary to expectations and
   studies of sifaka dispersal in other populations, we detected no strong
   seasonal pattern in immigrations. Immigrations occurred individually and
   with partners, and a trend existed for partners to increase the
   likelihood of replacing an alpha male. Pronounced activity of the
   sternal scent gland (a proxy for testosterone and prior dominance
   status), but not body mass, canine size, or potential correlates of
   leaping ability, significantly influenced immigration strategy. The
   absence of a seasonal immigration pattern suggests that fluid group
   boundaries may allow mating success without establishment in a social
   group before the mating season. Our results also suggest that male
   immigration strategies are affected by age, prior dominance status, and
   testosterone levels but not morphological indicators of individual
   competitive ability. Coalitions may be used to improve competitive
   ability. Finally, differences in seasonal immigration patterns and
   length of alpha male vacancies observed at Kirindy Mitea may be due to
   the relatively low population density. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   Records were taken by means of focal animal and instantaneous sampling.
   In both species the mother was the primary carrier and caretaker; the P

   animal other than the mother in the P diadema group. The infant P
   verreauxi spent less time off the mother than did P diadema from week 4
   through week 10. It is concluded that P verreauxi shows more

   postnatal maternal stress associated with elevated glucocorticoid (GC)
   output is known to influence the phenotype of the offspring, including
   their physical and behavioral development. These developmental
   processes, however, remain relatively poorly studied in wild
   vertebrates, including primates with their relatively slow life
   histories. Here, we investigated the effects of maternal stress,
   assessed by fecal glucocorticoid output, on infant development in wild
   Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), a group-living Malagasy
   primate. In a first step, we investigated factors predicting maternal
   fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations, how they impact
   infants' physical and behavioral development during the first 6 months
   of postnatal life as well as early survival during the first 1.5 years
   of postnatal life. We collected fecal samples of mothers for hormone
   assays and behavioral data of 12 infants from two birth cohorts, for
   which we also assessed growth rates. Maternal fGCM concentrations were
   higher during the late prenatal but lower during the postnatal period
   compared to the early/mid prenatal period and were higher during periods
   of low rainfall. Infants of mothers with higher prenatal fGCM
   concentrations exhibited faster growth rates and were more explorative
   in terms of independent foraging and play. Infants of mothers with high
   pre- and postnatal fGCM concentrations were carried less and spent more
   time in nipple contact. Time mothers spent carrying infants predicted
   infant survival: infants that were more carried had lower survival,
   suggesting that they were likely in poorer condition and had to be cared
   for longer. Thus, the physical and behavioral development of these young
   primates were impacted by variation in maternal fGCM concentrations
   during the first 6 months of their lives, presumably as an adaptive
   response to living in a highly seasonal, but unpredictable environment.
   Significance statement
   The early development of infants can be impacted by variation in
   maternal condition. These maternal effects can be mediated by maternal
   stress (glucocorticoid hormones) and are known to have downstream
   consequences for behavior, physiology, survival, and reproductive
   success well into adulthood. However, the direction of the effects of
   maternal physiological GC output on offspring development is highly
   variable, even within the same species. We contribute comparative data
   on maternal stress effects on infant development in a Critically
   Endangered primate from Madagascar. We describe variation in maternal
   glucocorticoid output as a function of ecological and reproductive
   factors and show that patterns of infant growth, behavioral development,
   and early survival are predicted by maternal glucocorticoids. Our study
   demonstrates how mothers can influence offspring fitness in response to
   challenging environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {The Verreaux's sifaka, Propithecus verreauxi, is a medium-sized lemur
   that inhabits in tropical dry lowland and montane forest. Here, we
   reported the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of this species. The
   mitogenome of P. verreauxi is 17 106 bp in length and composed of 13
   protein -coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA
   genes and a control region. The structure about gene order and
   composition is identical to that of the other lemur species and related
   genera. The overall base composition of the heavy strand in descending
   order is A (32.84\%), T (27.13\%), C (26.95\%), and G (13.08\%). Most of
   the genes are encoded on the heavy strand except for the NADH
   dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6) and eight tRNA genes. With the exception
   of COX3, which terminates with an incomplete stop codon (T-), all the
   other PCGs initiates with a traditional ATN start codon and ends with
   the typical mitochondrial stop codon (TAG/TAA/AGA). The phylogenetic
   tree constructed using the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of P.
   verreauxi together with 15 other closely related species with Neighbor
   Joining (NJ) method shows that P. verreauxi is closer to P. coquereli in
   the phylogenetic relationship.},

Abstract = {Female sifaka mate selectively with one or more resident and/or
   non-resident males during the breeding season. Various adaptive
   explanations have been advanced to explain why female primates mate with
   multiple males including that 1) females seek to confuse paternity and
   thereby forestall male infanticide and/or ensure male infant care or 2)
   females seek to ensure fertilization. Assessing the power of
   fertilization insurance to explain mating patterns in females requires
   information on the temporal relationship between mating and ovarian
   hormones. The hormonal correlates of reproduction and mating in
   free-ranging Propithecus verreauxi were investigated using excreted
   steroids as indices of reproductive state. Solid-phase extraction and
   radioimmunoassay techniques were used to measure unconjugated estradiol
   (E(2)) and progesterone (P-4) in 485 desiccated fecal samples collected
   from five female sifaka before and during the breeding season at Beta
   Mahafaly, Madagascar. Results suggest that behavioral estrus was
   characterized by 10- to 15-day elevations in E(2); hormonal activity was
   observed to be similar to pseudo-estrus reported for other lemur
   species; apparent conception was associated with sustained P-4
   elevations beginning 1 to 3 days post-estrus with gestational phase
   elevations of E(2) beginning 42 to 45 days post-conception; and mating
   with multiple partners appeared not to be a prerequisite to
   fertilization, as conception resulted from both monoandrous and
   polyandrous matings. These preliminary data suggest that fertilization
   insurance is not adequate to explain polyandrous mating in sifaka at
   Beta Mahafaly. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {According to optimal foraging theory, herbivores can base food choice
   mainly on the quality or the quantity of food, or both. Among
   herbivorous primates, folivorous lemurs living in the highly seasonal
   environment of Madagascar have to cope with the shortage of high-quality
   food during the dry season, at least in deciduous forests. We studied
   (Verreaux's sifaka) in Kirindy, western Madagascar, to understand the
   influence of dry season and food quality and quantity on behavioral
   patterns and feeding strategy (qualitative vs. quantitative dietary
   choice) of a folivorous lemur in a deciduous forest. We followed 7
   groups (4 groups/period; 3 individuals/group/month) during 4 periods of
   the year (wet season: February-March; early/middle/late dry season:
   May-June; July-September; October-November). We collected samples of
   plants eaten and examined behavioral and feeding patterns, considering
   food quality (macronutrients, proteins/fibers ratio, and tannins) and
   abundance. We found 1) a significant reduction of home range, core area,
   and daily path length from the wet to the dry season, possibly related
   to dietary change and 2) a daily period of inactivity in the dry season
   for energy conservation. Regarding the feeding strategy, Kirindy sifakas
   showed 1) high variation and selection in choosing food items and 2) a
   dietary choice based mainly on quality: Kirindy sifakas fed on plant
   species/families independently from their abundance and tannins
   represented a feeding deterrent during the dry season. Overall,
   behavioral and dietary adaptations allow Kirindy sifakas to overcome the
   shortage of high-quality food in the lean period.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesLittle is known about the absolute pool of energy primates use
   in the wild and how this pool varies seasonally. It is also not fully
   understood why some species facing unpredictable changes in food supply
   and risks of energy imbalance show high breeding seasonality. We
   examined these issues in a folivorous gregarious lemur (Propithecus
   coronatus) in a dry forest of Madagascar.
   MethodsWe assessed energy input and activity budget in males and females
   from three groups during dry and wet months. Diet composition and daily
   food intake were determined using focal animal sampling and continuous
   recording of mouthfuls. Locomotion types and daily distances traveled
   were recorded. Time budget was determined using scan sampling,
   supplemented with a preliminary analysis of the energy budget using the
   factorial method.
   ResultsThe macronutrient composition of the diet did not change markedly
   between seasons but a large increase in energy input arose during the
   early wet season. Activity was highest at this period but entailed only
   moderate increase in energy expenditure. Females did not ingest more
   energy than males despite female dominance. Both sexes exhibited a
   thrifty energy strategy and, possibly, fat storage.
   ConclusionsSeasonal increase of daily energy input was likely related to
   male-male mating competition and females' need to reach physical
   condition prior to the dry season sufficient for reproducing. Sifakas
   may time their reproductive cycle according to the seasonal variation in
   day-length because recurrent patterns of low (dry season) versus high
   (wet season) food production occur despite years of food shortage. Am J

Abstract = {In many mammalian species, the progressive wearing down of the teeth
   that occurs over an individual's lifetime has the potential to change
   dental function, jaw movements, or even feeding habits. The orientation
   of phase-I wear facets on molars reveals the direction of jaw movement
   during the power stroke of mastication. We investigated if and how molar
   wear facets change with increasing wear and/or age by examining a mixed
   longitudinal dataset of mandibular tooth molds from wild Propithecus
   edwardsi (N - 32 individuals, 86 samples). Measurements of the
   verticality of wear facets were obtained from three-dimensional digital
   models generated from mu CT scans. Results show that verticality
   decreases over the lifetime of P. edwardsi, a change that implies an
   increasingly lateral translation of the jaw as the teeth move into
   occlusion. A more transverse phase-I power stroke supports the
   hypothesis that these animals chew to maximize longevity and
   functionality of their teeth, minimizing the ``waste{''} of enamel,
   while maintaining sharp shearing crests. Results of this study indicate
   that wear facet verticality is more closely correlated with age than
   overall amount of tooth wear, measured as area of exposed dentin,
   suggesting that age-related changes in cranial morphology may be more
   responsible for adjustments in jaw motion over the lifetimes of
   Propithecus than wear-related changes in the shape of occluding teeth.
   Finally, the rate of decrease in wear facet verticality with age is
   greater in males than in females suggesting differences in development
   and/or access to resources between the sexes in this species. Am J Phys

Abstract = {The capital and income breeding framework has only recently been used to
   explain variation in female reproductive strategies in primates. The
   application of this framework to primates and other mammals with long
   reproductive cycles has not been consistent. We evaluated data on
   Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) in the Kirindy
   Forest of western Madagascar to determine whether they are capital or
   income breeders. We found that Verreaux's sifaka can be classified as
   either capital or income breeders, depending on how these concepts are
   operationalized. These conflicting findings highlight why the
   capital/income framework is currently problematic and must be
   standardized if it is to be a useful framework for primatologists.},

Title = {Comparative Analysis of the Vocal Repertoires of the Indri (Indri indri)
   and the Diademed Sifaka (Propithecus diadema)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Abstract = {Strepsirrhine vocalisations are extraordinarily diverse and
   cross-species comparisons are needed to explore how this variability
   evolved. We contributed to the investigation of primate acoustic
   diversity by comparing the vocal repertoire of two sympatric lemur
   species, Propithecus diadema and Indri indri. These diurnal species
   belong to the same taxonomic family and have similar activity patterns
   but different social structures. These features make them excellent
   candidates for an investigation of the phylogenetic, environmental, and
   social influence on primate vocal behavior. We recorded 3 P. diadema
   groups in 2014 and 2016. From 1,872 recordings we selected and assigned
   3814 calls to 9 a priori call types, on the basis of their acoustic
   structure. We implemented a reproducible technique performing an
   acoustic feature extraction relying on frequency bins, t-SNE data
   reduction, and a hard-clustering analysis. We first quantified the vocal
   repertoire of P. diadema, finding consistent results for the 9
   putatively identified call types. When comparing this repertoire with a
   previously published repertoire of I. indri, we found highly
   species-specific repertoires, with only 2\% of the calls misclassified
   by species identity. The loud calls of the two species were very
   distinct, while the low-frequency calls were more similar. Our results
   pinpoint the role of phylogenetic history, social and environmental
   features on the evolution of communicative systems and contribute to a
   deeper understanding of the evolutionary roots of primate vocal
   differentiation. We conclude by arguing that standardized and
   reproducible techniques, like the one we employed, allow robust
   comparisons and should be prioritized in the future.},

Abstract = {Vocalizations of Madagascar's lemurs have generally been less
   investigated than those of other primate groups, with virtually no
   information available about calling in the silky sifaka (Propithecus
   candidus), a large rainforest species. Current work examined the
   ``zzuss{''} vocalization, one of the most common and loudest sounds
   produced by this monomorphic species, and included 160 calls from nine
   adults (five males, four females) in three groups. Analyses focused on
   overall acoustic features, individual and sex differences, call usage,
   and likely function. Acoustically, the calls included separable
   turbulent noise and tonal components, with the later often marked by
   frequency jumps and dramatic frequency modulation. Male and female zzuss
   calls differed most in F0- and amplitude-related features,
   characteristics that are relatively unconstrained by overall body size.
   All measures differed among individual callers, with F0-related
   variables again playing the largest role. Based on usage, these calls
   most likely function both as generalized alarm and group-coordination
   signals. The sounds were thus of interest in several regards, including
   showing sexual differentiation in the absence of other dimorphisms,
   exhibiting primarily F0-based differentiation in both sex-and
   individual-based comparisons, and combining apparent alarm and
   coordination functions across a variety of contexts. (C) 2012 Acoustical

Title = {RELATIVE GROWTH OF THE LIMBS AND TRUNK IN SIFAKAS - HETEROCHRONIC,
   ECOLOGICAL, AND FUNCTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {92},
Number = {4},
Pages = {499-520},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Limb, trunk, and body weight measurements were obtained for growth
   series of Milne-Edwards's diademed sifaka, Propithecus diadema edwardsi,
   and the golden-crowned sifaka, Propithecus tattersalli. Similar measures
   were obtained also for primarily adults of two subspecies of the western
   sifaka: Propithecus verreauxi coquereli, Coquerel's sifaka, and
   Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi, Verreaux's sifaka. Ontogenetic series
   for the larger-bodied P. d. edwardsi and the smaller-bodied P.
   tattersalli were compared to evaluate whether species-level differences
   in body proportions result from the differential extension of common
   patterns of relative growth. In bivariate plots, both subspecies of P.
   verreauxi were included to examine whether these taxa also lie along a
   growth trajectory common to all sifakas.
   Analyses of the data indicate that postcranial proportions for sifakas
   are ontogenetically scaled, much as demonstrated previously with cranial
   dimensions for all three species (Ravosa, 1992). As such, P. d. edwardsi
   apparently develops larger overall size primarily by growing at a faster
   rate, but not for a longer duration of time, than P. tattersalli and P.
   verreauxi; this is similar to results based on cranial data. A
   consideration of Malagasy lemur ecology suggests that regional
   differences in forage quality and resource availability have strongly
   influenced the evolutionary development of body-size variation in
   sifakas. On one hand, the rainforest environment of P. d. edwardsi
   imposes greater selective pressures for larger body size than the
   dry-forest environment of P. tattersalli and P. v. coquereli, or the
   semi-arid climate of P. v. verreauxi. On the other hand, as
   progressively smaller-bodied adult sifakas are located in the east,
   west, and northwest, this apparently supports suggestions that adult
   body size is set by dry-season constraints on food quality and
   distribution (i.e., smaller taxa are located in more seasonal habitats
   such as the west and northeast). Moreover, the fact that body-size
   differentiation occurs primarily via differences in growth rate is also
   due apparently to differences in resource seasonality (and juvenile
   mortality risk in turn) between the eastern rainforest and the more
   temperate northeast and west.
   Most scaling coefficients for both arm and leg growth range from slight
   negative allometry to slight positive allometry. Given the low
   intermembral index for sifakas, which is also an adaptation for
   propulsive hindlimb-dominated jumping, this suggests that differences in
   adult limb proportions are largely set prenatally rather than being
   achieved via higher rates of postnatal hindlimb growth. Our analyses
   further indicate that the larger-bodied P. d. edwardsi has a higher
   adult intermembral index than P. tattersalli and P. verreauxi, thus
   supporting the allometric argument regarding the interspecific scaling
   of limb proportions in arboreal primates which employ vertical postures
   (Cartmill, 1974, 1985; Jungers, 1978, 1985).
   Lastly, additional analyses indicate that P. d. edwardsi exhibits
   significant sexual dimorphism where adult females are larger than adult
   males in about one-third of all adult comparisons, whereas P.
   tattersalli exhibits significant sexual dimorphism in about one-fifth of
   all adult comparisons. Among western sifakas, adult P. v. coquereli
   exhibit significant sex dimorphism in about one-third of all
   comparisons, whereas adult P. v. verreauxi show no significant
   differences between the sexes. Given that all taxa are ontogenetically
   scaled, this suggests that sexual dimorphism develops via such processes
   as well. Interestingly, our data indicate that sex dimorphism is
   allometric, with larger-bodied taxa like P. d. edwardsi being more
   dimorphic.},

Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {This study compares locomotor and postural behavior and substrate use of
   three species of lemur, the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema
   edwardsi), the brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus rufus), and the red-bellied
   lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) at two different localities within
   Ranomafana National Park. The object of the study is to see if there are
   quantitative differences in the behavior of the lemurs or their choice
   of substrates in forests that have different structural attributes.
   Analysis of the physical characteristics of the habitat demonstrates
   that compared to the Talatakely area, the Forest at Vatoharanana has a
   higher proportion of larger, taller trees. The behavior of the lemurs
   also differs in the two areas: all species leap less and climb and move
   quadrupedally more at Vatoharanana. All species use small size supports
   less frequently at Vatoharanana, choosing instead medium size supports
   (all three species) or tiny supports (Propithecus and E. fulvus) found
   in tree crowns and terminal branches. The Lemurs prefer (i.e. use more
   often than would be expected based on abundance) large tn:es at both
   sites, At Vatoharanana however, they are more frequently observed higher
   in trees and in taller trees with greater trunk breadth. The differences
   in locomotor behavior are in part due to the fact that at Vatoharanana,
   more bouts are collected during feeding and foraging than during travel.
   The relationship between this difference in activity pattern and the
   structural differences in the two forests, however, is nit clear. This
   study points out the need for longer term field studies of positional
   behavior and substrate use that incorporate the variety of forest types
   the subject species inhabit.},

Abstract = {The interactions between primates and their snake predators are of
   interest because snakes have influenced the evolution of primate visual
   systems and predation has driven the evolution of primate behaviour,
   including group living. However, there are few accounts of primate-snake
   interactions in the wild. We report an incident from Northwest
   Madagascar in which a large female Madagascar ground boa (Acrantophis
   madagascariensis) captured an adult female Coquerel's sifaka
   (Propithecus coquereli); upon capture, the prey's group members
   proceeded to bite and scratch the snake until it released the prey,
   which survived. However, a broken mandible suffered by the boa during
   the incident led to its death by starvation 2 months later. Our
   observations demonstrate that, in addition to improved predator
   detection and deterrence (i.e., mobbing), active defence against some
   predators may provide an additional benefit to group living in
   Coquerel's sifaka, and suggest that predation on group-living primates
   may be more costly for predators than attacking a solitary species of
   similar body size.},

Abstract = {Most primates are able to move with equal facility on the ground and in
   trees, but most use the same quadrupedal gaits in both environments. A
   few specialized primates, however, use a suspensory or leaping mode of
   locomotion when in the trees but a bipedal gait while on the ground.
   This is a rare behavioral pattern among mammals, and the extent to which
   the bipedal gaits of these primates converge and are constrained by the
   anatomical and neurological adaptations associated with arboreal
   locomotion is poorly understood. Sifakas (Propithecus), primates living
   only in Madagascar, are highly committed vertical clingers and leapers
   that also spend a substantial amount of time on the ground. When moving
   terrestrially sifakas use a unique bipedal galloping gait seen in no
   other mammals. Little research has examined the mechanics of these
   gaits, and most of that research has been restricted to controlled
   captive conditions. The energetic costs associated with leaping and
   bipedal galloping are unknown. This study begins to fill that gap using
   triaxial accelerometry to characterize and compare the dynamics of
   sifakas' leaping and bipedal galloping behavior. As this is a relatively
   novel approach, the first goal of this article is to explore the
   feasibility of collecting such data on freeroaming animals and attempt
   to automate the identification of leaping and bipedal behavior within
   the output. The second goal is to compare the overall accelerations of
   the body and to use that as an approximation of aspects of energetic
   costs during leaping and bipedalism. To achieve this, a lightweight
   accelerometer was mounted on freely moving sifakas. The resulting
   acceleration profiles were processed, and sequences of leaps (bouts)
   were automatically extracted from the waveforms with 85\% accuracy. Both
   vector dynamic body acceleration and overall dynamic body acceleration
   (ODBA) were used to characterize locomotor patterns and energy
   expenditure during leaping and bipedalism. The unique kinematics of the
   gait of sifakas, and the mechanics of bouts involving a string of
   successive leaps or gallops, appear to minimize redirections of the
   center of mass as well as the number of acceleration peaks and ODBAs.
   These results suggest that bipedal galloping is not only a reflection of
   the unique anatomical configuration of a leaping primate, but it may
   also provide a musculoskeletal and an energetic advantage to sifakas. In
   that sense, bipedal galloping represents an advantageous way for sifakas
   to move when transitioning from arboreal leaping to terrestrial
   locomotion.},

Title = {Fitness and extra-group reproduction in male Verreaux's sifaka: An

Volume = {132},

Abstract = {Adult males in social groups often compete with other male group members
   for access to adult females. In some primate species, males also seek
   mating opportunities in neighboring social groups. Such extragroup
   fertilizations (EGFs) provide an additional source of variation in male
   fitness. This additional component of fitness provided by EGFs must be
   incorporated into analyses that investigate sources of variation in male
   lifetime reproductive success. In this study, a model is analyzed in
   which male fitness over a 10-year sample period is decomposed into
   additive and multiplicative variance and covariance components. The data
   come from an ongoing study of a wild population of Verreaux's sifaka
   (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) located at Beza Mahafaly Special
   Reserve, Southwest Madagascar. Paternity and demographic data for 134
   males are used to decompose male fitness into the following three
   multiplicative components: reproductive lifespan during sample period,
   fertility, and offspring survival. These multiplicative components are
   estimated for males reproducing within their resident groups plus (i.e.,
   the additive portion) for males reproducing in neighboring social
   groups. The analysis shows that variation in fertility makes the largest
   contribution to variation in total fitness, followed by variation in
   amount of time spent in sample period (which is a proxy of total
   reproductive lifespan) and variation in offspring survival. EGFs
   contribute an important source of variation to male fitness, and
   numerous factors enhance the opportunities for EGFs in male sifaka.
   These include female choice, a high degree of home range overlap, and a
   limited mating season.},

Title = {Bimorphism in male Verreaux's sifaka in the Kirindy Forest of Madagascar},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Male primates in species with pronounced secondary sexual adornments can
   exhibit reversible or irreversible bimorphism, i.e., striking variation
   in the degree to which males express the adornments. Verreaux's sifaka
   (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) use scent marking as a form of
   communication and exhibit sex differences in scent glands. Some males
   exhibit a pronounced brown staining around their sternal gland, whereas
   others do not. We studied morphological and behavioral characteristics
   of males in 6 social groups in Kirindy Forest, Madagascar, from November
   2000 to March 2002 to evaluate the hypotheses that the bimorphism in
   male sifaka chest status represents alternative mating tactics and is a
   badge of status. Males are clearly divided into 2 categories: clean and
   stained chests, with rare, but informative, intermediate males. The
   chest staining probably results from the males scent marking with their
   sternal glands, because stained-chested males scent marked significantly
   more often than clean-chested males. Though sample sizes are small,
   chest status did not appear to depend on body size. Chest status is
   reversible and related to dominance rank. In each group, only I male,
   the dominant, was stained-chested, whereas all other (subordinate) males
   were clean-chested. These findings suggest that stained chests are
   visual and olfactory signals of dominance rank and that clean chests
   signal lack of competitive intent. Thus, this bimorphism may reflect
   alternative mating tactics used by males to maximize their reproductive
   success based upon their social environment.},

Title = {Functional and Evolutionary Significance of the Recruitment and Firing
   Patterns of the Jaw Adductors During Chewing in Verreaux's sifaka

Year = {2011},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Jaw-muscle electromyographic (EMG) patterns indicate that compared with
   thick-tailed galagos and ring-tailed lemurs, anthropoids recruit more
   relative EMG from their balancing-side deep masseter, and that this
   muscle peaks late in the power stroke. These recruitment and firing
   patterns in anthropoids are thought to cause the mandibular symphysis to
   wishbone (lateral transverse bending), resulting in relatively high
   symphyseal stresses. We test the hypothesis that living strepsirrhines
   with robust, partially fused symphyses have muscle recruitment and
   firing patterns more similar to anthropoids, unlike those strepsirrhines
   with highly mobile unfused symphyses. Electromyographic (EMG) activity
   of the superficial and deep masseter, anterior and posterior temporalis,
   and medial pterygoid muscles were recorded in four dentally adult
   Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi). As predicted, we find that
   sifaka motor patterns are more similar to anthropoids. For example,
   among sifakas, recruitment levels of the balancing-side (b-s) deep
   masseter are high, and the b-s deep masseter fires late during the power
   stroke. As adult sifakas often exhibit nearly complete symphyseal
   fusion, these data support the hypothesis that the evolution of
   symphyseal fusion in primates is functionally linked to wishboning.
   Furthermore, these data provide compelling evidence for the convergent
   evolution of the wishboning motor patterns in anthropoids and sifakas.

Title = {Birth season testosterone levels in male Verreaux's sifaka, Propithecus
   verreauxi: insights into socio-demographic factors mediating seasonal
   testicular function},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {49},

Pages = {117-127},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Previous research suggests that although reproduction and testicular
   function in wild sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) are highly seasonal,
   birth season elevations in fecal testosterone (T) in transferring males
   indicate that social factors may be as important as climatic factors in
   regulating reproductive function in sifraka. This paper examines the
   relationship of male dispersal and social status to the patterning of
   birth season aggression and testicular function in P. verreauxi at Beta
   Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar. Behavioral and hormonal data were
   collected from a total of 38 adult males, 15 residing in seven stable
   groups and 23 living in eight unstable groups, yielding 186 fecal
   samples and 493 focal animal hours of observation. The results suggest
   that birth season elevations in fecal testosterone are the consequence
   of social disruption resulting from male movements between groups and
   the particular responses of individual males to dispersal events.
   Hormonal responses to dispersal events appear to precede behavioral
   responses and occasionally register reactions not concomitantly evident
   in the behavioral response, and may be predictive of future events.
   Hormonal reactions occurred primarily in resident alpha males,
   suggesting that they differ in their assessment of destabilizing
   influences, perhaps due to different reproductive opportunities and/or
   investment. These findings are important for the new insights they
   provide into the role of androgens in mediating male dispersal, life
   history, and reproductive strategies, and suggest that investigations of
   androgen-behavior interactions in free-ranging populations can be a
   powerful new tool for assessing the contextual and motivational basis of
   social behavior.},

   fragments?},

Volume = {40},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The mechanisms through which forest fragmentation threatens the survival
   of mammal populations remain poorly known, yet knowledge of this process
   would greatly aid conservation efforts. I investigated ranging behaviors
   of diademed sifakas (Propithecus diadema) in continuous and fragmented
   forest at Tsinjoarivo, eastern Madagascar, using focal animal
   observations to examine home range size, daily path length (DPL), and
   habitat use relative to forest edges over 12 mo. Sifaka groups in forest
   fragments had home ranges that were 25-50 percent as large as continuous
   forest groups, and moderately reduced DPLs. Continuous forest groups
   foraged more than expected near forest edges while fragment groups
   avoided edges. Fragments have higher population density than continuous
   forest; however, several lines of evidence suggest that fragment groups'
   food resources may be denser, but lower quality. Continuous forest
   groups appear to be energy-maximizers, maintaining large ranges and
   preferentially feeding in rare fruiting trees found only in continuous
   forest interiors, while fragment groups appear to be time-minimizers,
   using small home ranges and primarily feeding on mistletoe (a fallback
   food in continuous forest). Therefore, the consequences of fragmentation
   on long-term viability remain unknown; it is possible that the advantage
   of increased density is outweighed by longer-term demographic
   challenges, or other threats (e.g., nutrition, health, social behavior,
   disease). When animals stranded in forest fragments exhibit complex and
   potentially unpredictable responses, simple ecological proxies (e.g.,
   incidence patterns and density) are probably inadequate in assessing
   population health and viability. Ecological study and monitoring is
   essential in judging the viability of fragmented populations.},

Title = {Exploring Social Dominance in Wild Diademed Sifakas (Propithecus
   diadema): Females Are Dominant, but It Is Subtle and the Benefits Are
   Not Clear},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},

Pages = {385-398},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Rarely observed in mammals, female dominance is documented in several of
   Madagascar's lemurs. Although dominance affects many aspects of
   primates' lives, studies have largely focused on dyadic agonistic
   interactions to characterise relationships. We explored the power
   structure of three diademed sifaka groups (Propithecus diadema) at
   Tsinjoarivo during the lean season (July-August, 325 h) using social
   behaviours, group leadership, displacements and feeding outcomes. Two
   groups had a hierarchy dominated by the breeding female, while the
   highest rank was held by the breeding male in the third; in dyadic
   interactions, breeding females dominated males in all groups.
   Inconsistencies in hierarchies suggest that groups vary, with rank
   related to kinship ties of breeders. Aggression and grooming were rare;
   adult females received aggression at lower frequencies than males. Group
   movements were led more by females and followed more by males, and
   female feeding priority was evident in displacements during feeding.
   However, males and females did not differ in feeding outcomes, as
   expected (particularly in the lean season) if female dominance (and/or
   male deference) serves to ensure better access for females. This
   unexpected pattern (female dominance despite rare aggression, clear
   female leadership and displacement, yet no observable benefit in
   grooming or feeding outcomes) defies easy explanation, and reinforces
   the fact that studies examining female power in lemurs should take a
   multifaceted approach. Further study is needed to understand this
   pattern, the physiological and reproductive consequences of female
   dominance (e.g. detecting subtler variation in food quality or intake
   rates) and exactly how (and when) the benefits of female dominance are
   manifested.},

Abstract = {Feeding strategy and social dominance in female sifakas (Propithecus v.
   verreauxi) living in a Didiereaceae forest in southern Madagascar. We
   addressed the issue of female social dominance as an adaptive response
   to seasonal energy stress in white sifakas living in a fragment of
   Didiereaceae forest of southern Madagascar. We tested whether female and
   male sifakas would exhibit different activity budgets, food choices and
   energy input given harsh ecological constraints that prevail in such
   xerophytic ecosystems. Behavioural data were obtained on 2 groups
   (including 8 focal individuals) during a 2-month study in the late wet
   season. We analysed forest composition, based on a sample of more than
   1000 trees, shrubs and lianas, and phenology through a regular survey of
   479 tagged individuals. Males and females were mostly feeding on mature
   leaves of common plant species, to which they added a range of minor
   food items. The activity budgets (5-min scan interval) did not differ
   significantly between sexes. In contrast, marked differences of food
   intake (using a quantitative method) were observed: we evaluated that
   females consumed daily 30-40\% more food than males while the ranking of
   preferred foods remained globally similar between sexes. Ad libitum
   records confirmed female dominance over males in a feeding context,
   although few aggressive events were recorded. We conclude that (1) time
   sampling methods may not be appropriate to assess food intake because
   ingestion rates likely vary among individuals and (2) high food intake
   of adult females relative to males during the early gestation period is
   uncoupled with immediate physiological needs and may reflect a
   sex-specific fattening strategy allowing females to increase their
   reproductive success.},

Title = {Increase in tannin consumption by sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi
   verreauxi) females during the birth season: a case for self-medication
   in prosimians?},
Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {44},

Pages = {61-66},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this study we report preliminary data on the consumption of
   tannin-rich plants by sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) living
   in the Kirindy forest, western Madagascar. Sifakas spent most of their
   time feeding on only a few plant species. The tannin intake during the
   period between the pregnancy and birth season was significantly higher
   in pregnant females or females with lactating infants than in
   non-reproductive females and males. These periparturient females secured
   a larger proportion of condensed tannins by short feeding bouts on
   plants not included in the group's limited preferred food species. The
   measured increase in tannin intake is puzzling in light of the fact that
   tannins are commonly known for their protein-binding properties. Since
   protein demands are highest in pregnant and lactating females, possible
   medicinal benefits of tannin ingestion are considered. Tannin
   consumption is associated with an increase in body weight and
   stimulation of milk secretion. Veterinarians administer tannins as an
   astringent, anti-hemorrhagic and anti-abortive. Their high potential as
   an alternative anthelminthic has also recently been recognized. Thus,
   when viewed as self-medicating behavior, controlled increase in tannin
   intake could have multiple prophylactic advantages for females during
   the periparturient period. The high selectivity in their plant choice,
   and the presence of unusual feeding habits by a particular group of
   individuals (females with infants) limited in time (birth season),
   suggests that an increase in tannin ingestion may be a self-medicating
   behavior with multiple directly adaptive benefits to female
   reproduction.},

Title = {Local habitat, not phylogenetic relatedness, predicts gut microbiota
   better within folivorous than frugivorous lemur lineages},

Abstract = {Both host phylogenetic placement and feeding strategy influence the
   structure of the gut microbiome (GMB); however, parsing their relative
   contributions presents a challenge. To meet this challenge, we compared
   GMB structure in two genera of lemurs characterized by different dietary
   specializations, the frugivorous brown lemurs (Eulemur spp.) and the
   folivorous sifakas (Propithecus spp.). These genera sympatrically occupy
   similar habitats (dry forests and rainforests) and diverged over similar
   evolutionary timescales. We collected fresh faeces from 12 species (six
   per host genus), at seven sites across Madagascar, and sequenced the 16S
   rRNA gene to determine GMB membership, diversity and variability. The
   lemurs' GMBs clustered predominantly by host genus; nevertheless, within
   genera, host relatedness did not predict GMB distance between species.
   The GMBs of brown lemurs had greater evenness and diversity, but were
   more homogeneous across species, whereas the GMBs of sifakas were
   differentiated between habitats. Thus, over relatively shallow
   timescales, environmental factors can override the influence of host
   phylogenetic placement on GMB phylogenetic composition. Moreover,
   feeding strategy can underlie the relative strength of host-microbiome
   coadaptation, with Madagascar's folivores perhaps requiring locally
   adapted GMBs to facilitate their highly specialized diets.},

Title = {Sex differences in scent-marking in Sifaka: Mating conflict or male
   services?},

Abstract = {Male and female interests can either be in conflict or serve as a basis
   for exchange. Communication is thus an important aspect of intersexual
   relationships. Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi uerreauxi), like
   many prosimians, uses chemical signals as one form of communication. The
   goals of this study were to determine 1) if males and females exhibit
   sex differences in their scent-marking behavior, and 2) if scent-marking
   is an example of mating conflict or cooperation. All occurrences of
   scent-marks, scent-mark context, and scent-mark style were collected on
   23 sifaka in the Kirindy Forest of western Madagascar for 7 months
   (September 2001-March 2002). Scent-mark rates were collected using
   continuous focal animal sampling from November 2000-March 2002.
   Homerange data were collected using monthly censuses and instantaneous
   focal sampling throughout those 17 months. The pressures of behavioral
   ecology seem to have shaped scent-marking in sifaka: the sexes exhibited
   significantly different scent-marking behavior. Results from this study
   are consistent with the hypotheses that 1) females scent-mark to
   advertise their presence and mark their resources, 2) clean-chested
   males use scent-marks as between-group communication to advertise their
   presence, and 3) stained-chested males use scent-marks as a form of
   olfactory mate-guarding. Scent-marking does not appear to be a
   ``service{''} that males provide to females, because overmarking limits
   female communication rather than adding to the overall number of
   scentmarks. Scent-marking behavior is a crucial aspect of the mating
   conflict and for understanding intersexual relationships in sifaka.},

Title = {Living in forest fragments reduces group cohesion in diademed sifakas

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {69},
Number = {4},
Pages = {434-447},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Forest fragmentation is thought to threaten primate populations, yet the
   mechanisms by which this occurs remain largely unknown. However,
   fragmentation is known to cause dietary shifts in several primate
   species, and links between food resource distribution and within-group
   spatial dynamics are well documented. Thus, fragmentation has the
   potential to indirectly affect spatial dynamics, and these changes may
   present additional stresses to fragmented populations. I present the
   results from a 12-month study of Propithecus diadema at Tsinjoarivo,
   eastern Madagascar, including two groups in fragments and two in
   continuous forest. Instantaneous data on activity and spatial position
   were collected during all-day focal animal follows. Fragment groups had
   much lower cohesion, being more likely to have no neighbor within 5 and
   10 m. For continuous forest groups, cohesion was highest in the rainy
   season (when food patches are large) and lowest in winter (when the
   animals rely on small-crowned mistletoes), and the chance of having no
   neighbor within 5 m was positively correlated with mistletoe
   consumption. Thus the decreased cohesion in fragment groups is inferred
   to result from their increased reliance on mistletoes and other small
   resources, which causes them to spread out among multiple patches. This
   scenario is consistent with the reduced body mass of subordinate
   individuals (males and immatures) in fragments, and suggests the
   occurrence of steeper within-group fitness gradients. Further research
   is necessary to determine whether these patterns apply to other
   primates; however, since fragmentation tends to cause the loss of the
   largest trees, many primates in fragments may lose their largest food
   resources and undergo similar behavioral shifts.},

Title = {Infant Transport and Mother-Infant Contact From 1 to 26 Weeks Postnatal

Year = {2016},
Volume = {78},

Abstract = {Lactating females face energetic constraints absent in conspecifics and
   must compensate for higher energy requirements. Infant transport is the
   most energetically costly mammalian activity after lactation.
   Nonetheless, infant transport and mother-infant contact are seldom
   measured. The extreme seasonality characteristic of Madagascar coupled
   with lactation costs and infant transport is a trifold energetic
   challenge encountered by lemur mothers. We hypothesized that Coquerel's
   sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) mothers spend more time caring for
   infants during the early/earlier-mid lactation period, coinciding with
   the resource depletive austral winter, relative to later-mid/late
   lactation. We tested this hypothesis by measuring infant carrier
   identity, transport position, and frequency of mother-infant contact for
   678 focal hours over two consecutive birth seasons from 1 to 26 weeks
   postnatal (N = 10 infants, N = 10 mothers, N = 19 adult males, N = 8
   adult females) in Ankarafantsika National Park (ANP), Madagascar.
   Quantifying P. coquereli postnatal care strategies demonstrates how a
   species with a ``slow{''} life history lives in an energetically
   challenging environment, thereby providing data on maternal energetic
   responses and infant development in an endangered strepsirrhine. Mothers
   were the primary infant transporters. Adult males and non-lactating
   females participated in infant transport, but for significantly less
   time. Infants spent significantly more time in the ventral transport
   position than dorsally or independently. Infants were still transported
   26\% of the time at 6.5 months postnatal. Infants initiated and broke
   bodily contact with mothers more frequently than mothers initiated and
   broke contact with infants. Infants were dependent on their mothers for
   longer durations than suggested by previous studies and carried dorsally
   until later ages than in other comparably sized wild lemurs. Am. J.

Abstract = {As undisturbed habitat becomes increasingly rare, managers charged with
   ensuring the survival of endangered primate species must increasingly
   utilize disturbed and degraded habitats in species survival plans. Yet
   we have an imperfect understanding of the true long-term viability of
   primate populations in disturbed habitat, and census data can be
   misleading because density is not necessarily correlated with habitat
   quality and population viability in predictable ways. Here we present
   clinical laboratory data on hematology, serum biochemistry, fat-soluble
   vitamins, minerals, iron analytes, viral serology, and parasitology of
   diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema), derived from the capture of 26
   individuals spanning eight groups and two habitats (undisturbed vs.
   disturbed and fragmented) at Tsinjoarivo, Madagascar. Blood from
   fragment individuals had significantly lower values for several factors:
   white blood cell counts, bilirubin, total protein, albumin, calcium,
   sodium, chloride, manganese, zinc, iron and total iron-binding capacity.
   Several biochemical variables were higher in immature individuals,
   probably due to active growth. The large number of interhabitat
   differences suggests that habitat disturbance has an impact on
   physiological health within this population, perhaps reflecting dietary
   stress and/or immunosuppression. These results, combined with previous
   data showing altered diet, slower juvenile growth, and reduced activity
   in disturbed forest fragments, suggest that fragment sifakas may be less
   healthy than continuous forest groups. Finally, Tsinjoarivo sifakas have
   extremely low blood urea nitrogen (perhaps reflecting protein
   limitation) and selenium levels relative to other lemurs. Despite their
   survival and reproduction in the short term in fragments, these sifakas
   may represent a riskier conservation investment than conspecifics in
   undisturbed forest, and may be more susceptible to environmental
   stressors. However, more data on the fitness consequences of these
   biochemical differences are needed for a better interpretation of their
   impacts on long-term viability prospects. Am. J. Primatol. 72:1013-1025,

Abstract = {Not only can teeth provide clues about diet, but they also can be
   indicators of habitat quality. Conspecific groups living in different
   habitats with different kinds of foods may exhibit different rates of
   dental attrition because their teeth are less well adapted to some foods
   than to others. Ecological disequilibrium describes the situation in
   which animals live in habitats to which they are relatively poorly
   adapted. We test whether dental senescence, the wear-related decrease in
   dental functionality that is associated with decreased survival of
   infants born to older Propithecus edwardsi females, can be explained by
   ecological disequilibrium. Specifically, we compare the rates of dental
   wear in sifaka groups living in nearby habitats that differ in the
   degree of anthropogenically induced disturbance. We hypothesize that
   sifakas living in disturbed areas have an unusual rate of tooth wear
   compared to those living in a more pristine area, and that dental
   senescence is a consequence of an atypically high wear rate in a
   degraded habitat. To test whether habitat quality affects tooth wear
   more generally, we compare rates of use-wear in two subsets of
   Microcebus rufus living in either relatively undisturbed or disturbed
   habitats. Contrary to our predictions, we did not detect different rates
   of tooth wear in disturbed versus undisturbed habitats for either
   species and consider that reproductively detrimental dental senescence
   in P. edwardsi females is unlikely to be a pathological consequence of
   ecological disequilibrium. Am J Phys Anthropol 148:228237, 2012. (c)

Title = {Environmental and anthropogenic influences on movement and foraging in a
   critically endangered lemur species, Propithecus tattersalli:
   implications for habitat conservation planning},
Journal = {MOVEMENT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Background Wildlife conservation often focuses on establishing protected
   areas. However, these conservation zones are frequently established
   without adequate knowledge of the movement patterns of the species they
   are designed to protect. Understanding movement and foraging patterns of
   species in dynamic and diverse habitats can allow managers to develop
   more effective conservation plans. Threatened lemurs in Madagascar are
   an example where management plans and protected areas are typically
   created to encompass large, extant forests rather than consider the
   overall resource needs of the target species. Methods To gain an
   understanding of golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli)
   movement patterns, including space use and habitat selection across
   their range of inhabited forest types, we combined behavior data with
   Dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models and Resource Selection
   Functions. We also examined the influence of abiotic, biotic, and
   anthropogenic factors on home range size, movement rates, and foraging
   patterns. Results We found that home range size and movement rates
   differed between seasons, with increased core area size and movement in
   the rainy season. Forest type also played a role in foraging behavior
   with sifaka groups in the humid forest avoiding roads in both seasons,
   groups in the dry deciduous forest avoiding road networks in the rainy
   season, and groups in the moderate evergreen forest displaying no
   selection or avoidance of road networks while foraging. Conclusion Our
   study illustrates the importance of studying primate groups across
   seasons and forest types, as developing conservation plans from a single
   snapshot can give an inaccurate assessment of their natural behavior and
   resources needs of the species. More specifically, by understanding how
   forest type influences golden-crowned sifaka movement and foraging
   behavior, conservation management plans can be made to the individual
   forest types inhabited (dry deciduous, moderate evergreen, humid,
   littoral, etc.), rather than the region as a whole.},

Abstract = {Primates often live in human-altered habitats; Malagasy lemurs are no
   exception. It is important to understand if habitat alteration affects
   primates' space use patterns across multiple spatial and temporal
   scales, as this drives population density. We quantified the daily,
   seasonal, and annual space-use of seven groups of Milne-Edwards' sifaka
   (Propithecus edwardsi) living in unlogged and logged rain forest in
   Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar between December 2002 and November
   2003. Concurrent data showed that sifakas consumed higher quality foods
   in the unlogged than in logged forests; thus we explored how space use
   patterns were related to energy use strategies. Sifaka groups in the
   logged rain forest traveled 7-13\% less per day than groups in the
   unlogged rain forest, despite their larger home ranges (median: 46.12
   and 23.52 ha, in the logged and unlogged forests, respectively). Sifakas
   may thus use an energy-minimizing strategy at the scale of the
   individual day but an energy-maximizing strategy at the annual home
   range scale. Sifakas exhibited fidelity to the home range across
   seasons, but their core area of use shifted considerably with season. We
   found no difference in population density between sites. However, given
   the interannual variability in sifaka foods, a multiyear study is needed
   to assess if energy strategies observed in this study are consistent
   across longer time periods. Our findings suggest that lemurs may persist
   in logged habitats by altering spatial use patterns; future work should
   attempt to quantify the threshold level of forest regeneration from
   logging that will allow lemurs to persist at similar densities as in
   unlogged forest.},

Journal = {ZOO BIOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {20},

Pages = {447-461},
Abstract = {The nutrient content and intake of locally available North Carolina
   browse was evaluated for use as a supplement to a herbivorous primate
   diet of commercial biscuit and produce. Twice weekly from May to October
   1997, total dietary intakes were determined for two groups of folivorous
   lemurs. Group I consisted of Propithecus diadema diadema (n = 1) and R
   tattersalli (n = 1) and group II consisted of P. verreauxi coquereli (n
   = 3). Six pooled samples of the diet and weekly samples of three browse
   species, Rhus copallina, Albizia julibrissin, and Liquidamber
   styrachiflua were analyzed for dry matter, energy, fiber, and nitrogen
   content. Browse species were also analyzed for nonprotein nitrogen and
   acid-insoluble nitrogen. Group average dry matter intakes were 37.1 +/-
   2.2\% (mean +/- SEM) and 49.7 +/- 3.0\% of amount offered for groups I
   and H, respectively. Browse contributed 40.7 +/- 2.9\% and 29.6 +/-
   2.4\% of the total daily intake for groups I and H, respectively. Browse
   species differed (P < 0.05) for dry matter, energy, neutral detergent
   fiber, acid detergent fiber, cellulose, lignin, total nitrogen,
   nonprotein nitrogen, available nitrogen, and available protein. R.
   copallina and L. styrachiflua were similar in total nitrogen, available
   nitrogen, and nonprotein nitrogen; A. julibrissin was higher. L.
   styrachiflita was highest in lignin. Dry matter, acid detergent fiber,
   and lignin in browse samples increased seasonally (P < 0.05), whereas
   available protein decreased (P < 0.01). Animals were offered and
   consumed R. copallina most often, followed by A. julibrisson and L.
   styrachiflua. With the exception of R. copallina, animals generally
   consumed oily the immature leaves, flowers, or seeds of species offered.
   Daily dry matter intake varied because of both browse offered and
   consumed and biscuit and produce diet consumed. Thus, increased fiber
   density can be a major benefit of browse use only when incorporated into
   the total diet with respect to species use, quantity of other diet
   ingredients offered, and targeted nutrient intakes. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {Theoretical advances in the study of social evolution have highlighted
   the importance of studying group formation in conjunction with
   population dynamics. To address this need, a number of demographically
   explicit models have been developed. We parameterize such a model to
   study the evolution of multimale associations in Verreaux's sifaka
   (Propithecus verreauxi), a diurnal lemur living in small
   multimale-multifemale groups. We use long-term demographic data from a
   population in western Madagascar to estimate the fitness prospects of
   different male behavioral strategies. Our results indicate that
   dispersing male sifaka, rather than searching for a breeding territory
   of their own (floating), do better joining an established group as a
   subordinate with limited reproductive opportunities, mainly because they
   may later ascend to the dominant position. By contrast, resident males
   should not accept potential immigrants because we could not find any
   measurable benefit of living in a multimale group for them. There is
   thus a conflict over group membership between resident and floater
   males, and we suggest that floaters at least occasionally win this
   conflict because they have more to gain from joining than residents
   stand to lose by sharing their territory.},

Abstract = {Sexually selected traits and the use of strategies to enhance male
   reproductive success (e.g., competition and dispersal) can yield sex
   differences in metabolic requirements, rates and durations of growth and
   maturation, and the propensity for risky behavior, which are suggested
   to result in age-specific sex differences in mortality and life span. We
   investigated age-specific sex ratios, mortality, and dispersal in
   Propithecus edwardsi in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. We
   predicted that, due to similarities in growth rates and body sizes, male
   and female juvenile mortality rates would be comparable; because both
   sexes disperse and have intense intersexual competition and aggression,
   adult mortality would be similar; given similarities in dispersal
   frequency and distance, the timing of dispersal would not differ. We
   used 80 group-years births, deaths, and dispersals (N-females 41,
   N-males 34) collected over 23 years to calculate sex ratios and survival
   curves. Females lived longer than males (maximum 32 and 19 years,
   respectively). Sex ratios were male biased from sexual maturity through
   17 years and female biased at birth and older ages. Infant survival
   probabilities were similar. Thus, differential development and
   maturation are unlikely explanations for longer female life span in this
   species. Males were more likely to survive from 2 to 18 years. However,
   male annual survival probability declined quickly around 1318 years;
   males continued to disperse until their deaths, whereas females
   generally stopped dispersing after 11 years. We suggest that sex
   differences in the timing of dispersal and the unique challenges of
   risky behavior at older ages may be sufficient to yield differences in
   male and female life span.},

Abstract = {Optimal group size and composition are determined by both the costs and
   benefits of group living for the group's members. Verreaux's sifakas
   (Propithecus verreauxi), a diurnal lemur, form multimale multifemale
   groups with the tendency toward even adult sex ratios despite a small
   average number of females per group. The unexpected presence of multiple
   adult males may be explained by tolerance of other group members if
   subordinate males provide benefits to the group that outweigh the costs
   associated with their presence. Results based on both demographic data
   collected over a 13-year period and behavioral observations suggest that
   Subordinate males provide no benefits in terms of infant survival and
   defense against group takeover by outside males. Although groups with
   more males are more likely to win intergroup encounters, subordinate
   males do not participate in these encounters more often than expected
   Subordinate males are not costly to other group members in terms of
   direct intragroup feeding competition, but aggression rates between
   dominant and immigrated subordinate males increase in the mating season.
   Even though subordinate males provide very few benefits to the group,
   they are not very costly either and thus may be tolerated by resident
   females and dominant males This tolerance may help to partially explain
   the tendency towards their unusual adult sex ratio. Am J Phys Anthropol

Title = {One size fits all? Relationships among group size, health, and ecology
   indicate a lack of an optimal group size in a wild lemur population},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {73},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Group size is a key component of sociality and can affect individual
   health and fitness. However, proximate links explaining this
   relationship remain poorly understood, partly because previous studies
   neglected potential confounding effects of ecological factors. Here, we
   correlated group size with various measures of health while controlling
   for measures of seasonality and habitat quality, to explore trade-offs
   related to group living in a mainly folivorous primate-Verreaux's
   sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi). Over a course of 2 years, we studied 42
   individuals of 7 differently sized groups (range 2-10) and combined
   measures of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (n > 2300 samples),
   parasitism (n > 500 samples), ranging and activity patterns, together
   with estimates of habitat quality (measures of similar to 7000 feeding
   trees). None of our measures was correlated with group size, while
   seasonality, but not habitat quality, impacted almost all examined
   variables. We conclude that group size alone might be insufficient to
   explain patterns in the sociality-health nexus or that the small range
   of group sizes in this species does not induce effects suggested for
   species living in larger groups. An optimal group size balancing the
   advantages and disadvantages of living in differently sized groups may
   not exist for Verreaux's sifakas. Our results do not support predictions
   of the ecological constraints hypothesis or the optimal group size
   hypothesis as they may only account for species limited in group size by
   ecological factors-a condition that may not apply to the majority of
   folivorous mammals, which seem to be limited by social factors.},

Title = {Interannual Variation in Diet, Dietary Diversity, and Dietary Overlap in
   Three Sympatric Strepsirrhine Species in Southeastern Madagascar},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Dietary data are used to categorize species diets, but these
   categorizations do not take into account the mutability of food
   resources in time or space, the level of interspecific competition in
   various communities as these resources change, nor the dietary
   flexibility of species. In this study, we assess the diets of three
   sympatric species, Eulemur rufifrons, Propithecus edwardsi, and Varecia
   variegata, in the Vatoharanana site in Ranomafana National Park,
   Madagascar. We determine dietary diversity, overlap, and interannual
   variation with data collected from 2001 to 2003. We then compare results
   on food preference and time feeding with data collected on each species
   in the late 1980s and early 1990s to determine whether these findings
   are consistent over the long term. We found little interannual variation
   in the proportion of time spent eating particular plant parts for each
   of the lemur species during the three study years (2001-2003), and
   between the earlier and current study. Food items were not always
   consumed based solely on availability. Dietary diversity was lower in
   the two frugivorous species (V. variegata and E. rufifrons) compared
   with the folivorous species (P. edwardsi), and V. variegata and E.
   rufifrons were more likely to focus their feeding time on one particular
   genus and plant part in each year. The study species used different
   strategies to deal with food, particularly fruit, shortages such as a
   plastic social structure (V. variegata), habitat shifting (E.
   rufifrons), and dietary switching (P. edwardsi). Although there was low
   dietary overlap between the study species, they depended on a small
   number of shared fruits in each of the study years (Chrysophyllum,
   Syzygium, Ocotea, Plagioscyphus), which may indicate some potential for
   interspecific competition. Because these lemur species, like all
   primates, lead relatively long lives (avg. > 30 years) and have slow
   rates of aging, longitudinal studies are needed to test hypotheses
   reliant on basic dietary information.},

Title = {Patterns of Quadrupedal Locomotion in a Vertical Clinging and Leaping
   Primate (Propithecus coquereli) with Implications for Understanding the
   Functional Demands of Primate Quadrupedal Locomotion},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {160},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {644-652},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives: Many primates exhibit a suite of characteristics that
   distinguish their quadrupedal gaits from non-primate mammals including
   the use of a diagonal sequence gait, a relatively protracted humerus at
   touchdown, and relatively high peak vertical forces on the hindlimbs
   compared to the forelimbs. These characteristics are thought to have
   evolved together in early, small-bodied primates possibly in response to
   the mechanical demands of navigating and foraging in a complex arboreal
   environment. It remains unclear, however, whether primates that employ
   quad-rupedalism only rarely demonstrate the common primate pattern of
   quadrupedalism or instead use the common non-primate pattern or an
   entirely different mechanical pattern from either group.
   Materials and Methods: This study compared the kinematics and kinetics
   of two habitually quadrupedal primates (Lemur catta and Varecia
   variegata) to those of a dedicated vertical clinger and leaper
   (Propithecus coquereli) during bouts of quadrupedal walking.
   Results: All three species employed diagonal sequence gaits almost
   exclusively, displayed similar degrees of humeral protraction, and
   exhibited lower vertical peak forces in the forelimbs compared to the
   hindlimb.
   Discussion: From the data in this study, it is possible to reject the
   idea that P. coquereli uses a non-primate pattern of quadrupedal walking
   mechanics. Nor do they use an entirely different mechanical pattern from
   either most primates or most non-primates during quadrupedal locomotion.
   These findings provide support for the idea that this suite of
   characteristics is adaptive for the challenges of arboreal locomotion in
   primates and that these features of primate locomotion may be basal to
   the order or evolved independently in multiple lineages including
   indriids. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Folivorous primate biomass has been shown to positively correlate with
   the average protein-to-fiber ratio in mature leaves of tropical forests.
   However, studies have failed to explain the mismatch between dietary
   selection and the role of the protein-to-fiber ratio on primate biomass;
   why do not folivores always favor mature leaves or leaves with the
   highest protein-to-fiber ratio? We examined the effect of leaf chemical
   characteristics and plant abundance (using transect censuses; 0.37ha,
   233 trees) on food choices and nutrient/toxin consumption in a
   folivorous lemur (Propithecus verreauxi) in a gallery forest in southern
   Madagascar. To assess the nutritional quality of the habitat, we
   calculated an abundance-weighted chemical index for each chemical
   variable. Food intake was quantified using a continuous count of
   mouthfuls during individual full-day follows across three seasons. We
   found a significant positive correlation between food ranking in the
   diet and plant abundance. The protein-to-fiber ratio and most other
   chemical variables tested had no statistical effect on dietary
   selection. Numerous chemical characteristics of the sifaka's diet were
   essentially by-products of generalist feeding and low energy input/low
   energy crop strategy. The examination of feeding behavior and plant
   chemistry in Old World colobines and folivorous prosimians in Madagascar
   suggests that relative lack of feeding selectivity and high primate
   biomass occur when the average protein-to-fiber ratio of mature leaves
   in the habitat exceeds a threshold at 0.4. Am. J. Primatol. 76:563-575,

Title = {Human-Lemur Coexistence in a Multiple-Use Landscape},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {Human impacts on the natural world are increasing and are generally
   considered a threat to wildlife conservation and the persistence of
   species. However, not all human activities are antithetical to
   conservation and not all taxa are impacted in the same ways.
   Understanding how wildlife respond to human activities at the population
   and individual level will help inform management of landscapes where
   humans and wildlife can coexist. We examined the effects of
   anthropogenic activities on a critically endangered primate, Verreaux's
   sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), at a multiple-use reserve in southwest
   Madagascar. Specifically, we sought to determine which activities the
   sifakas perceived as disturbances, using the framework of the risk
   disturbance hypothesis (RDH). The RDH holds that animals will respond to
   perceived disturbances as they do to predation threats. We therefore
   predicted that sifakas would be more vigilant, spend more time in high
   forest strata, reduce their daily feeding time, and occur at lower
   densities in response to high levels of perceived disturbance. Using
   data on sifaka behavior and spatial distribution, and the frequencies of
   anthropogenic activities, we found that sifakas increased vigilance and
   their height above the ground in response to certain human-related
   activities, notably those of domestic dogs. Contrary to our predictions,
   however, we did not find a negative effect of anthropogenic activities
   on daily activity budgets or population density. The relationship
   between the occurrence of sifakas and the intensity of tree cutting was
   actually positive. Our results indicate that sifakas perceive certain
   anthropogenic activities as threats and respond with immediate
   behavioral shifts, but that these activities do not have a discernible
   negative impact on the reserve's population at this time. These results
   suggest that lemur conservation can be successful even in areas that are
   subject to moderate human use.},

Abstract = {A recent genetic investigation found some species of prosimian to have

   flicker photometry reveal a cone photopigment polymorphism paralleling
   an opsin gene polymorphism detected by molecular methods. This species
   has two middle-to-long-wavelength cone pigments with peak sensitivities
   of about 545 and 558 nm and a short-wavelength-sensitive cone with a
   peak at about 430 nm. The distribution of these pigments among animals
   predicts the presence of both dichromatic and trichromatic forms of

Title = {Lemurs in a Complex Landscape: Mapping Species Density in Subtropical
   Dry Forests of Southwestern Madagascar Using Data at Multiple Levels},

Abstract = {The study of southern dry forest lemurs has been largely restricted to
   small reserves; yet, the majority of the region's lemur populations
   reside outside protected areas. Lemur catta and Propithecus verreauxi
   occupy the same forests but have different dietary preferences. This
   study assessed L. catta and P. verreauxi population densities across a
   3-km dry forest gradient (1,539 ha) in southern Madagascar. The study
   was designed to allow lemur densities to be related to particular forest
   types. A particular aim of this study was to collect lemur data in both
   protected and unprotected areas. Density estimates were calculated using
   point transect distance sampling in a study area that contained the Beza
   Mahafaly Special Reserve and the adjacent disturbed forests. The highest
   densities recorded for each species were in the protected area where the
   two species were most segregated in their distribution, with L. catta
   density highest in gallery forest type and P. verreauxi density highest
   in dry deciduous. Densities of both species varied widely outside the
   protected area, but P. verreauxi density was more uniform than was L.
   catta. Results of this study indicate that patterns of lemur density in
   protected areas are not representative of patterns in disturbed forests;
   this also suggests that we cannot fully understand the ecological
   constraints facing primate species by studying them only in protected
   areas. This research highlights the value of pairing the study of
   landscape-level patterns of species distribution with both local
   ground-level ecological interpretations and broad-scale satellite data;
   information from only one level may give an incomplete view of the
   community. Am. J. Primatol. 73:38-52, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {The Collective Action Problem but Not Numerical Superiority Explains
   Success in Intergroup Encounters in Verreaux's Sifaka (Propithecus
   verreauxi): Implications for Individual Participation and Free-Riding},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Socioecological theory predicts that larger groups are able to gain
   better access to resources because of their numerical advantage in
   intergroup contests. Nevertheless, the numerical superiority hypothesis
   has received mixed support, perhaps due to the collective action problem
   and sex differences in strategies and payoffs. We tested the numerical
   superiority and the collective action problem hypotheses using 141
   intergroup encounters in a 7-year dataset on 5 groups of Verreaux's
   sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) at Ankoatsifaka Research Station in
   Kirindy Mitea National Park in western Madagascar. Contrary to the
   numerical superiority hypothesis, larger groups were not more likely to
   supplant smaller groups, nor was success determined by participation of
   a larger number of one sex. Consistent with a collective action problem,
   group size negatively affected participation. Notably, the sexes
   differed in which factors predicted individual participation. Male
   participation, which may serve to defend mating opportunities with
   resident females and signal competitive ability to neighboring groups,
   was greater than female participation, though we did not detect any
   strong predictor of male participation. Female participation was more
   likely during the lactation season, when food resources were scarce,
   than during the mating season. Contrary to previous studies, which
   argued that mothers with infants avoid intergroup conflicts because of
   the risk of infanticide, our study suggests that maternal energetic
   stress due to lactation and food scarcity increases the benefits of
   defending resources and instead drives mothers to participate in
   intergroup encounters. Thus, individual reproductive payoffs provide the
   private incentives needed to induce collective action.},

Abstract = {Geophagy has been observed in nearly every long-term study of folivorous
   primates. Yet despite frequent observations of this behavior, conclusive
   explanations for soil consumption remain ambiguous. This study tests the
   most frequently proposed hypotheses for geophagy using data collected on
   the geophagic behavior of the Milne-Edwards' sifaka (Propithecus
   edwardsi) living in two forests with varying levels of disturbance
   within Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. Field data were collected
   from December 2002 to November 2003, during which time soil samples were
   collected for mineral analyses from 102 sites selected for geophagy and
   42 control sites at which no geophagy was recorded. Results indicate
   that control soils differ significantly between the two study sites and
   that this difference is primarily attributable to varying levels of
   habitat disturbance. The frequency of soil consumption also does not
   vary significantly by sex or between logged and unlogged habitats. Soil
   consumption significantly correlated with fruit/seed consumption
   overall, but to a lesser degree in logged compared with unlogged sites.
   Clay minerals found in soils likely prevent absorption of dietary toxins
   in the gut and/or may mediate gut pH. This provides strong evidence for
   the protection hypothesis for geophagy, which may be especially
   important in areas where logging, or other forms of habitat disturbance,
   has been experienced. in French is available with online material.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Many species fall into specific mating-system categories, and that
   category is usually associated with a suite of behavioral and
   morphological characteristics. Several lemur species, including
   Propithecus diadema edwardsi, have been labeled `idiosyncratic' because
   variation in socionomic sex ratios among groups is consistent with wide
   variation in social structure. We used several hypotheses founded in
   behavioral ecology to assess variability in P.d. edwardsi. First we
   examined 46 group-mating seasons to quantify variability. We then tested
   predictions that the number of males per group would increase as the
   number of adult females increased, and the number of males would
   increase as female mating synchrony increased. Examining variation in
   offspring survival relative to the number of adult males in a group may
   tell us which composition is likely to persist into the future, so we
   also hypothesized that as the number of males in a group increased,
   fertility and offspring survival would increase. We found an equal
   distribution of polygynous, polygynandrous, pairs, and polyandrous
   groups. Furthermore, female distribution and mating synchrony did not
   predict the number of males, and offspring survival was not correlated
   with the number of males. Since infants survived equally well in groups
   of all compositions, sifakas experienced no pressure to maintain a
   particular number of adult males per adult female. The small number of
   adults per group (mean=3.2) may result from balancing feeding
   competition against predator detection. Augmenting the mate pool
   available from the group with mates from neighboring groups may promote
   the notable variability seen in the adult group compositions of sifakas.},

Abstract = {The Perrier's sifaka Propithecus perrieri, considered critically
   endangered by the IUCN (World Conservation Union; 2004), is one of the
   least studied and most endangered primates in the world, yet baseline
   information on its distribution and population levels has not been
   updated for over 10 years. Density estimates from former studies suggest
   that only between 100 and 2000 individuals remain in the wild. In
   2003-2004, using the line-transect method, information on the
   distribution and population levels of this and sympatric primate species
   were obtained. Multi-spectral, Landsat 7 satellite images of areas
   comprising the known Perrier's sifaka distribution, acquired in 1994 and
   2002, were compared using spatial analysis techniques to quantify
   regional patterns of deforestation. Results from this study indicate
   that the global population of the Perrier's sifaka consists of about 915
   individuals and the effective population size is unlikely to exceed 230
   individuals. Furthermore, an annual deforestation rate of 1.2\% was
   detected in the only protected area where this species occurs.
   Deforestation, the decline of taboos against hunting and human
   immigration patterns influence primate population status in northern
   Madagascar and threaten to drive the Perrier's sifaka to extinction in
   the near future.},

Abstract = {The gut microbiome is gaining recognition for its role in primate
   nutrition, but we stand to benefit from microbiome comparisons across
   diverse hosts and environmental conditions. We compared gut microbiome
   structure in four lemur species from four phylogenetic lineages,
   including 9 individual mouse lemurs (Microcebus danfossi), 6 brown
   lemurs (Eulemur fulvus), 20 sifakas (Propithecus coquereli), and a
   single sportive lemur (Lepilemur grewcockorum). In northwestern
   Madagascar, these species are sympatric, but use different feeding
   strategies to cope with environmental challenges, including relying on
   tree gums and insects (mouse lemurs), and some vs. significant leaf
   matter (brown lemurs vs. sifakas and sportive lemurs). From one fecal
   sample collected per lemur in the dry season in the Anjajavy Forest, we
   determined gut microbiome diversity, variability, and membership via 16S
   rRNA sequencing. The lemurs harbored strongly species-specific gut
   microbiomes. Brown lemurs showed more diverse and generalized consortia;
   mouse lemurs, sifakas, and the sportive lemur had less diverse consortia
   with more distinct memberships. Consistent with their fallback foods,
   mouse lemur microbiomes included taxa putatively associated with gum and
   insect digestion, whereas those of sifakas and the sportive lemur showed
   stronger and distinct signatures of leaf fiber and secondary compound
   metabolism. These results point to feeding strategy, intertwined with
   host phylogeny, as a driver of gut microbiome composition, but highlight
   real-time dietary specificity as a contributing driver of microbiome
   diversity. While illuminating how gut microbiomes facilitate host
   nutrition on challenging foods, these results help explain how
   ecologically diverse primates living in sympatry may differentially cope
   with seasonal or stochastic lean times.},

Title = {Use of total dietary fiber across four lemur species (Propithecus
   verreauxi coquereli, Hapalemur griseus griseus, Varecia variegata, and
   Eulemur fulvus): Does fiber type affect digestive efficiency?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In vivo digestibility and transit of two experimental diets were
   compared across four lemur species for which gastrointestinal morphology
   and preliminary data on physiology differ: Varecia variegate (VV),
   Eulemur fulvus (EF), Propithecus verreauxi (PV), and Hapalemur griseus
   (HG). Since free-ranging groups consume varied amounts of slowly
   fermentable insoluble fiber (IF) and rapidly fermentable soluble fiber
   (SF), differences in digestibility may be related to variation in the
   fiber types consumed. To investigate this, two diets were designed to
   provide 28\% of dry matter (DM) as total dietary fiber (TDF). The ratio
   of IF/SF (g/g) differed across the diets (12.15:1 for the IF diet, and
   3.76:1 for the IF/SF diet). The DM digestibility (DMD) of both diets
   differed across species: DMD was lower for EF and VV (approximately
   56-58\%), and higher for PV (72\%) and HG (76\%). The fiber
   digestibility results were as follows: TDF digestibility was similar for
   VV and EF (23\% and 28\%), higher for PV (56\%), and highest for HG
   (66\%). IF digestibility was lower for VV and EF (20\% and 28\%), and
   higher for PV and HG (53\% and 62\%). The transit times (TTs) of the two
   markers Cr and Co were similar (approximately 3.5 hr for VV and EF, 25
   hr for PV, and 30 hr for HG). The mean retention times (MRTs) showed the
   same trend. The results from these captive groups suggest there are
   large differences in digestive efficiency that are likely related to the
   varied fiber composition of the free-ranging diet, and the amount of
   time the digesta are retained in the gut. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Drivers of gut microbiome variation within and between groups of a wild
   Malagasy primate},
Journal = {MICROBIOME},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {Background: Various aspects of sociality can benefit individuals'
   health. The host social environment and its relative contributions to
   the host-microbiome relationship have emerged as key topics in microbial
   research. Yet, understanding the mechanisms that lead to structural
   variation in the social microbiome, the collective microbial
   metacommunity of an animal's social network, remains difficult since
   multiple processes operate simultaneously within and among animal social
   networks. Here, we examined the potential drivers of the convergence of
   the gut microbiome on multiple scales among and within seven
   neighbouring groups of wild Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) -
   a folivorous primate of Madagascar.
   Results: Over four field seasons, we collected 519 faecal samples of 41
   animals and determined gut communities via 16S and 18S rRNA gene
   amplicon analyses. First, we examined whether group members share more
   similar gut microbiota and if diet, home range overlap, or habitat
   similarity drive between-group variation in gut communities, accounting
   for seasonality. Next, we examined within-group variation in gut
   microbiota by examining the potential effects of social contact rates,
   male rank, and maternal relatedness. To explore the host intrinsic
   effects on the gut community structure, we investigated age, sex, faecal
   glucocorticoid metabolites, and female reproductive state. We found that
   group members share more similar gut microbiota and differ in alpha
   diversity, while none of the environmental predictors explained the
   patterns of between-group variation. Maternal relatedness played an
   important role in within-group microbial homogeneity and may also
   explain why adult group members shared the least similar gut microbiota.
   Also, dominant males differed in their bacterial composition from their
   group mates, which might be driven by rank-related differences in
   physiology and scent-marking behaviours. Links to sex, female
   reproductive state, or faecal glucocorticoid metabolites were not
   detected.
   Conclusions: Environmental factors define the general set-up of
   population-specific gut microbiota, but intrinsic and social factors
   have a stronger impact on gut microbiome variation in this primate
   species.},

Title = {Molecular Adaptation to Folivory and the Conservation Implications for
   Madagascar's Lemurs},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {The lemurs of Madagascar include numerous species characterized by
   folivory across several families. Many extant lemuriform folivores exist
   in sympatry in Madagascar's remaining forests. These species avoid
   feeding competition by adopting different dietary strategies within
   folivory, reflected in behavioral, morphological, and microbiota
   diversity across species. These conditions make lemurs an ideal study
   system for understanding adaptation to leaf-eating. Most folivorous
   lemurs are also highly endangered. The significance of folivory for
   conservation outlook is complex. Though generalist folivores may be
   relatively well equipped to survive habitat disturbance, specialist
   folivores occupying narrow dietary niches may be less resilient.
   Characterizing the genetic bases of adaptation to folivory across
   species and lineages can provide insights into their differential
   physiology and potential to resist habitat change. We recently reported
   accelerated genetic change in RNASE1, a gene encoding an enzyme (RNase
   1) involved in molecular adaptation in mammalian folivores, including
   various monkeys and sifakas (genus Propithecus; family Indriidae). Here,
   we sought to assess whether other lemurs, including phylogenetically and
   ecologically diverse folivores, might show parallel adaptive change in
   RNASE1 that could underlie a capacity for efficient folivory. We
   characterized RNASE1 in 21 lemur species representing all five families
   and members of the three extant folivorous lineages: (1) bamboo lemurs
   (family Lemuridae), (2) sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), and (3)
   indriids (family Indriidae). We found pervasive sequence change in
   RNASE1 across all indriids, a d(N)/d(S) value > 3 in this clade, and
   evidence for shared change in isoelectric point, indicating altered
   enzymatic function. Sportive and bamboo lemurs, in contrast, showed more
   modest sequence change. The greater change in indriids may reflect a
   shared strategy emphasizing complex gut morphology and microbiota to
   facilitate folivory. This case study illustrates how genetic analysis
   may reveal differences in functional traits that could influence
   species' ecology and, in turn, their resilience to habitat change.
   Moreover, our results support the body of work demonstrating that not
   all primate folivores are built the same and reiterate the need to avoid
   generalizations about dietary guild in considering conservation outlook,
   particularly in lemurs where such diversity in folivory has probably led
   to extensive specialization via niche partitioning.},

Title = {Chest staining variation as a signal of testosterone levels in male
   Verreaux's Sifaka},

Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Male Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) exhibit variation in the
   staining of chest hair in association with the activity of the sternal
   gland. Scent-marking behavior and social relationships have been shown
   to vary with the state of chest staining. Research on other mammals
   suggests that sternal gland activity is modulated by testosterone. The
   goal of this study was to examine the relationship among fecal
   testosterone, testes mass, and chest staining in sifaka. I predicted
   that for sifaka (1) testosterone and testes mass are positively
   correlated, (2) stained males have higher testosterone and larger testes
   than clean-chested males, (3) testes mass is greater during the mating
   season than the birth season, and (4) testes mass is comparable to
   species with multimale mating systems. Eighty fecal samples were
   collected from eight adult males in five social groups in the Kirindy
   Mitea National Park of Madagascar during the mating season and analyzed
   using enzyme immunoassays. Males were captured during the mating season
   and the subsequent birth season to measure body mass and testes size and
   to document chest staining. Stained males had significantly higher IT
   and larger testes mass than clean-chested males. Testes mass was
   significantly greater during the mating season than the birth season for
   all males. However, the stained males exhibited less testes mass
   reduction during birth season than clean-chested males. These results
   suggest that the activity of the sternal gland is regulated by
   testosterone and that sexual selection has shaped male morphological
   variation in Verreaux's sifaka. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Evaluating effects of deforestation, hunting, and El Nino events on a
   threatened lemur},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {141},
Number = {1},
Pages = {287-297},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Madagascar ranks as one of the world's top extinction hotspots because
   of its high endemism and high rate of habitat degradation. Global
   climate phenomena such as El Nino Southern Oscillations may have
   confounding impacts on the island's threatened biota but these effects
   are less well known. We performed a demographic study of Propithecus
   edwardsi, a lemur inhabiting the eastern rainforest of Madagascar, to
   evaluate the impact of deforestation, hunting, and El Nino on its
   population and to re-evaluate present endangerment categorization under
   the IUCN. Over 18 years of demographic data, including survival and
   fecundity rates were used to parameterize a stochastic population model
   structured with three stage classes (yearlings, juveniles, and adults).
   Results demonstrate that hunting and deforestation are the most
   significant threats to the population. Analysis of several plausible
   scenarios and combinations of threat revealed that a 50\% population
   decline within three generations was very likely, supporting current
   IUCN classification. However, the analysis also suggested that changing
   global cycles may pose further threat. The average fecundity of lemurs
   was over 65\% lower during El Nino years. While not as severe as
   deforestation or hunting, if El Nino events remain at the current high
   frequency there may be negative consequences for the population. We
   suggest that it is most critical for this species continued survival to
   create more protected areas, not only to thwart hunting and
   deforestation, but also to give this endangered lemur a better chance to
   recover from and adapt to altered climate cycles in the future. (C) 2007

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Most studies that examine the influence of climatic change on flora and
   fauna have focused on northern latitudes; however, there is increasing
   recognition that tropical regions are also being affected. Despite this,
   regions such as Madagascar, which are rich in endemic biodiversity but
   may have low adaptive capacity to climatic change, are poorly
   represented in studies examining the effects of climate variability on
   biota. We investigated how El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO)
   influence precipitation patterns in the rainforest region of
   southeastern Madagascar (1962-2006) and then constructed models to
   assess the potential contribution of climatic variables on the
   reproductive parameters of the Milne Edward's sifaka, a threatened lemur
   species (Propithecus edwardsi), over a 20-year period. The Southern
   Oscillation Index of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the
   tropical Pacific was associated with precipitation patterns including
   wetter wet seasons during warmer phases and drier dry seasons following
   cooler phases. The best-supported models of lemur fecundity (female
   offspring per female that survive to 1 year of age per year) included
   cyclone presence during gestation and ENSO phase before conception and
   during the first 6 months of life. Models also suggested that heavy
   rains during gestation may limit birth rates and that prolonged drought
   during female lactation may limit first year offspring survival;
   although these variables were given little importance for predicting
   overall fecundity relative to ENSO phases and cyclone presence. Our
   results linking lemur reproduction with climatic variability suggest
   that climatic changes may be an additional threat to Madagascar's unique
   and already endangered flora and fauna. The association between
   precipitation in southeastern Madagascar and SST anomalies in the
   tropical Pacific suggests that dynamics of wildlife populations even in
   tropical areas such as Madagascar can be affected by global climate
   cycles making them potentially vulnerable to global climate change.},

Abstract = {In this study we compared the scent-marking rates of females with those
   of males. Specifically, we examined the ability of season, dominance
   status, and natal status to explain the frequency of scent marking in
   female sifakas living wild in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, and
   compared the results with those published for males {[}Pochron et al.,
   American Journal of Primatology, in press]. We also sought to determine
   whether vulnerability to infanticide affects marking frequency in adults
   of either sex, and whether female reproductive status affects female
   marking behavior. We found that males marked at twice the rate of
   females, and like males, females in single-female groups marked at the
   highest rates. Dominant females and non-natal females marked at higher
   rates than did subordinate females and natal females, a pattern also
   seen in males. This suggests that scent marks may convey important
   information about status. Neither females nor males varied their marking
   frequency with the presence of vulnerable infants. Females did not alter
   marking frequency with reproductive state, and like males, they marked
   at higher rates in the period prior to the mating season than they did
   in the mating season itself. This implies that females may use scent
   marks more for intrasexual aggression or territoriality than for mate
   attraction. Am. J. Primatol. 66:97-110, 2005. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Most anatomical studies of primates focus on skeletal tissues, but
   muscular anatomy can provide valuable information about phylogeny,
   functional specializations, and evolution. Herein, we present the first
   detailed description of the head, neck, pectoral, and upper limb muscles
   of the fetal lemuriforms Lemur catta (Lemuridae) and Propithecus
   coquereli (Indriidae). These two species belong to the suborder
   Strepsirrhini, which is often presumed to possess some plesiomorphic
   anatomical features within primates. We compare the muscular anatomy of
   the fetuses with that of infants and adults and discuss the evolutionary
   and developmental implications. The fetal anatomy reflects a
   phylogenetically more plesiomorphic condition in nine of the muscles we
   studied and a more derived condition in only two, supporting a parallel
   between ontogeny and phylogeny. The derived exceptions concern muscles
   with additional insertions in the fetus which are lost in adults of the
   same species, that is, flexor carpi radialis inserts on metacarpal III
   and levator claviculae inserts on the clavicle. Interestingly, these two
   muscles are involved in movements of the pectoral girdle and upper limb,
   which are mainly important for activities in later stages of life, such
   as locomotion and prey capture, rather than activities in fetal life.
   Accordingly, our findings suggest that some exceptions to the ``ontogeny
   parallels phylogeny{''} rule are probably driven more by ontogenetic
   constraints than by adaptive plasticity. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {49},
Number = {6},
Pages = {722-742},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We report here definitive evidence of butchery, most probably associated
   with hunting, of giant extinct lemurs by early human settlers in
   Madagascar. Specimens of Palaeopropithecus ingens and Pachylemur
   insignis from two sites in southwestern Madagascar, Taolambiby and
   Tsirave, show classic signs of butchering. We compared these to the
   bones (also from Taolambiby) of butchered Propithecus verreauxi, a lemur
   still living in the region. The characteristics of the tool-induced
   extinct-lemur bone alterations (sharp cuts and chop marks near joints,
   oblique cuts along the shafts, spiral fractures, and percussion striae)
   suggest skinning, disarticulation, and filleting. Conclusive evidence of
   megafaunal modification by humans in Madagascar was limited previously
   to a few hippo and elephant bird bones and one extinct aye-aye tooth.
   New evidence comes not from archaeological sites, but from specimens
   collected in the early 1900s, without stratigraphic records, at
   ``subfossil{''} sites (i.e., sites renowned for their late Pleistocene
   or Holocene fossils, often lacking human artifacts). Whereas these are
   hardly the most ideal samples for analysis of this kind, careful
   scrutiny of the characteristics of the cut marks has allowed us to
   document butchery beyond any reasonable doubt. One bone with definitive
   cut marks has been dated to the very earliest part of the human period
   in Madagascar. Continued, careful research on the bones in subfossil
   collections is warranted. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Noninvasive Molecular Sexing: An Evaluation and Validation of the SRY-

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},

Abstract = {Many lemur species are arboreal, elusive, and/or nocturnal and are
   consequently difficult to approach, observe and catch. In addition, most
   of them are endangered. For these reasons, non-invasive sampling is
   especially useful in primates including lemurs. A key issue in
   conservation and ecological studies is to identify the sex of the
   sampled individuals to investigate sex-biased dispersal, parentage,
   social organization and population sex ratio. Several molecular tests of
   sex are available in apes and monkeys, but only a handful of them work
   in the lemuriform clade. Among these tests, the coamplification of the
   SRY gene with the amelogenin X gene using strepsirhine-specific X
   primers seems particularly promising, but the reliability and validity
   of this sexing test have not been properly assessed yet. In this study,
   we (i) show that this molecular sexing test works on three additional
   lemur species (Microcebus tavaratra, Propithecus coronatus and P.
   verreauxi) from two previously untested genera and one previously
   untested family, suggesting that these markers are likely to be
   universal among lemurs and other strepsirrhines; (ii) provide the first
   evidence that this PCR-based sexing test works on degraded DNA obtained
   from noninvasive samples; (iii) validate the approach using a large
   number of known-sex individuals and a multiple-tubes approach, and show
   that mismatches between the field sex and the final molecular consensus
   sex occur in less than 10\% of all the samples and that most of these
   mismatches were likely linked to incorrect sex determinations in the
   field rather than genotyping errors. Am J Phys Anthropol 150:492-503,

Abstract = {From mid-August to late October 1988, we surveyed Marojejy Strict Nature
   Reserve, in the northern part of Madagascar's rain forest. Although
   widely believed to be a keystone site for lemur conservation, only
   incidental information concerning Marojejy's primate communities has
   hitherto been published. The reserve extends from 75 to 2133 m in
   altitude, and its 60,150 ha comprise an almost-intact series of
   altitudinal forest zones, now fundamentally isolated from formerly
   contiguous surrounding forest. We visited all forest zones and all
   altitudes of the reserve. We observed a total of nine species including
   the little-known diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema candidus), for
   which Marojejy is the most important site. Aye-aye (Daubentonia
   madagascarensis) is also present. Brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus albifrons)
   is the most frequently observed species. Little is known about this
   subspecies in the wild. In the interior many lemurs were extremely
   inquisitive of human presence, showing how little hunted they are. This
   contrasted with their lower numbers and evasive behavior in the more
   accessible regions of the reserve. The major threats to the lemurs of
   Marojejy are the ceaseless piecemeal clearance of the reserve's forest,
   which is proceeding inward from the boundary, and direct trapping.},

Abstract = {Dispersal is a critical issue for understanding various aspects of
   animal biology and for conserving endangered species. We investigated
   the conditions that determine dispersal in four groups of sifakas
   inhabiting Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. Following this
   population for 22 years, we collected and analyzed data on birth,
   relatedness, immigration, dispersal and death of 77 sifakas. We
   predicted that dispersal would function to prevent inbreeding and occur
   seasonally to aid establishment in a group before the breeding season.
   We further predicted that immigrants would evict same-sex residents and
   immigrant males would commit infanticide to shorten interbirth
   intervals. Although most dispersal theories predict male-biased
   dispersal in mammals, both male and female sifakas dispersed at equal
   rates from their natal and breeding groups. Behaviourally and
   genetically, there was no evidence for inbreeding within this
   population; individuals never produced offspring with close relatives.
   Dispersal matched the strong seasonal pattern of reproduction.
   Immigration events were always associated with the disappearance of the
   group infant(s). As a result of infanticide by male immigrants, mothers
   came into estrus sooner; infanticide by female immigrants caused mothers
   to disperse from their groups. This study reveals a clear pattern of
   dispersal that is condition, not sex, dependent.},

Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing platforms are generating massive amounts of
   genomic data from nonmodel species, and these data sets are valuable
   resources that can be mined to advance a number of research areas. An
   example is the growing amount of transcriptome data that allow for
   examination of gene expression in nonmodel species. Here, we show how
   publicly available transcriptome data from nonmodel primates can be used
   to design novel research focused on immunogenomics. We mined
   transcriptome data from the world's most endangered group of primates,
   the lemurs of Madagascar, for sequences corresponding to
   immunoglobulins. Our results confirmed homology between strepsirrhine
   and haplorrhine primate immunoglobulins and allowed for high-throughput
   sequencing of expressed antibodies (Ig-seq) in Coquerel's sifaka
   (Propithecus coquereli). Using both Pacific Biosciences RS and Ion
   Torrent PGM sequencing, we performed Ig-seq on two individuals of
   Coquerel's sifaka. We generated over 150000 sequences of expressed
   antibodies, allowing for molecular characterization of the
   antigen-binding region. Our analyses suggest that similar VDJ expression
   patterns exist across all primates, with sequences closely related to
   the human V(H)3 immunoglobulin family being heavily represented in
   sifaka antibodies. Moreover, the antigen-binding region of sifaka
   antibodies exhibited similar amino acid variation with respect to
   haplorrhine primates. Our study represents the first attempt to
   characterize sequence diversity of the expressed antibody repertoire in
   a species of lemur. We anticipate that methods similar to ours will
   provide the framework for investigating the adaptive immune response in
   wild populations of other nonmodel organisms and can be used to advance
   the burgeoning field of eco-immunology.},

Title = {Dynamic vs. static social networks in models of parasite transmission:
   predicting Cryptosporidium spread in wild lemurs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {86},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Social networks provide an established tool to implement heterogeneous
   contact structures in epidemiological models. Dynamic temporal changes
   in contact structure and ranging behaviour of wildlife may impact
   disease dynamics. A consensus has yet to emerge, however, concerning the
   conditions in which network dynamics impact model outcomes, as compared
   to static approximations that average contact rates over longer time
   periods. Furthermore, as many pathogens can be transmitted both
   environmentally and via close contact, it is important to investigate
   the relative influence of both transmission routes in real-world
   populations. Here, we use empirically derived networks from a population
   of wild primates, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), and
   simulated networks to investigate pathogen spread in dynamic vs. static
   social networks. First, we constructed a
   susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model of Cryptosporidium spread
   in wild Verreaux's sifakas. We incorporated social and environmental
   transmission routes and parameterized the model for two different
   climatic seasons. Second, we used simulated networks and greater
   variation in epidemiological parameters to investigate the conditions in
   which dynamic networks produce larger outbreak sizes than static
   networks. We found that average outbreak size of Cryptosporidium
   infections in sifakas was larger when the disease was introduced in the
   dry season than in the wet season, driven by an increase in home range
   overlap towards the end of the dry season. Regardless of season, dynamic
   networks always produced larger average outbreak sizes than static
   networks. Larger outbreaks in dynamic models based on simulated networks
   occurred especially when the probability of transmission and recovery
   were low. Variation in tie strength in the dynamic networks also had a
   major impact on outbreak size, while network modularity had a weaker
   influence than epidemiological parameters that determine transmission
   and recovery. Our study adds to emerging evidence that dynamic networks
   can change predictions of disease dynamics, especially if the disease
   shows low transmissibility and a long infectious period, and when
   environmental conditions lead to enhanced between-group contact after an
   infectious agent has been introduced.},

Abstract = {The degree to which historical human activities negatively impacted past
   and present lemur species is a long-standing question in primatology. At
   present, most evidence addressing this issue comes from archaeology,
   paleontology, and behavioral studies. Genetic data provide another
   source of evidence. In this study, six microsatellite loci, genotyped on
   more than 360 wild Verreaux's sifaka, are used in order to test the
   hypothesis that this population experienced a population bottleneck in
   the last 2000 years. Excess heterozygosity is compared with the
   heterozygosity expected under mutation-drift equilibrium in order to
   test for the genetic signature of a rapid population contraction in the
   past. The results indicate that the sifaka population did not experience
   a population bottleneck. Various methodological and conceptual
   implications of this result are discussed.},

Title = {Semantic differences in sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) alarm calls: A

Journal = {ETHOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {112},
Number = {9},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this study, we compared the usage of alarm calls and anti-predator
   strategies between a captive and a wild lemur population. The wild lemur
   population was studied earlier in Western Madagascar (Fichtel \&
   Kappeler 2002). The captive population was studied in outdoor enclosures
   of the Duke University Primate Center. Alarm calls and anti-predator
   behavior were elicited by conducting experiments with both vocal and
   visual dummies. We scored the subjects' immediate behavioral responses,
   including alarm calls, from video recordings made during the
   experiments. In principle, both populations have a mixed alarm call
   system with functionally referential alarm calls for aerial predators
   and general alarm calls for terrestrial and aerial predators and for
   situations associated with high arousal, such as group encounters.
   Although wild and captive sifakas exhibit the same alarm call system and
   use the same alarm call types, we discovered striking differences in the
   usage and perception of some of the alarm calls. We argue that these

Title = {Seed handling by three prosimian primates in Southeastern Madagascar:
   Implications for seed dispersal},

Abstract = {In this paper, we studied three species of prosimian primate
   (Propithecus diadema edwardsi, Eulemur fulvus rufus, and Eulemur
   rubriventer) from June-July 1995 at the Ranomafana National Park to
   answer three questions: 1) how they handle and process seeds, 2) how the
   physical properties of seeds influence seed handling and seed fate, and
   3) whether handling and processing patterns influence seed dispersal.
   Seeds from five plant species were collected from feces and examined for
   external damage (punctures and scrapes), weighed, measured, and checked
   daily for germination. P. d. edwardsi masticated seeds into two or more
   pieces while feeding. Seed fragments were either dropped under the
   parent tree or chewed and swallowed; seeds never emerged as recognizable
   units in feces. In contrast, both Eulemur species either dropped or
   swallowed seeds whole while feeding. E. rubriventer passed seeds that
   were longer, wider, and heavier than seeds passed by E. f. rufus.
   Although seeds emerged as separate units when passed by both Eulemur
   species, 65 Protorhus sp. seeds were scraped and/or punctured prior to
   being swallowed. Based on physical property tests, Protorhus seeds were
   more susceptible to mastication than undamaged seeds from Eugenia sp.,
   Cissus sp., and Chrysophyllum madagascariensis. H. madagascariensis
   seeds also were undamaged but had physical properties comparable to
   Protorhus and may avoid being masticated due to their small size (2-3
   mm). All damaged seeds were moldy or rotten within 6 days, and only 15\%
   of the undamaged seeds passed by E. rubriventer germinated. None of the
   seeds passed by E. f. rufus germinated. Eulemur species also rested in
   the same tree after feeding and defecated prior to a new feeding bout or
   before moving, so seeds were most likely to be dispersed under the
   parent tree. Consequently, we concluded that these primate species do
   not appear to serve as effective seed dispersers for these plant species
   at this time of year. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The production of vocalizations in nonhuman primates is predominantly
   innate, whereas learning influences the usage and comprehension of
   vocalizations. In this study, I examined the development of alarm call
   recognition in free-ranging infant Verreaux's sifakas. Specifically, I
   investigated their ability to recognize conspecific alarm calls as well
   as those of sympatric redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus) in
   Kirindy forest, western Madagascar. Both species have functionally
   referential alarm calls for aerial. predators and give general alarm
   calls for both aerial and general predators and also other kinds of
   threats, such as intergroup encounters with conspecifics. I conducted
   playback experiments with members of two birth cohorts (nine and ten
   individuals) to determine the age at which infant Verreaux's sifakas
   discriminate between conspecific alarm calls, heterospecific alarm
   calls, and non-alarm vocalizations (parrot song). Most 3-4 months old
   infants fled toward adults after hearing any playback stimuli, whereas
   4-5-month-old infants did so only after presentation of alarm calls.
   Moreover, all infants of these age classes showed a longer latency to
   flee after the parrot song indicating their emerging ability to
   discriminate between alarm calls and non-alarm stimuli. At an age of
   about 6 months, infants switched from fleeing toward adults to
   performing adult-like escape responses after presentation of conspecific
   and heterospecific alarm calls. Thus, the ability to discriminate
   between alarm from non-alarm stimuli precedes the appearance of
   adult-like responses. The transition to adult-like escape behavior was
   coincident with the physical independence of infants from their mothers.},

Title = {Hair phenotype diversity across Indriidae lemurs},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Abstract = {Objectives Hair (i.e., pelage/fur) is a salient feature of primate
   (including human) diversity and evolution-serving functions tied to
   thermoregulation, protection, camouflage, and signaling-but wild primate
   pelage evolution remains relatively understudied. Specifically,
   assessing multiple hypotheses across distinct phylogenetic scales is
   essential but is rarely conducted. We examine whole body hair color and
   density variation across Indriidae (Avahi, Indri, Propithecus)-a lineage
   that, like humans, exhibits vertical posture (i.e., their whole bodies
   are vertical to the sun). Materials and methods Our analyses consider
   multiple phylogenetic scales (family-level, genus-level) and hypotheses
   (e.g., Gloger's rule, the body cooling hypotheses). We obtain hair color
   and density from museum and/or wild animals, opsin genotypes from wild
   animals, and climate data from WorldClim. To analyze our data, we use
   phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models (PGLMM) using Markov chain
   Monte Carlo algorithms. Results Our results show that across the
   Indriidae family, darker hair is typical in wetter regions. However,
   within Propithecus, dark black hair is common in colder forest regions.
   Results also show pelage redness increases in populations exhibiting
   enhanced color vision. Lastly, we find follicle density on the crown and
   limbs increases in dry and open environments. Discussion This study
   highlights how different selective pressures across distinct
   phylogenetic scales have likely acted on primate hair evolution.
   Specifically, our data across Propithecus may implicate thermoregulation
   and is the first empirical evidence of Bogert's rule in mammals. Our
   study also provides rare empirical evidence supporting an early
   hypothesis on hominin hair evolution.},

Title = {Social structure and Escherichia coli sharing in a group-living wild
   primate, Verreaux's sifaka},
Journal = {BMC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Background: Epidemiological models often use information on host social
   contacts to predict the potential impact of infectious diseases on host
   populations and the efficiency of control measures. It can be difficult,
   however, to determine whether social contacts are actually meaningful
   predictors of transmission. We investigated the role of host social
   structure in the transmission of Escherichia coli in a wild population
   of primates, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi). Using
   multilocus sequence typing (MLST), we compared genetic similarities
   between E. coli isolates from different individuals and groups to infer
   transmission pathways.
   Results: Correlation of social and transmission networks revealed that
   membership to the same group significantly predicted sharing of E. coli
   MLST sequence types (ST). Intergroup encounter rate and a measure of
   space-use sharing provided equally potent explanations for type sharing
   between social groups when closely related STs were taken into account,
   whereas animal age, sex and dispersal history had no influence. No
   antibiotic resistance was found, suggesting low rates of E. coli
   spillover from humans into this arboreal species.
   Conclusions: We show that patterns of E. coli transmission reflect the
   social structure of this group living lemur species. We discuss our
   results in the light of the species' ecology and propose scent marking,
   a type of social contact not considered in previous epidemiological
   studies, as a likely route of transmission between groups. However,
   further studies are needed to explicitly test this hypothesis and to
   further elucidate the relative roles of direct contact and environmental
   transmission in pathogen transfer.},

Abstract = {Lemur societies have been described as convergent with those of
   anthropoids, including Papio-like female-bonded multi-male groups.
   Recent research, however, shows at least 5 pair-bonded species among the
   Lemuridae and Indriidae. Three more, Eulemur mongoz, Eulemur fulvus and
   Varecia variegata, have societies combining aspects of pairing with
   aspects of troop life. The best-known female-bonded societies, those of
   Lemur catta, Propithecus diadema edwardsi and Propithecus verreauxi, may
   be assemblages of mother-daughter dyads, capable of high aggression
   towards other females, but derived from more solitary female ancestors,
   perhaps also Living as pairs. The internal structure of such lemur
   groups differs from the more extensive kin groups of catarrhines. This
   in turn may relate to the lemurs' level of social intelligence and to
   lemur female dominance over males.},

Title = {Ecological and phylogenetic correlates to body size in the Indriidae},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {28},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {I investigated ecological and phylogenetic correlates to body size
   variations in 10 taxa of extant Indriidae (Indri, Avahi, and
   Propithecus). I also tested for phylogenetic niche conservatism as a
   model for the evolution of indriid body size. Phylogenetic niche
   conservatism refers to the shared attributes that related taxa have
   acquired because they tend to have occupied similar niches during their
   evolutionary history. I collected species-specific data on body mass,
   climate, density, and chemical properties of food items from the
   literature. I used 2 phylogenies in independent contrasts methods to
   control for phylogenetic relationships (Indri and Propithecus as sister
   taxa vs. Indri basal taxa to all indriids). Multivariate models
   indicated that lemur density and resource quality are the strongest
   ecological correlates to indriid body size variations. Partitioning
   methods revealed that 52.4-67\% of indriid body size variation is
   explained by phylogenetic niche conservation. Thus, indriid body size
   variations may be the result of stabilizing selection. Though it is
   possible to identify constraints on lower than average body size, there
   are few data on selection against larger than average body size in
   indriids. Large body size in subfossil lemurs further complicates
   identification of constraints on larger than average body size in extant
   indriids. Researchers using independent contrast methods to control for
   phylogeny should be aware that some ecology-phenotype relationships are
   best explained as the result of the synergistic effects of ecology and
   phylogeny.},

Title = {The cost of deep sleep: Environmental influences on sleep regulation are

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},

Volume = {166},

Abstract = {ObjectivesPrimates spend almost half their lives asleep, yet we know
   little about how evolution has shaped variation in the duration or
   intensity of sleep (i.e., sleep regulation) across primate species. Our
   objective was to test hypotheses related to how sleeping site security
   influences sleep intensity in different lemur species.
   MethodsWe used actigraphy and infrared videography to generate sleep
   measures in 100 individuals (males=51, females=49) of seven lemur
   species (genera: Eulemur, Lemur, Propithecus, and Varecia) at the Duke
   Lemur Center in Durham, NC. We also generated experimental data using
   sleep deprivation for 16 individuals. This experiment used a pair-wise
   design for two sets of paired lemurs from each genus, where the
   experimental pair experienced a sleep deprivation protocol while the
   control experienced normal sleeping conditions. We calculated a sleep
   depth composite metric from weighted z scores of three sleep intensity
   variables.
   ResultsWe found that, relative to cathemeral lemurs, diurnal Propithecus
   was characterized by the deepest sleep and exhibited the most
   disruptions to normal sleep-wake regulation when sleep deprived. In
   contrast, Eulemur mongoz was characterized by significantly lighter
   sleep than Propithecus, and E. mongoz showed the fewest disruptions to
   normal sleep-wake regulation when sleep deprived. Security of the
   sleeping site led to greater sleep depth, with access to outdoor housing
   linked to lighter sleep in all lemurs that were studied.
   ConclusionsWe propose that sleeping site security was an essential
   component of sleep regulation throughout primate evolution. This work
   suggests that sleeping site security may have been an important factor
   associated with the evolution of sleep in early and later hominins.},

   Coquerel's sifakas (Propithecus coquereli, two cases), black \& white
   (BW) ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata variegata, six cases), red ruffed
   lemurs (Varecia rubra, seven cases), white handed gibbon (Hylobates lar
   albimana, one case), black lemurs (Eulemur macaco, three cases),
   mongoose lemurs (Eulemur mongoz, two cases), African hunting dogs
   (Lycaon pictus, five cases), agile gibbons (Hylobates agilis, three
   cases), siamangs (Hylobates syndactylus, two cases), colobus monkey
   (Colobus angolensis palliates, one case), argus pheasant (Argusianus
   argus, one case), and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus, one case). Most species
   were not symptomatic; however, three symptomatic cases in Coquerel's
   sifakas (two) and a white handed gibbon (one) showed clinical signs of
   diarrhea and lethargy that resulted in death for the Coquerel's sifakas.
   One unexpected death also occurred in a BW ruffed lemur. To the authors'
   knowledge, this is the first report of YE 1B/O:8 in such a large variety
   of zoo species. The source of the YE could not be identified, prompting
   the initiation of a diseases surveillance program to prevent further
   cases for the species that are sensitive to YE. To date, no additional
   cases have been identified, thus suggesting a single introduction of the
   YE 1B/O:8 strain into the zoo environment.},

Abstract = {Chemical deterioration of teeth is common among modern humans, and has
   been suggested for some extinct primates. Dental erosion caused by
   acidic foods may also obscure microwear signals of mechanical food
   properties. Ring-tailed lemurs at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve
   (BMSR), Madagascar, display frequent severe tooth wear and subsequent
   tooth loss. In contrast, sympatric Verreaux's sifaka. display far less
   tooth wear and infrequent tooth loss, despite both species regularly
   consuming acidic tamarind fruit. We investigated the potential impact of
   dietary acidity on tooth wear, collecting data on salivary pH from both
   species, as well as salivary pH from ring-tailed lemurs at
   Tsimanampesotse National Park, Madagascar. We also collected salivary pH
   data from ring-tailed lemurs at the Indianapolis Zoo, none of which had
   eaten for at least 12 hr before data collection. Mean salivary pH for
   the BMSR ring-tailed lemurs (8.098, n = 41, SD = 0.550) was
   significantly more alkaline than Verreaux's sifaka. (7.481, n = 26, SD =
   0.458). The mean salivary pH of BMSR (8.098) and Tsimanampesotse (8.080,
   n = 25, SD = 0.746) ring-tailed lemurs did not differ significantly.
   Salivary pH for the Indianapolis Zoo sample (8.125, n = 16, SD = 0.289)
   did not differ significantly from either the BMSR or Tsimanampesotse
   ring-tailed lemurs, but was significantly more alkaline than the BMSR
   Verreaux's sifaka sample. Regardless of the time between feeding and
   collection of pH data (from several minutes to nearly 1 hr), salivary pH
   for each wild lemur was above the ``critical{''} pH of 5.5, below which
   enamel demineralization occurs. Thus, the high pH of lemur saliva
   suggests a strong buffering capacity, indicating the impact of acidic
   foods on dental wear is short-lived, likely having a limited effect.
   However, tannins in tamarind fruit may increase friction between teeth,
   thereby increasing attrition and wear in lemurs. These data also suggest
   that salivary pH varies between lemur species, corresponding to broad
   dietary categories.},

Abstract = {Sterck and colleagues (Behaviour 134:749-774, 1997) focused attention on
   the evolutionary ecology of female social relationships within and
   between groups and proposed a model that distinguishes 4 categories of
   female relationships, which correspond to particular types of intra- and
   intergroup competition. They emphasized literature on haplorhines in
   their model because of numerous, detailed studies conducted on a range
   of species in the wild; in contrast, strepsirrhines such as the
   lemuroids are poorly represented. We evaluate more closely their
   classification of lemuroids as Dispersal-Egalitarian using a greater
   number of species of Lemur, Eulemur, Varecia, Hapalemur, Indri, and
   Propithecus. For the focal species we found that female philopatry
   occurs rarely, agonistic rates are relatively low, female dominance
   hierarchies are not stable and do not exist year-round, and intra- and
   intergroup female-female competition is infrequent. Therefore, our
   results support the suggestion that a majority of lemuroid taxa we
   surveyed correspond to the Dispersal-Egalitarian category with 2
   probable exceptions: Lemur catta and Propithecus edwardsi. Because
   female Lemur catta are philopatric, have year-round dominance
   hierarchies with female matrilines, exhibit the highest rates of agonism
   in studied lemuroids, and have frequent intra- and intergroup
   female-female competition, it would seem that they more closely
   correspond to the category Resident-Nepotistic. However, maternal Lemur
   catta rarely support their offspring in agonistic contests and
   matrilineal rank is not inherited, which leads us to state that the
   species does not fit into any existing category that explains the nature
   of female social relationships. The relationships of female Propithecus
   edwardsi are also a challenge to categorize under the current model
   because some of their characteristics -typical female dispersal and low
   agonistic rates- fall into the Dispersal-Egalitarian category, yet other
   behaviors -intense targeted aggression and stable and year-round female
   dominance hierarchies- do not.},

   to paint chromosomes of four species of Indridae (Avahi laniger, Indri
   indri, Propithecus verreauxi, and P. diadema). All human chromosome
   probes hybridized specifically to chromosome segments or to whole arms
   of indrid chromosomes. In general, the results obtained by chromosome
   painting confirm those obtained by R-banding except for some reciprocal
   translocations undetected by R-banding. Our findings confirm that in the
   evolution of the Indridae, Avahi laniger first emerges, then Indri and
   Propithecus share a common trunk. After populational evolution, this
   sister clade diverged.},

Abstract = {Seasonal dietary variations demonstrate the importance of certain plant
   parts during the year. A parallel analysis of their nutritional
   constituents provides further information on underlying patterns of
   consumption of the plant parts and the relative importance of key
   nutrients. I studied the diets of Lemur catta (ring-tailed lemurs) and
   Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi (sifakas), for 9 mo over a 13-mo period
   in the highly seasonal tropical dry forest site of Beza Mahafaly in
   southwestern Madagascar. I tested dietary plant parts for
   nutrients-protein, free amino acids, and sugars-and for 2 potential
   deterrents, phenolics and tannins, using plant extracts prepared in the
   field. I compared consumption of nutrients and secondary compounds
   throughout the year and between seasons. Nutrients are balanced
   throughout the year. The 2 lemur species do not appear nutrient-starved
   in either season, though actual quantities of nutrients and contributing
   food parts differ for each species. Lemur catta consumes high levels of
   sugar throughout the year, whereas Propithecus takes in higher levels of
   protein. The effects of phenolics and tannins are quantitative, and they
   appear to deter consumption of plant parts only past a certain
   threshold. Sifakas consume them in greater quantities than those of
   ring-tailed lemurs, which appear more sensitive to their effects.
   Sifakas may have a higher tolerance for secondary plant metabolites,
   which is consistent with reports for other folivores. The overall
   stability of nutrients throughout the year indicates no lean period that
   coincides with the decline in food abundance during the dry season,
   though actual caloric intake probably decreases.},

Title = {Ecological correlates to lemur community structure in southeast

Abstract = {The Fandriana-Marolambo forest corridor is one of the largest (ca.
   250,000 ha) and least explored tracts of unprotected forest in southeast
   Madagascar. Although published range maps show continuous distributions
   for many lemurs throughout the region, there are few data on lemur
   community structure in the corridor. We aimed to determine lemur
   community structure, with its ecological correlates (altitude,
   agriculture, selective logging, and hunting), in the Fandriana-Marolambo
   forest corridor. We surveyed 7 sites and sighted 4 nocturnal taxa (Avahi
   laniger, Cheirogaleus major, Lepilemur mustelinus, and Microcebus rufus)
   and 6 diurnal taxa (Eulemur rubriventer, E. fulvus rufus, E. f. fulvus,
   Propithecus diadema edwardsi, Hapalemur griseus griseus, and Varecia
   variegata variegata). Composition of the lemur community was broadly
   similar to that of nearby protected areas (Ranomafana and Mantadia
   National Parks). However, we sighted no Hapalemur aureus, H. simus, or
   Indri indri, and observed Propithecus diadema edwardsi and Varecia
   variegata variegata at only 1 site each. We sighted an apparent hybrid
   form of Eulemur fulvus fulvus and E. f. rufus that may represent a new
   hybrid zone for lemurs. After testing for spatial autocorrelation, lemur
   diversity correlates negatively with altitude and agricultural
   intensity. Though the Government of Madagascar is assessing the corridor
   as a new national park, we suggest conservation plans for local lemurs
   are complicated by population isolation and lack of data on minimum
   viable size of the proposed protected area.},

Abstract = {Comparative studies of highly repeated DNA from different species of
   Indriidae (Primates, Strepsirhini) allowed confirmation of the specific
   status of Avahi occidentalis, A. laniger and Propithecus tattersalli.
   The comparison of their band patterns revealed the existence of specific
   and common bands from which a cladogram of the family is inferred. This
   cladogram shows that Avahi clade is the sister-group of Indri and
   Propithecus clade, and that P. verreauxi is related to P. diadema These
   results were discussed in view of those obtained from cytogenetic,
   morphological and molecular data (mitochondrial DNA). This study shows
   the capacity of the repeated sequence pattern comparison to be used as a
   tool for confirming taxa status, (taxinomic classification is a primary
   determinant of management priorities far endangered species, neglect of
   distinct taxa may lead to their extinction), and for inferring
   phylogenetic relationships among related species.},

Abstract = {Although it is universally accepted that the Indridae family is

   the Indrinae sub-family are related. Cranium and mandible disparity
   among Indri indri, Propithecus diadema, Propithecus verreauxi and Avahi
   laniger is analysed by geometrical morphometric methods and interpreted
   in adaptive terms. We compare results obtained by two techniques:
   Procrustes superimpositions for skulls and elliptical Fourier analysis
   for jawbones. In both studies, the three genera are clearly isolated.
   Avahi laniger is the species with the most paedomorphic cranium while
   Indri indri has the most `juvenile' mandible. Cranial morphology is
   governed principally by orbit volume and body size, while jaw shape is
   related to diet (enlargement of the genial region). (C) 2000 Academie

Title = {Lateralization in seven lemur species when presented with a novel
   cognitive task},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {172},
Number = {2},
Pages = {270-279},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives Asymmetrical behavior patterns are observed in many animal
   species, but the potential adaptive significance of lateralization and
   the evolutionary forces driving it remain unclear. Most laterality
   studies have focused on a single species, which makes interspecies
   comparisons difficult. The aim of this study was to examine differences
   in the strength and direction of lateralization in multiple lemur
   species when engaged in a standardized, novel cognitive task.
   Materials and Methods We assessed laterality in seven lemur species at
   the Duke Lemur Center when using a novel puzzle-box. We recorded which
   hand opened the apparatus door and which hand picked up the food reward.
   We also recorded whether the mouth was used for either action instead of
   the hands. We then calculated handedness indices (HI), z-scores, and
   mouth-use rates.
   Results Overall, 62\% of individuals were more lateralized than chance.
   However, within-genera, there were relatively equal numbers of
   individuals with a left- or right-hand bias, which resulted in
   ambipreference at the genus level. The hand a lemur used on its first
   success in the task predicted its overall HI value, and the strength of
   lateralization increased as the number of successes increased. Varecia
   had significantly higher mouth-use rates than all other genera.
   Discussion We found evidence of an individual learning trajectory in
   which the hand used on a lemur's first success was canalized as the
   preferred (and lateralized) hand, in support of the ``cognitive
   simplicity{''} hypothesis. Individual variability in hand preference was
   high, which is consistent with previous research. Between-genera
   differences in mouth use appear to reflect species-specific feeding
   postures and differences in manual dexterity.},

Title = {Functional morphology of the lemuriform wrist joints and the

   arboreal primates},

Abstract = {A comparative study of carpal joint structure and function in six
   Malagasy lemuriforms was undertaken to test predicted morphoclines in
   carpal joint morphology between pronograde and orthograde arboreal
   primates. Patterns of movement at the wrist during locomotion were
   observed and described for the lemuriform species Lemur fulvus and
   Propithecus verreauxi. Lemur fulvus, which assumes a pronograde posture
   during locomotion, extends and pronates the wrist during the support
   phase of quadrupedal walking and running stride cycles. Furthermore, the
   forearm of this species exhibits some transverse movement across the
   proximal wrist joint during the support phase. In contrast, the indriid
   Propithecus maintains the hand and wrist in a flexed and partially
   supinated position during vertical clinging and suspensory postures.
   Habitual quadrupedal and vertical postures in Malagasy primates are in
   turn related to very different patterns of carpal joint morphology and
   articular mechanics. Those lemurs which are predominantly pronograde
   share a series of structural features related to stabilizing the
   antebrachiocarpal joint during extension and mediolateral deviation and
   the midcarpal joint during pronation: an intraarticular labrum is
   present on the inner portion of the radiocarpal ligament, the
   radiocarpal articular surface is quite flat dorsoventrally, the
   capitate-trapezoid embrasure is expanded dorsally, and development of
   the radial and ulnar styloids is more pronounced. The wrists of
   Propithecus, Avahi, and Lepilemur (vertical clingers) differ from those
   of quadrupedal lemuriforms in possessing a suite of morphological
   features related to stabilizing the wrist during antebrachiocarpal
   flexion and midcarpal supination: the radiocarpal articular surface is
   deeply curved and tilted anteriorly, the dorsal radiocarpal ligament is
   very broad, thick, and fibrous, the hamate's triquetral facet is
   directed proximodistally, and the capitate-trapezoid embrasure is
   dorsally constricted and expanded palmarly. These observed contrasts in
   carpal form and function are used to define further the morphological
   features related to orthograde posture in several lineages of arboreal
   primates. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {In order to assess the status of lemurs along the lower reaches of the
   Mahavavy in north-west Madagascar, we carried out transect line sampling
   at Anjamena between April and August 1995. These data were complemented
   by additional absence-presence surveys conducted in 1994 and 1995 in
   many of the remaining forested areas of the region. This is the first
   study of lemur population density estimates for the faunal subregion
   between the rivers Mahavavy and Betisboka. Six sympatric lemurs are
   found at Anjamena: Cheirogaleus medius, Eulemur fulvus rufus, E. mongoz,
   Lepilemur sp., Microcebus murinus and Propithecus verreauxi coronatus.
   Data suggest that in some parts of the region large numbers of lemurs
   may still be found (E. f. rufus 121 individuals per km(2), E. mongoz
   (45), Lepilemur sp. (110), M. murinus (85) and P. v. coronatus (173)).
   No density data are provided for C. medius. In conclusion, as high lemur
   population densities may still be found and, in particular, P. v.

Abstract = {Lemurs are the most olfactory-oriented of primates, yet there is still
   only a basic level of understanding of what their scent marks
   communicate. We analyzed scent secretions from Milne-Edwards' sifakas
   (Propithecus edwardsi) collected in their natural habitat of Ranomafana
   National Park, Madagascar. We sought to test whether the scent mark
   could signal genetic relatedness in addition to species, sex, season,
   and individuality. We not only found correlations (r (2) = 0.38, P =
   0.017) between the total olfactory fingerprint and genetic relatedness
   but also between relatedness and specific components of the odor,
   despite the complex environmental signals from differences in diet and
   behavior in a natural setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first demonstration of an association between genetic relatedness and
   chemical communication in a wild primate population. Furthermore, we
   found a variety of compounds that were specific to each sex and each
   sampling period. This research shows that scent marks could act as a
   remote signal to avoid inbreeding, optimize mating opportunities, and
   potentially aid kin selection.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {96},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Our current knowledge about the forces leapers generate and absorb is
   very limited and based exclusively on rigid force platform measurements.
   In their natural environments, however, leapers take off and land on
   branches and tree trunks, and these may be compliant. We evaluated the
   influence of substrate properties on leaping kinetics in prosimian
   leapers by using a combined field and laboratory approach. Tree sway and
   the timing of takeoffs relative to the movements of trees were
   documented for animals under natural conditions in Madagascar. Field
   data collected on three species (Indri indri, Propithecus diadema,
   Propithecus verreauxi) indicate that in the majority of takeoffs, the
   substrate sways and the animals takeoff before the elastic rebound of
   the substrate. This implies that force is `'wasted'' to deform supports.
   Takeoff and landing forces were measured in an experimental setting with
   a compliant force pole at the Luke University Primate Center. Forces
   were recorded for 2 Propithecus verreauxi and 3 Hapalemur griseus. Peak
   takeoff forces were 9.6 (P. verreauxi) and 10.3 (H. griseus) times body
   weight, whereas peak landing forces were 6.7 (P. verreauxi) and 8.4 (H.
   griseus) times body weight. As part of the impulse generated does not
   translate into leaping distance but is used to deform the pole, greater
   effort is required to reach a given target substrate, and, consequently,
   takeoff forces are high. The landing forces, on the other hand, are
   damped by the pole/substrate yield that increases the time available for
   deceleration. Our results contrast with previous studies of leaping
   forces recorded with rigid platform measuring systems that usually
   report higher landing than takeoff forces. We conclude that 1) Leapers
   generate and are exposed to exceptionally high locomotory forces. The
   takeoff forces are higher than the landing forces when using compliant
   supports, indicating that the takeoff rather than the landing may be
   critical in interpreting leaping behavior and related aspects of
   musculoskeletal design. 2) Large-bodied vertical clingers and leapers do
   not usually take advantage of the elastic energy stored in substrates.
   Rather, force (and energy) is wasted to deform compliant supports. 3) A
   compliant force pole approximates the conditions faced by large-bodied
   vertical clingers and leapers in the wild more closely than do rigid
   force platforms. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Opsin Gene Polymorphism Predicts Trichromacy in a Cathemeral Lemur},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {86-90},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Recent research has identified polymorphic trichromacy in three diurnal
   strepsirrhines: Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli), black and
   white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata), and red ruffed lemurs (V.
   rubra). Current hypotheses suggest that the transitions to diurnality
   experienced by Propithecus and Varecia were necessary precursors to
   their independent acquisitions of trichromacy. Accordingly, cathemeral
   lemurs are thought to lack the M/L opsin gene polymorphism necessary for
   trichromacy. In this study, the M/L opsin gene was sequenced in ten
   cathemeral blue-eyed black lemurs (Eulemur macaco flavifrons). This
   analysis identified a polymorphism identical to that of other
   trichromatic strepsirrhines at the critical amino acid position 285 in
   exon 5 of the M/L opsin gene. Thus, polymorphic trichromacy is likely
   present in at least one cathemeral Eulemur species, suggesting that
   strict diurnality is not necessary for trichromacy. The presence of
   trichromacy in E. m. flavifrons suggests that a re-evaluation of current
   hypotheses regarding the evolution of strepsirrhine trichromacy may be
   necessary. Although the M/L opsin polymorphism may have been
   independently acquired three times in the lemurid-indriid clade, the
   distribution of opsin alleles in lemurids and indriids may also be
   consistent with a common origin of trichromacy in the last common
   ancestor of either the lemurids or the lemurid-indriid clade. Am. J.

Abstract = {Relationships between tooth morphology and physical food properties are
   well established Because food breakdown is initiated by the dentition,
   one may posit that variations in tooth form are related functionally to
   the physical demands placed on them by the diet. Yet classification of
   diets as leaves, fruits, and insects does not adequately describe foods
   in mechanically significant ways. Furthermore, physical dietary
   properties have not been well quantified. I describe patterns of two
   physical food properties-hardness and shear strength-in the diets of
   five lemur taxa in Madagascar-Propithecus diadema edwardsi, Lemur fulvus
   rufus, and Lemur rubriventer-in the rain forest site of Ranomafana
   National Park and Propithecus v. verreauxi and Lemur catta at the dry
   forest site of Beta Mahafaly special reserve. I compared mean plant
   values for each lemur taxon, the most stressful foods eaten and the
   amount of time spent feeding on each dietary item. Variation in food
   hardness is a site phenomenon with fluctuations within sites. Shear
   strength is strongly seasonal. Lemur diets, as traditionally classified,
   are not mechanically uniform since frugivores and folivores could be
   separated on the basis of the physical properties of their foods.
   Finally, I assign taxa to dietary categories that are mechanically
   descriptive and derive several predictions regarding expected tooth
   morphologies from them.},

Abstract = {The lemurs of Madagascar (Primates: Lemuriformes) are a monophyletic
   group that has lived in isolation from other primates for about 50
   million years. Lemurs have diversified into species with diverse daily
   activity patterns and correspondingly different visual adaptations. We
   assessed the arrangements of retinal cone and rod photoreceptors in six
   nocturnal, three cathemeral and two diurnal lemur species and quantified
   different parameters in six of the species. The analysis revealed lower
   cone densities and higher rod densities in the nocturnal than in the
   cathemeral and diurnal species. The photoreceptor densities in the
   diurnal Propithecus verreauxi indicate a less ``diurnal{''} retina than
   found in other diurnal primates. Immunolabeling for cone opsins showed
   the presence of both middle-to-longwave sensitive (M/L) and shortwave
   sensitive (S) cones in most species, indicating at least dichromatic
   color vision. S cones were absent in Allocebus trichotis and
   Cheirogaleus medius, indicating cone monochromacy. In the Microcebus
   species, the S cones had an inverse topography with very low densities
   in the central retina and highest densities in the peripheral retina.
   The S cones in the other species and the M/L cones in all species had a
   conventional topography with peak densities in the central area. With
   the exception of the cathemeral Eulemur species, the eyes of all studied
   taxa, including the diurnal Propithecus, possessed a tapetum lucidum, a
   feature only found among nocturnal and crepuscular mammals.},

Abstract = {Primates acquire gut microbiota from conspecifics through direct social
   contact and shared environmental exposures. Host behaviour is a
   prominent force in structuring gut microbial communities, yet the extent
   to which group or individual-level forces shape the long-term dynamics
   of gut microbiota is poorly understood. We investigated the effects of
   three aspects of host sociality (social groupings, dyadic interactions,
   and individual dispersal between groups) on gut microbiome composition
   and plasticity in 58 wild Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) from
   six social groups. Over the course of three dry seasons in a 5-year
   period, the six social groups maintained distinct gut microbial
   signatures, with the taxonomic composition of individual communities
   changing in tandem among coresiding group members. Samples collected
   from group members during each season were more similar than samples
   collected from single individuals across different years. In addition,
   new immigrants and individuals with less stable social ties exhibited
   elevated rates of microbiome turnover across seasons. Our results
   suggest that permanent social groupings shape the changing composition
   of commensal and mutualistic gut microbial communities and thus may be
   important drivers of health and resilience in wild primate populations.},

Title = {Severe wear and tooth loss in wild ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta): A
   function of feeding ecology, dental structure, and individual life
   history},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {51},

Pages = {490-505},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The ring-tailed lemurs at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar,
   exhibit a high frequency of severe wear and antemortem tooth loss. As
   part of a long-term study, we collected dental data on 83 living adult
   ring-tailed lemurs during 2003 and 2004. Among these individuals, 192
   teeth were scored as absent. The most frequently missing tooth position
   is MI (24\%). As MI is the first tooth to erupt, its high frequency of
   absence (primarily a result of wear) is not remarkable. However, the
   remaining pattern of tooth loss does not correlate with the sequence of
   eruption. We suggest that this pattern is a function of 1) feeding
   ecology, as hard, tough tamarind fruit is a key fallback food of
   ring-tailed lemurs living in gallery forests; 2) food processing, as
   tamarind fruit is primarily processed in the P3-M1 region of the mouth;
   and 3) tooth structure, as ring-tailed lemurs possess thin dental
   enamel. The incongruity between thin enamel and use of a hard, tough
   fallback food suggests that ring-tailed lemurs living in riverine
   gallery forests may rely on resources not used in the past. When
   comparing dental health in the same individuals (n = 50) between 2003
   and 2004, we found that individual tooth loss can show a rapid increase
   over the span of one year, increasing by as much as 20\%. Despite this
   rapid loss, individuals are able to survive, sometimes benefiting from
   unintentional assistance from conspecifics, from which partially
   processed tamarind fruit is obtained. Although less frequent in this
   population, these longitudinal data also illustrate that ring-tailed
   lemurs lose teeth due to damage and disease, similar to other nonhuman
   primates. The relationship between tooth loss, feeding ecology, dental
   structure, and individual life history in this population has
   implications for interpreting behavior based on tooth loss in the
   hominid fossil record. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Lemur grooming has received very little attention in the literature.
   Nevertheless, allogrooming in lemurs has been suggested to be
   fundamentally different from the grooming of anthropoids. One reason is
   that lemurs generally rely on oral rather than manual grooming. Lemur
   allogrooming has also been suggested to serve less of a social function
   than has been attributed to anthropoid grooming. I analyzed the
   allogrooming behaviors of 29 Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi)
   living in five social groups in the Kirindy Forest of Madagascar. Based
   upon 1,586 observation hours, I found that sifaka, like anthropoids,
   spend very little time mutual grooming (2 +/- 3\%). Half of all
   allogrooming involved parts of the body that could have been easily
   groomed by the recipient, such as the limbs. Even though ectoparasite
   loads are expected to be greater during the rainy season, allogrooming
   did not increase during the rainy season. Allogrooming rates were
   influenced by both rank and sex, and increased by 50-100\% during the
   mating season. The results of this study suggest that allogrooming in
   Verreaux's sifaka plays an important social function, even though it is
   performed with a toothcomb. Am. J. Primatol. 72:254-261, 2010. (C) 2009

Title = {The role of the residence-effect on the outcome of intergroup encounters
   in Verreaux's sifakas},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 22},
Abstract = {Intergroup competition has an important impact on the survival and
   fitness of individuals in group-living species. However, factors
   influencing the probability of winning an encounter are not fully
   understood. We studied the influence of numerical advantage and location
   of the encounter on the chances of winning in eight neighboring groups
   of Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), in Kirindy Forest,
   western Madagascar. Intergroup encounters were inferred from spatial
   data collected via GPS loggers over a period of two years. Location,
   i.e., the proximity to the respective core area, rather than the
   numerical advantage of a group in a given encounter, influenced the
   probability of winning. Accordingly, the high value that resident groups
   attribute to exclusive and intensively used areas increased their
   motivation in defending these locations against intruders. Moreover,
   losers used the encounter area less often than winners within a month
   after the encounter, suggesting that losing also entails long-term
   costs. Thus, our results suggest that in gregarious animals the
   particular circumstances of each encounter, such as the location, can

Abstract = {Indrids are primarily vertical clingers and leapers but also engage to
   various extents in climbing, suspensory postures, bimanual movement,
   bipedal hopping, and quadrupedalism. It has been demonstrated that these
   behaviors are well reflected in the appendicular anatomy of these
   primates, while indrid vertebral anatomy has received relatively little
   attention. In this morphometric study, biomechanically relevant aspects
   of the lumbar vertebrae of Indri indri, Propithecus diadema, and
   Propithecus verreauxi were compared to those of Varecia variegata, a
   large-bodied predominantly pronograde and quadrupedal lemur. Results
   indicate that, compared to Varecia, the indrids have relatively shorter
   lumbar vertebral bodies, shorter lumbar regions, more dorsally
   projecting lumbar spinous processes, and more dorsally positioned lumbar
   transverse process tips. In addition, indrid lumbar spinous and
   transverse processes are oriented differently than those of Varecia.
   Overall, indrid lumbar vertebral morphology converges with that of
   hominoids, atelines, and possibly lorids,(1) suggesting a lumbar
   adaptation to upright or `'antipronograde'' postures that require a
   reduction in spinal flexibility. The dorsally projecting spinous
   processes may be related to back muscle extensor power during leaping
   and/or the maintenance of upright postures. By contrast, the lumbar
   vertebrae of Varecia resemble those of primates and other mammals that
   have habitually pronograde postures and emphasize spinal flexibility in
   the sagittal plane during locomotion. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Ring-tailed lemurs have been studied intensively in the Parcel 1 gallery
   forest of Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve. Here, we report on lemur groups
   in a mixture of deciduous dry forest and spiny forest just 5 km to the
   west. Compared to Parcel 1, Parcel 2 (P2) has a lower density of
   Tamarindus indica, a major dietary plant species for gallery forest
   lemurs. Recent studies in drier habitats have called into question the
   association of lemur density and tamarind presence. In order to address
   this question, we measured forest structure and composition of plant
   plots between parcels and conducted lemur feeding observations. The
   trees and shrubs within the parcels did not differ in height or diameter
   at breast height, but the frequencies of plant species that were common
   between parcels were significantly different. Numbers of feeding
   observations on foods common to both parcels did not differ, but their
   relative rankings within parcels did. Frequencies of food plants
   corresponded to earlier reports of lemur population densities. However,
   we found that the ring-tailed lemur diet is a mixture of plants that are
   eaten in abundance regardless of frequency and those that are locally
   available. In terms of their reliance on Tamarindus, P2 animals appear
   intermediate between those in gallery forests and nontamarind sites. (C)

Title = {Morphometric signals of population decline in diademed sifakas occupying
   degraded rainforest habitat in Madagascar},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic habitat change can have varied impacts on primates,
   including both negative and positive outcomes. Even when behavioural
   shifts are seen, they may reflect decreased health, or simply
   behavioural flexibility; understanding this distinction is important for
   conservation efforts. This study examines habitat-related variation in
   adult and immature morphometrics among diademed sifakas (Propithecus
   diadema). We collected morphometric data from sifakas at Tsinjoarivo,
   Madagascar (19 years, 188 captures, 113 individuals). Captures spanned
   12 groups, five within continuous forest ({''}CONT{''}), and seven in
   degraded fragments ({''}FRAG{''}) where sifakas have lower nutritional
   intakes. Few consistent differences were found between CONT and FRAG
   groups. However, using home range quality as a covariate rather than a
   CONT/FRAG dichotomy revealed a threshold: the two FRAG groups in the
   lowest-quality habitat showed low adult mass and condition (wasting),
   and low immature mass and length (stunting). Though less-disturbed
   fragments apparently provide viable habitat, we suggest the sifakas in
   the most challenging habitats cannot evolve fast enough to keep up with
   such rapid habitat change. We suggest other long-lived organisms will
   show similar morphometric ``warning signs{''} (wasting in adults,
   stunting in immatures); selected morphometric variables can thus be
   useful at gauging vulnerability of populations in the face of
   anthropogenic change.},

Abstract = {Primates tend to be long-lived, and, except for humans, most primate
   females are able to reproduce into old age. Although aging in most
   mammals is accompanied by dental senescence due to advanced wear,
   primates have low-crowned teeth that wear down before old age. Because
   tooth wear alters crown features gradually, testing whether early dental
   senescence causes reproductive senescence has been difficult. To
   identify whether and when low-crowned teeth compromise reproductive
   success, we used a 20-year field study of Propithecus edwardsi, a
   rainforest lemur from Madagascar with a maximum lifespan of >27 years.
   We analyzed tooth wear in three dimensions with dental topographic
   analysis by using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology. We
   report that tooth wear exposes compensatory shearing blades that
   maintain dental function for 18 years. Beyond this age, female fertility
   remains high; however infants survive only if lactation seasons have
   elevated rainfall. Therefore, low-crowned teeth accommodate wear to a
   point, after which reproductive success closely tracks environmental
   fluctuations. These results suggest a tooth wear-determined, but
   rainfall-mediated, onset of reproductive senescence. Additionally, our
   study indicates that even subtle changes in climate may affect
   reproductive success of rainforest species.},

Abstract = {In this study, we use deterministic and stochastic models to analyze the
   demography of Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) in a
   fluctuating rainfall environment. The model is based on 16 years of data
   from Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, southwest Madagascar. The parameters
   in the stage-classified life cycle were estimated using mark-recapture
   methods. Statistical models were evaluated using information-theoretic
   techniques and multi-model inference. The highest ranking model is
   time-invariant, but the averaged model includes rainfall-dependence of
   survival and breeding. We used a time-series model of rainfall to
   construct a stochastic demographic model. The time-invariant model and
   the stochastic model give a population growth rate of about 0.98.
   Bootstrap confidence intervals on the growth rates, both deterministic
   and stochastic, include 1. Growth rates are most elastic to changes in
   adult survival. Many demographic statistics show a nonlinear response to
   annual rainfall but are depressed when annual rainfall is low, or the
   variance in annual rainfall is high. Perturbation analyses from both the
   time-invariant and stochastic models indicate that recruitment and
   survival of older females are key determinants of population growth
   rate.},

Title = {The critical role of dietary foliage in maintaining the gut microbiome
   and metabolome of folivorous sifakas},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {The gut microbiome (GMB) of folivores metabolizes dietary fiber into
   nutrients, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs); however,
   experiments probing the consequences of foliage quality on host GMBs are
   lacking. We therefore examined GMB structure and function via amplicon
   sequencing and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy in 31 captive
   sifakas (Propithecus coquereli) during dietary manipulations associated
   with husbandry. Supplementing standard diets with diverse foliage
   blends, versus with a single plant species, promoted more diverse GMBs,
   enriched for taxa implicated in plant-fiber metabolism, but depleted in
   taxa implicated in starch metabolism and bile tolerance. The consumption
   of diverse blends was associated with greater concentrations of colonic
   SCFAs. Abundant foliage, via forest access, promoted compositionally
   distinct and more stable GMBs, but reduced concentrations of SCFAs,
   possibly reflecting selection of high-quality leaves. In 11 subjects
   denied forest access, we examined the temporal pace of microbial shifts
   when supplemental foliage was abruptly switched between diverse blends
   and single species. The sifaka GMB responded within days, with community
   diversity and composition closely tracking foliage diversity. By
   providing experimental evidence that the folivore GMB is sensitive to
   minor changes in dietary foliage, we reveal the fragility of specialist
   GMBs, with implications for managing the wellbeing of endangered
   wildlife.},

Abstract = {The importance of sites containing sacred lemurs has been stressed by

   species and the site itself remain protected. The present study concerns
   a previously overlooked site in the territory of Antrema where sacred
   lemurs (Propithecus coronatus of the Indridae family) can be found. The

Title = {Stable and transient structural variation in lemur vaginal, labial and

   and forest access},
Journal = {FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {96},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Host-associated microbiomes shape and are shaped by myriad processes
   that ultimately delineate their symbiotic functions. Whereas a host's
   stable traits, such as its lineage, relate to gross aspects of its
   microbiome structure, transient factors, such as its varying
   physiological state, relate to shorter term, structural variation. Our
   understanding of these relationships in primates derives principally
   from anthropoid studies and would benefit from a broader, comparative
   perspective. We thus examined the vaginal, labial and axillary
   microbiota of captive, female ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) and
   Coquerel's sifakas (Propithecus coquereli), across an ovarian cycle, to
   better understand their relation to stable (e.g. species identity/mating
   system, body site) and transient (e.g. ovarian hormone concentration,
   forest access) host features. We used 16S amplicon sequencing to
   determine microbial composition and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
   to measure serum hormone concentrations. We found marked variation in
   microbiota diversity and community composition between lemur species and
   their body sites. Across both host species, microbial diversity was
   significantly correlated with ovarian hormone concentrations: negatively
   with progesterone and positively with estradiol. The hosts' differential
   forest access related to the diversity of environmental microbes,
   particularly in axillary microbiomes. Such transient endogenous and
   exogenous modulators have potential implications for host reproductive
   health and behavioral ecology.},

Title = {Body size and leaping kinematics in Malagasy vertical clingers and
   leapers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {367-388},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The locomotor category of vertical clingers and leapers has been
   dominated conceptually from the beginning by its small-bodied
   representatives, galagos and tarsiers. Over the years, great
   morphological diversity has been documented within the group, much of it
   size-related. Corresponding behavioral differences remain to be
   explored, in large part because adequate data on the larger-bodied
   species were not available. The primary objective of this paper was to
   characterize the leaping kinematics of indriid primates, the much
   neglected large-bodied vertical clingers and leapers. We videotaped
   leaps of four species of indriids at four different sites in Madagascar:
   Indri indri, Propithecus diadema, Propithecus verreauxi, and Avahi
   laniger. Video images were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively
   after importing them into a computerized measuring program. Ranges of
   motion at the hip joint (a combination of extension, adduction, and
   medial rotation) probably exceed those of tarsiers and galagos. The foot
   of indriids usually releases the grip around the support and contributes
   little or nothing to propulsion, thus supporting the notion that
   indriids are `'hip'' leapers. With the forefoot stationary on the
   support, hindfoot eversion accommodates the adduction and medial
   rotation at the hip during acceleration for take off. Indriid leapers
   can be characterized as `'tarsirotators'' in contrast to
   `'tarsifulcrumating'' galagos and tarsiers. Size-related variation in
   hindlimb kinematics is surprisingly limited within the sample of indriid
   leapers, although acceleration time (the duration of the push off) does
   increase with increasing body size. In addition, forelimb kinematics
   reveal a clear size-related pattern; the smallest indriid species leaps
   with its arms tucked into the chest-like tarsiers and galagos--and the
   larger-bodied indriid species use their arms during acceleration fbr
   rake off as well as to initiate body rotation while airborne. The
   small-bodied species rely exclusively on their tails for this same
   purpose. Whereas relative tail length decreases with increasing body
   size in vertical clingers and leapers, the relative weight of the
   forelimbs increases and makes their action more effective. (C) 1996

Title = {The Nutritional Geometry of Resource Scarcity: Effects of Lean Seasons
   and Habitat Disturbance on Nutrient Intakes and Balancing in Wild
   Sifakas},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Animals experience spatial and temporal variation in food and nutrient
   supply, which may cause deviations from optimal nutrient intakes in both
   absolute amounts (meeting nutrient requirements) and proportions
   (nutrient balancing). Recent research has used the geometric framework
   for nutrition to obtain an improved understanding of how animals respond
   to these nutritional constraints, among them free-ranging primates
   including spider monkeys and gorillas. We used this framework to examine
   macronutrient intakes and nutrient balancing in sifakas (Propithecus
   diadema) at Tsinjoarivo, Madagascar, in order to quantify how these vary
   across seasons and across habitats with varying degrees of anthropogenic
   disturbance. Groups in intact habitat experience lean season decreases
   in frugivory, amounts of food ingested, and nutrient intakes, yet
   preserve remarkably constant proportions of dietary macronutrients, with
   the proportional contribution of protein to the diet being highly
   consistent. Sifakas in disturbed habitat resemble intact forest groups
   in the relative contribution of dietary macronutrients, but experience
   less seasonality: all groups' diets converge in the lean season, but
   disturbed forest groups largely fail to experience abundant season
   improvements in food intake or nutritional outcomes. These results
   suggest that: (1) lemurs experience seasonality by maintaining nutrient
   balance at the expense of calories ingested, which contrasts with
   earlier studies of spider monkeys and gorillas, (2) abundant season
   foods should be the target of habitat management, even though mortality
   might be concentrated in the lean season, and (3) primates' within-group
   competitive landscapes, which contribute to variation in social
   organization, may vary in complex ways across habitats and seasons.},

Title = {Dynamics and determinants of glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations in
   wild Verreaux's sifakas},
Journal = {HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {124},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Glucocorticoids have wide-ranging effects on animals' behaviour, but
   many of these effects remain poorly understood because numerous
   confounding factors have often been neglected in previous studies. Here,
   we present data from a 2-year study of 7 groups of wild Verreaux's
   sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), in which we examined concentrations of
   faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs, n = 2350 samples)
   simultaneously in relation to ambient temperatures, food intake, rank,
   reproduction, adult sex ratios, social interactions, vigilance and
   self-scratching. Multi-variate analyses revealed that fGCM
   concentrations were positively correlated with increases in daily
   temperature fluctuations and tended to decrease with increasing fruit
   intake. fGCM concentrations increased when males were sexually mature
   and began to disperse, and dominant males had higher fGCM concentrations
   than subordinate males. In contrast to males, older females showed a
   non-significant trend to have lower fGCM levels, potentially reflecting
   differences in male and female life-history strategies. Reproducing
   females had the highest fGCM concentrations during late gestation and
   had higher fGCM levels than non-reproducing females, except during early
   lactation. Variation in fGCM concentrations was not associated with
   variation in social interactions, adult sex ratios, vigilance and
   self-scratching. Altogether, we show that measures of glucocorticoid
   output constitute appropriate tools for studying energetic burdens of
   ecological and reproductive challenges. However, they seem to be
   insufficient indicators for immediate endocrinological responses to
   social and nonsocial behaviours that are not directly linked to energy
   metabolism.},

Abstract = {In the unique fauna assemblage of the Malagasy rain forest, lemurs
   appear to play particularly important roles as seed-dispersing
   frugivores. A three-month study of feeding ecology and seed dispersal by
   four species of lemurs in Madagascar's eastern rain forest found that
   three species, Eulemur rubriventer, Eulemur fulvus, and Varecia
   variegata were seed dispersers, and the fourth, Propithecus diadema, was
   a seed predator. In germination trials, seeds passed by lemurs sprouted
   significantly faster and in greater numbers than those not passed by
   lemurs. Analysis of fruit morphologies of 69 local plant taxa producing
   fleshy fruits during the study period found that these fruits fell into
   two well-defined color categories that correlated significantly with
   fruit size. Seventy seven percent of fleshy fruits greater than 10 mm in
   diameter were colored green, brown, tan, purplish, or black, while all
   fruits less than 10 mm in diameter were colored red, yellow, orange,
   pink, blue, or white. Three introduced exotic plant species provided
   exceptions to this pattern, producing fruits which were larger than 10
   mm and pink or orange. Fruits chosen by the primates in this study were
   usually larger than 10 mm in diameter and were in nearly all cases
   colored green, brown, tan, purplish, red, or some combination of these
   colors. Morphological traits shared by fruits of multiple plant taxa in
   the diets of seed-dispersing lemurs suggest possible coevolved
   relationships between Malagasy rain forest plants and lemurs.},

Title = {A DNA Metabarcoding Study of a Primate Dietary Diversity and Plasticity
   across Its Entire Fragmented Range},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 19},
Abstract = {In tropical regions, most primary ecosystems have been replaced by
   mosaic landscapes in which species must cope with a large shift in the
   distribution of their habitat and associated food resources. Primates
   are particularly vulnerable to habitat modifications. Most species
   persist in small fragments surrounded by complex human-mediated matrices
   whose structure and connectivity may strongly influence their dispersal
   and feeding behavior. Behavioral plasticity appears to be a crucial
   parameter governing the ability of organisms to exploit the resources
   offered by new matrix habitats and thus to persist in fragmented
   habitats. In this study, we were interested in the dietary plasticity of
   the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), an endangered
   species of lemur, found only in the Daraina region in north-eastern
   Madagascar. We used a DNA-based approach combining the barcoding concept
   and Illumina next-generation sequencing to (i) describe the species diet
   across its entire range and (ii) evaluate the influence of landscape
   heterogeneity on diet diversity and composition. Faeces from 96
   individuals were sampled across the entire species range and their
   contents were analyzed using the trnL metabarcoding approach. In
   parallel, we built a large DNA reference database based on a checklist
   of the plant species of the Daraina region. Our results suggest that
   golden-crowned sifakas exhibit remarkable dietary diversity with at
   least 130 plant species belonging to 80 genera and 49 different
   families. We highlighted an influence of both habitat type and openness
   on diet composition suggesting a high flexibility of foraging
   strategies. Moreover, we observed the presence of numerous cultivated
   and naturalized plants in the faeces of groups living in forest edge
   areas. Overall, our findings support our initial expectation that P.
   tattersalli is able to cope with the current level of alteration of the
   landscape and confirm our previous results on the distribution and the
   dispersal ability of this species.},

Title = {Subordination signals improve the quality of social relationships in
   Verreaux's Sifaka: Implications for the evolution of power structures

Year = {2019},
Volume = {169},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives Unidirectional dominance-related signals can be used to
   communicate submission (an immediate behavioral response) or
   subordination (the status of an established relationship). Subordination
   signals are defined as emitted during peaceful interactions and are
   hypothesized to be critical for the evolution of social complexity and
   robust power structures because they reduce uncertainty in social
   relationships. The chatter vocalization in Verreaux's sifaka
   (Propithecus verreauxi) is a unidirectional submissive signal. I tested
   the hypothesis that chatter vocalizations can signal subordination and
   thereby reduce agonism in a dyad. Materials and Methods I examined 780
   chatters from 18 dyads collected over 881 observation hours on four
   groups of sifaka in Kirindy Forest, Madagascar. Results Sifaka emitted
   63\% of chatters in the peaceful context. Peaceful chatters
   significantly predicted grooming rate, fighting rate, reconciliation,
   and proportion of wins in a dyad but did not predict time in proximity.
   Dyad-type significantly predicted the frequency of peaceful chatters,
   with intrasexual dyads exhibiting chatters in peaceful contexts more
   often than intersexual dyads. Discussion Sifaka communicate both
   submission and subordination with chatter vocalizations. Subordination
   signaling increased tolerance and affiliation. It reduced conflicts and
   the probability dominant individuals usurped resources. Moreover,
   intrasexual power may be more institutionalized than intersexual power
   in sifaka. The finding of complex and cognitively demanding social
   communication in a lemur with low levels of cooperation (1) challenges
   previous assumptions that the evolution of social complexity is
   dependent on frequent triadic interactions and high levels of
   cooperation, and (2) highlights the need for taxonomic diversity in
   studies of social complexity.},

Abstract = {Numerous zoologists who study diurnal lemurs on Madagascar have noted

   the most intensively studied lemurs, Propithecus verreauxi and Lemur
   catta, there are few documented cases of raptor predation. Thus, the
   maintenance of this stereotypic response is enigmatic. Bird bones
   recovered from cave surface deposits in southwestern Madagascar include
   the remains of an eagle (Aquila), a genus that has disappeared from
   Madagascar and that would have been capable of hunting animals the size
   of adult P. verreauxi and L. catta. The stereotypic response of these
   two lemurs toward raptors may have been retained from the period when
   this extinct eagle inhabited the island and is reinforced by rare acts
   of predation by extant birds of prey.},

Abstract = {The relative effect of past climate fluctuations and anthropogenic
   activities on current biome distribution is subject to increasing
   attention, notably in biodiversity hot spots. In Madagascar, where
   humans arrived in the last similar to 4 to 5,000years, the exact causes
   of the demise of large vertebrates that cohabited with humans are yet
   unclear. The prevailing narrative holds that Madagascar was covered with
   forest before human arrival and that the expansion of grasslands was the
   result of human-driven deforestation. However, recent studies have shown
   that vegetation and fauna structure substantially fluctuated during the
   Holocene. Here, we study the Holocene history of habitat fragmentation
   in the north of Madagascar using a population genetics approach. To do
   so, we infer the demographic history of two northern Madagascar
   neighbouring, congeneric and critically endangered forest dwelling lemur
   speciesPropithecus tattersalli and Propithecus perrieriusing population
   genetic analyses. Our results highlight the necessity to consider
   population structure and changes in connectivity in demographic history
   inferences. We show that both species underwent demographic fluctuations
   which most likely occurred after the mid-Holocene transition. While
   mid-Holocene climate change probably triggered major demographic changes
   in the two lemur species range and connectivity, human settlements that
   expanded over the last four millennia in northern Madagascar likely
   played a role in the loss and fragmentation of the forest cover.},

Year = {1999},
Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Female mammals commonly employ behavioral tactics of modulating activity
   levels and foraging behavior to counter the energetic burden of
   reproduction; these behavioral changes are reflected as intersexual
   differences. Traditional views of Malagasy primates posit that high
   reproductive costs select for female dominance which guarantees to
   energetically stressed females priority of resource access. I tested
   predictions regarding reproductive influences on sex differences in time
   budgets and foraging behavior using two groups of Milne-Edwards' sifaka
   (Propithecus diadema edwardsi) in southeastern Madagascar. Compared to
   males, females increased neither feeding nor resting time during
   gestation or lactation. Sex differences were essentially absent in all
   foraging time variables examined (time, duration, rate). In contrast,
   dietary composition diverged between the sexes in some months. The
   possibility that females selected particular food items to boost
   nutrient and energetic intake to meet increased requirements during
   reproduction must be further clarified with nutritional analyses. Sex
   differences in plant part choices coincided with lactation in one of the
   two study groups. Thus, the timing of sex differences in feeding
   patterns of P. d. edwardsi only partially supports the prediction that
   sex differences are most pronounced during the period of greatest female
   energetic demand. A comparative review indicated no tight association
   between female dominance and sex differences in foraging among Malagasy
   primates. Traditional female dominance theory falls short of explaining
   the observed patterns. The results of my study coupled with recent
   evidence suggest that nonbehavioral tactics involving energy
   conservation and storage require further attention as mechanisms by
   which female lemurs cope with reproductive costs.},

   playbacks of conspecific alarm calls differ when the vocalizations were
   produced in response to aerial predators as opposed to terrestrial
   predators. We conducted playback experiments on two populations of
   ringtailed lemurs, using two types of sifaka alarm calls. One population
   consisted of free-ranging groups which lived sympatrically with sifakas,
   the other was a colony group which had no contact with sifakas. The
   results illustrate that the former group of lemurs can perceive what
   type of predators the sifaka calls refer to, whereas the latter group
   was not able to recognize the difference in the calls.},

Title = {Hemoparasites in a wild primate: Infection patterns suggest interaction
   of Plasmodium and Babesia in a lemur species},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Hemoparasites can cause serious morbidity in humans and animals and
   often involve wildlife reservoirs. Understanding patterns of
   hemoparasite infections in natural populations can therefore inform
   about emerging disease risks, especially in the light of climate change
   and human disruption of natural ecosystems. We investigated the effects
   of host age, sex, host group size and season on infection patterns of
   Plasmodium sp., Babesia sp. and filarial nematodes in a population of
   wild Malagasy primates, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), as
   well as the effects of these infections on hematological variables. We
   tested 45 blood samples from 36 individuals and identified two species
   of Plasmodium, one species of Babesia and two species of filarial
   nematodes. Plasmodium spp. and Babesia sp. infections showed opposite
   patterns of age-dependency, with babesiosis being prevalent among young
   animals, while older animals were infected with Plasmodium sp. In
   addition, Babesia sp. infection was a statistically significant negative
   predictor of Plasmodium sp. infection. These results suggest that
   Plasmodium and Babesia parasites may interact within the host, either
   through cross-immunity or via resource competition, so that Plasmodium
   infections can only establish after babesiosis has resolved. We found no
   effects of host sex, host group size and season on hemoparasite
   infections. Infections showed high prevalences and did not influence
   hematological variables. This preliminary evidence supports the
   impression that the hosts and parasites considered in this study appear
   to be well-adapted to each other, resulting in persistent infections
   with low pathogenic and probably low zoonotic potential. Our results
   illustrate the crucial role of biodiversity in host-parasite
   relationships, specifically how within-host pathogen diversity may
   regulate the abundance of parasites. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Mating First, Mating More: Biological Market Fluctuation in a Wild
   Prosimian},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {In biology, economics, and politics, distributive power is the key for
   understanding asymmetrical relationships and it can be obtained by force
   (dominance) or trading (leverage). Whenever males cannot use force, they
   largely depend on females for breeding opportunities and the balance of
   power tilts in favour of females. Thus, males are expected not only to
   compete within their sex-class but also to exchange services with the
   opposite sex. Does this mating market, described for humans and apes,
   apply also to prosimians, the most ancestral primate group? To answer
   the question, we studied a scent-oriented and gregarious lemur,
   Propithecus verreauxi (sifaka), showing female dominance, promiscuous
   mating, and seasonal breeding. We collected 57 copulations involving 8
   males and 4 females in the wild (Berenty Reserve, South Madagascar), and
   data (all occurrences) on grooming, aggressions, and marking behaviour.
   We performed the analyses via exact Spearman and matrix correlations.
   Male mating priority rank correlated with the frequency of male
   countermarking over female scents but not with the proportion of fights
   won by males over females. Thus, males competed in an olfactory
   tournament more than in an arena of aggressive encounters. The
   copulation frequency correlated neither with the proportion of fights
   won by males nor with the frequency of male countermarking on female
   scents. Male-to-female grooming correlated with female-to-male grooming
   only during premating. Instead, in the mating period male-to-female
   grooming correlated with the copulation frequency. In short, the
   biological market underwent seasonal fluctuations, since males bargained
   grooming for sex in the mating days and grooming for itself in the
   premating period. Top scent-releasers gained mating priority (they mated
   first) and top groomers ensured a higher number of renewed copulations
   (they mated more). In conclusion, males maximize their reproduction
   probability by adopting a double tactic and by following market
   fluctuations.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},

Pages = {1091-1108},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The alarming rate of deforestation in Madagascar is driving some endemic
   primates to extinction. Surprisingly, anthropogenic habitat disturbance
   is not always deleterious. The effect of disturbance on lemur abundance
   may be related to diet, with frugivorous species more prone to
   population declines than folivores or insectivores. To test the effects
   of disturbance on lemur abundance and group size, we surveyed 2 sites
   within contiguous forest at Ranomafana National Park, 1 lightly
   disturbed primary forest (Vato) and 1 heavily logged forest (Tala). We
   quantified forest structure variables along 6 survey routes and
   conducted 68 diurnal and 42 nocturnal lemur surveys. Canopy closure,
   canopy height, and understory visibility were greater in Vato than in
   Tala. We encountered 2 frugivorous lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons, Varecia
   variegata) and 1 folivore (Avahi peyrierasi) significantly more
   frequently in Vato than in Tala, whereas the opposite was true for the
   insectivorous Microcebus rufus. Rates did not differ statistically for 1
   frugivore (Eulemur rubriventer) and 2 folivores (Propithecus edwardsi,
   Hapalemur griseus). Comparisons across the 6 survey routes suggest that
   the abundance was heterogeneous within as well as between sites. Neither
   group size nor composition differed between sites. Encounter rates for
   Varecia variegata were positively related to canopy closure, and
   encounter rates for Avahi peyrierasi were positively related to canopy
   height. Encounter rates for Microcebus rufus were negatively related to
   canopy closure, height, and understory visibility. Similar to other
   studies, the results suggest that some lemurs, including folivores, may
   cope with anthropogenic disturbance better than others, including some
   frugivores. Lemur abundance is heterogeneous, though, even on small
   spatial scales.},

Abstract = {In this study we use molar microwear analyses to examine the trophic
   distinctions among various taxa of Malagasy subfossil lemurs. High
   resolution casts of the teeth of Megaladapis, Archaeolemur,
   Palaeopropithecus, Babakotia, and Hadropithecus were examined under a
   scanning electron microscope. Megaladapis was undoubtedly a browsing
   folivore, but there are significant differences between species of this
   genus. However, dietary specialists appear to be the exception; for
   example, Palaeopropithecus and Babakotia probably supplemented their
   leaf-eating with substantial amounts of seed-predation, much like modern
   indrids. Hadropithecus was decidedly not like the modem gelada baboon,
   but probably did feed on hard objects. Evidence from microwear and
   coprolites suggests that Archaeolemur probably had an eclectic diet that
   differed regionally and perhaps seasonally. Substantial trophic
   diversity within Madgascar's primate community was diminished by the
   late Quaternary extinctions of the large-bodied species (>9 kg). (C)

Abstract = {Few studies have measured the prevalence of Cryptosporidium sp. and

   data of these pathogens in humans and other mammals in Tsinjoarivo.
   Fecal samples were collected May-July 2014 from lemurs (Propithecus
   diadema and Hapalemur griseus), humans, domestic animals (cattle, pigs
   and dogs), and black rats (Rattus rattus). Samples were analyzed
   utilizing immunofluorescence assay. No lemurs were positive for either
   parasite. Cryptosporidium sp. was found in humans (10\%), cattle (20\%),
   pigs (20\%), dogs (15\%) and rats (38\%), and Giardia sp. was found in
   humans (10\%), pigs (40\%), dogs (29\%) and rats (53\%). Coinfections
   were noted in humans (6\%), pigs (20\%), dogs (15\%) and rats (33\%).
   All human subjects reported daily contact with domestic animals and
   rats, and all infected humans were <= 13 years old. Human population

Abstract = {Evolutionary theories suggest that ecology is a major factor shaping
   cognition in primates. However, there have been few systematic tests of
   spatial memory abilities involving multiple primate species. Here, we
   examine spatial memory skills in four strepsirrhine primates that vary
   in level of frugivory: ruffed lemurs (Varecia sp.), ring-tailed lemurs
   (Lemur catta), mongoose lemurs (Eulemur mongoz), and Coquerel's sifakas
   (Propithecus coquereli). We compare these species across three studies
   targeting different aspects of spatial memory: recall after a
   long-delay, learning mechanisms supporting memory and recall of multiple
   locations in a complex environment. We find that ruffed lemurs, the most
   frugivorous species, consistently showed more robust spatial memory than
   the other species across tasks-especially in comparison with sifakas,
   the most folivorous species. We discuss these results in terms of the
   importance of considering both ecological and social factors as
   complementary explanations for the evolution of primate cognitive
   skills.},

Abstract = {For more than 20 years, a species of Palaeopropithecus has been
   suspected in the North-West of Madagascar. New discoveries in breccia
   from the sites of Belobaka and Ambongonambakoa permit us to describe the
   dental morphology of a new species, with a very developed parastyle and
   a mesostyle. This morphology is close to that which is found in the
   genus Propithecus. This small sized Palaeopropithecus Could probably
   chew little bits of harder food than the two larger species. The
   description of this new species occurs 100 years after the other two,
   and suggests a greater diversity of Palaeopropithecus, extinct lemurs of
   large size and moving in a suspended manner like the South-American
   sloth. To cite this article: D. Gommery et al., C. R. Palevol 8 (2009).

Abstract = {This study of two lemur species (Lemur catta and Propithecus v.
   verreauxi) in Madagascar combines observations of food procurement and
   initial food placement in the mouth with comparisons to food toughness
   and external properties. Food toughness was hypothesized to play a
   decisive role in determining food placement during ingestion. It was
   found that tougher foods are generally ingested on the postcanines for
   all foods eaten. However, when leaves and fruits are analyzed
   separately, food size and shape, represented here by mass and food type,
   are more reliable predictors of initial food placement. Larger leaves'
   and bulkier fruits and stalks are ingested posteriorly. Leaf toughness
   is not related to leaf size, though the toughness and size of the most
   commonly eaten fruits are correlated. Furthermore, ingestive food
   toughness, which is the maximum toughness, and ``average{''} food
   toughness may make different mechanical demands on the masticatory
   apparatus that have consequences for jaw morphology. (C) 2003

Title = {Stranger to Familiar: Wild Strepsirhines Manage Xenophobia by Playing},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {The power of play in limiting xenophobia is a well-known phenomenon in
   humans. Yet, the evidence in social animals remains meager. Here, we aim
   to determine whether play promotes social tolerance toward strangers in
   one of the most basal group of primates, the strepsirhines. We observed
   two groups of wild lemurs (Propithecus verreauxi, Verreaux's sifaka)
   during the mating season. Data were also collected on nine visiting,
   outgroup males. We compared the distribution of play, grooming, and
   aggressive interactions across three conditions: OUT (resident/outgroup
   interactions), IN (resident/resident interactions in presence of
   outgroups) and BL-IN (baseline of resident/resident interactions in
   absence of outgroups). Play frequency between males was higher in OUT
   than in IN and BL-IN conditions; whereas, grooming was more frequent in
   IN than in OUT and BL-IN conditions. Aggression rates between resident
   and outgroup males were significantly higher than those between
   residents. However, aggressions between resident and outgroup males
   significantly decreased after the first play session and became
   comparable with resident-resident aggression levels. The presence of
   strangers in a well-established group implies the onset of novel social
   circumstances, which sifaka males cope with by two different tactics:
   grooming with ingroup males and playing with outgroup ones. The grooming
   peak, concurrently with the visit of outgroups, probably represents a
   social shield adopted by resident males to make their pre-existing
   affiliation more evident to the stranger ``audience''. Being mostly
   restricted to unfamiliar males, adult play in sifaka appears to have a
   role in managing new social situations more than in maintaining old
   relationships. In particular, our results indicate not only that play is
   the interface between strangers but also that it has a specific function
   in reducing xenophobia. In conclusion, play appears to be an ice-breaker
   mechanism in the critical process that ``upgrades'' an individual from
   stranger to familiar.},

Abstract = {In many primate species, hands and feet are large relative to neonatal
   body weight, and they subsequently exhibit negative allometric growth
   during ontogeny. Here, data are presented showing that this pattern
   holds for a wild population of lemur, Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus
   verreauxi verreauxi). Using morphometric data collected on this
   population, it is shown that younger animals possess relatively large
   hands and feet. This ontogenetic pattern suggests a simple behavioral
   test: do juvenile animals with their larger, almost adult-sized hands
   and feet locomote on similarly sized substrates as adult animals? Using
   locomotor bout sampling, this question was tested by collecting
   positional behavior data on this population. Results from this test find
   no differences in locomotor behaviors or substrate use between yearlings
   and adult animals. To place these results in a broader evolutionary
   context, heritabilities and selection gradients of hands, feet, and
   other limb elements for animals in this population were estimated. Among
   limb elements, heritabilities range from 0.16-0.44, with the foot having
   the lowest value. Positive directional selection acts most strongly on
   the foot (directional selection gradient = 0.119). The low heritability
   and positive selection coefficient indicate that selection has acted,
   and continues to act, on foot size in young animals. These results are
   interpreted within a functional context with respect to the development
   of locomotor coordination: larger feet enable young animals to use
   ``adult-sized{''} substrates when they move through their habitat. It is
   suggested that the widespread pattern of negative allometry of the
   extremities in sifaka and other primates is maintained by selection, and
   does not simply reflect a primitive developmental pathway that has no
   adaptive basis.},

Title = {Nutritional Correlates of the ``Lean Season{''}: Effects of Seasonality

Volume = {153},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Primate field studies often identify lean seasons, when preferred foods
   are scarce, and lower-quality, abundant foods (fallback foods) are
   consumed. Here, we quantify the nutritional implications of these terms
   for two diademed sifaka groups (Propithecus diadema) in Madagascar,
   using detailed feeding observations and chemical analyses of foods. In
   particular, we sought to understand 1) how macronutrient and energy
   intakes vary seasonally, including whether these intakes respond in
   similar or divergent ways; 2) how the amount of food ingested varies
   seasonally (including whether changes in amount eaten may compensate for
   altered food quality); and 3) correlations between these variables and
   the degree of frugivory. In the lean season, sifakas shifted to
   non-fruit foods (leaves and flowers), which tended to be high in protein
   while low in other macronutrients and energy, but the average
   composition of the most used foods in each season was similar. They also
   showed dramatic decreases in feeding time, food ingested, and
   consequently, daily intake of macronutrients and energy. The degree of
   frugivory in the daily diet was a strong positive predictor of feeding
   time, amount ingested and all macronutrient and energy intakes, though
   season had an independent effect. These results suggest that factors
   restricting how much food can be eaten (e.g., handling time,
   availability, or intrinsic characteristics like fiber and plant
   secondary metabolites) can be more important than the nutritional
   composition of foods themselves in determining nutritional outcomesa
   finding with relevance for understanding seasonal changes in behavior,
   life history strategies, competitive regimes, and conservation planning.

Abstract = {Studies of primate diets usually focus on differences that distinguish
   species or populations. However, variation in diet can occur at a more
   local level of groups within a population, especially in a
   non-homogeneous habitat. I compared dietary variation in food
   composition and toughness across groups of 2 lemur species in Beza
   Mahafaly special reserve, Madagascar. Beza Mahafaly contains an 80-ha
   reserve (Parcel 1) that, while small, hosts a dense population of Lemur
   catta (ring-tailed lemurs) and Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi
   (sifakas). Microhabitats in the eastern vs. western sides of the parcel
   are structurally and floristically distinct. Sifakas in this parcel have
   small, discrete home ranges and are morphological folivores. For these
   reasons, I expected that the 6 groups studied would eat a different menu
   of food plants but with similar toughness values. Ring-tailed lemurs
   have comparatively large, overlapping home ranges, and I expected that
   the 5 study groups would eat similar foods. Despite living in different
   microhabitats across the parcel, sifakas exhibit high dietary uniformity
   both in dietary plant species composition and the toughness of the
   foods. Food selection in sifakas operates on two distinct levels. Sifaka
   groups share many key food species that appear independent of local
   abundances, but the ranking of the foods within each group appears
   related to availability. Ring-tailed lemur groups are more heterogeneous
   in the composition of their diets relative to sifakas, though the time
   spent feeding on individual foods reveals a marked preference for the
   fruits of Tamarindus indica by all groups. Food toughness is consistent
   across the parcel with the exception of the most western group.
   Ring-tailed lemurs are highly specific feeders, but indiscriminate
   nibblers. Sifakas are targeted, balanced feeders. There does not appear
   to be a consistent microhabitat effect operating across species.
   Differences within sifaka and ring-tailed lemur populations in food
   composition and toughness, however, correspond to an east-west
   microhabitat gradient. Measures of dietary flexibility must take into
   account not only the plant species consumed and the different parts
   eaten but also their associated food properties and proportion of time
   spent feeding on them.},

Abstract = {Social complexity, often estimated by group size, is seen as driving the
   complexity of vocal signals, but its relation to olfactory signals,
   which arguably arose to function in nonsocial realms, remains
   underappreciated. That olfactory signals also may mediate within-group
   interaction, vary with social complexity and promote social cohesion
   underscores a potentially crucial link with sociality. To examine that
   link, we integrated chemical and behavioural analyses to ask whether
   olfactory signals facilitate reproductive coordination in a
   strepsirrhine primate, the Coquerel's sifaka, Propithecus coquereli.

   the diurnal, group-living sifaka represents an interesting test case.
   Convergent with diurnal, group-living lemurids, sifakas expressed
   chemically rich scent signals, consistent with the social complexity
   hypothesis for communication. These signals minimally encoded the sex of
   the signaller and varied with female reproductive state. Likewise, sex
   and female fertility were reflected in within-group scent investigation,
   scent marking and overmarking. We further asked whether, within breeding
   pairs, the stability or quality of the pair's bond influences the
   composition of glandular signals and patterns of investigatory or
   scent-marking behaviour. Indeed, reproductively successful pairs tended
   to show greater similarity in their scent signals than did
   reproductively unsuccessful pairs, potentially through chemical
   convergence. Moreover, scent marking was temporally coordinated within
   breeding pairs and was influenced by past reproductive success. That
   olfactory signalling reflects social bondedness or reproductive history
   lends support to recent suggestions that the quality of relationships
   may be a more valuable proxy than group size for estimating social
   complexity. We suggest that olfactory signalling in sifakas is more
   complex than previously recognized and, as in other socially integrated
   species, can be a crucial mechanism for promoting group cohesion and
   maintaining social bonds. Thus, the evolution of sociality may well be
   reflected in the complexity of olfactory signalling. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {Lemurs are notable for encompassing the range of body-size variation for
   all primates past and present-close to four orders of magnitude.
   Benefiting from the phylogenetic proximity of subfossil lemurs to
   smaller-bodied living forms, we employ allometric data from the skull to
   probe the ontogenetic bases of size differentiation and morphological
   diversity across these clades. Building upon prior pairwise comparisons
   between sister taxa, we performed the first clade-wide analyses of
   craniomandibular growth allometries in 359 specimens from 10 lemuroids
   and 176 specimens from 8 indrioids. Ontogenetic trajectories for extant
   forms were used as a criterion of subtraction to evaluate morphological
   variation, and putative adaptations among sister taxa. In other words,
   do species-level differences in skull form result from the differential
   extension of common patterns of relative growth?
   In lemuroids, a pervasive pattern of ontogenetic scaling is observed for
   facial dimensions in all genera, with three genera also sharing relative
   growth trajectories for jaw proportions (Lemur, Eulemur, Varecia).
   Differences in masticatory growth and form characterizing Hapalemur and
   fossil Pachylemur likely reflect dietary factors. Pervasive ontogenetic
   scaling characterizes the facial skull in extant Indri, Avahi, and
   Propithecus, as well as their larger, extinct sister taxa
   Mesopropithecus and Babakotia. Significant interspecific differences are
   observed in the allometry of indrioid masticatory proportions, with
   variation in the mechanical advantage of the jaw adductors and
   stress-resisting elements correlated with diet. As the growth series and
   adult data are largely coincidental in each clade, interspecific
   variation in facial form may result from selection for body-size
   differentiation among sister taxa. Those cases where trajectories are
   discordant identify potential dietary adaptations linked to variation in
   masticatory forces during chewing and biting. Although such
   dissociations highlight selection to uncouple shared ancestral growth
   patterns, they occur largely via transpositions and retention of
   primitive size-shape covariation patterns or relative growth
   coefficients. Am. J. Primatol. 72:161-172, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {When compared with their recently extinct relatives, living lemurs
   represent a mere fraction of a broad radiation that occupied unique
   niches in the recent past. Among living lemurs, indrids exhibit the
   fastest rates of dental development. This dental precocity is tightly
   correlated with rapid pace of postnatal dental eruption, early
   replacement of the deciduous teeth, high dental endowment at weaning,
   and relatively slow somatic growth. This pattern is in stark contrast to
   that seen in extant lemurids, where somatic development is highly
   accelerated and dental development is relatively slow. We report on the
   pace of dental development in one species of palaeopropithecid, the
   sister group to extant indrids. Like much smaller modern indrids, the
   chimpanzee-sized Palaeopropithecus ingens was dentally precocious at
   birth as evidenced by the advanced state of molar crown formation. This
   finding implies a pattern characteristic of Propithecus and other
   indrids-rapid dental development despite relatively prolonged gestation.
   Gestation length in this one species of subfossil lemur was likely
   greater than 9 months. Our results demonstrate that large body size in
   primates does not preclude exceedingly rapid dental development.},

Abstract = {We provide male and female census count data, age-specific survivorship,
   and female age-specific fertility estimates for populations of seven
   wild primates that have been continuously monitored for at least 29
   years: sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) in Madagascar; muriqui

   beringei) in Rwanda. Using one-year age-class intervals, we computed
   point estimates of age-specific survival for both sexes. In all species,
   our survival estimates for the dispersing sex are affected by heavy
   censoring. We also calculated reproductive value, life expectancy, and
   mortality hazards for females. We used bootstrapping to place confidence
   intervals on life-table summary metrics (R-0, the net reproductive
   rate;., the population growth rate; and G, the generation time). These
   data have high potential for reuse; they derive from continuous
   population monitoring of long-lived organisms and will be invaluable for
   addressing questions about comparative demography, primate conservation

Abstract = {Understanding the way prosimian primates age can be helpful in inferring
   what the `basal primate mode' of senescence may have been. Even though
   prosimians are known to be long-lived in captivity, relatively little is
   known about their reproductive senescence, and even less is known about
   how prosimians age in their natural habitats. Twenty years of
   observational data in Madagascar for four Propithecus edwordsi sifaka
   groups were used to analyze reproductive and behavioral trends of aging
   in the wild. Techniques using tooth wear were developed to establish
   ages of wild sifakas and to estimate the onset of their `dental
   senescence', a proxy for the onset of decline in the ability to obtain
   nutrition. Estimated maximum longevity was 32 years for female sifakas.
   Based on the loss of dental functional morphology, and changes in tooth
   wear patterns and in chewing efficiency, dental senescence was estimated
   to set in at approximately 18 years of age. Of the adult females in the
   study groups, the yearly average of the number of dentally senescent
   females was 24\%. There was no indication of a decline in fertility in
   the dentally senescent females (aged > 18 years) compared to younger
   adult females (aged 4-18 years). The field data showed, however, that in
   years when rain was decreased during months of prime lactation, infants
   of dentally senescent mothers died before weaning. This may be because
   the nursing mother's worn teeth could not shear leaves and extract
   moisture, nor nutrition, both essential for successful lactation. Old
   females showed no clear signs of social disengagement, further
   suggesting that drought-induced stress plays a direct role in increased
   infant mortality. These data support earlier findings that prosimian
   females continue to cycle and give birth until death. The effect of
   environmental variation on infant survival, however, indicates an
   incipient age-linked decline in reproductive fitness. Therefore, whereas
   lemurs represent the condition of no menopause, changes in infant
   survival may uncover selective factors that have in part led to the
   evolution of menopause in other primates. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger

Abstract = {We assessed the consumption and hunting of wild animals by people in
   urban areas of western Madagascar using structured questionnaires in
   households and direct observations. Six wild mammal and five wild bird
   species were reported, or observed, to be sources of bushmeat although
   fish and domestic animals were the preferred and cheapest sources of
   animal protein. Bushmeat accounted for 10\% of the meat consumed the day
   before our questionnaires were completed. Common tenrec Tenrec ecaudatus
   and bush pig Potamochoerus larvatus were the preferred wild meat and the
   former was also the most expensive type of meat. Taboos and strong
   dislikes limited the consumption of domestic pigs, bush pigs, goats,
   lemurs and fruit bats. Game species were hunted according to their
   availability, which coincided with the legal hunting season for fruit
   bats but only partly so for the other game species. Illegal hunting of
   Verreauxi's sifaka Propithecus verreauxi is cause for concern and
   assessments of primate consumption may have been underestimated because
   of reluctance of interviewees to admit illegal activities.},

Abstract = {This study reports the molecular and morphologic characterization of a
   Cryptosporidium sp., identified in stools of captive lemurs Propithecus
   verreauxi coquereli. Stool samples were collected from seven animals (n
   = 7) presenting episodes of diarrhea. Bright-field light microscopy of
   stool smears stained with modified acid-fast technique revealed the
   presence of Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts in four of the stool samples
   analyzed. All microscopically positive samples were confirmed by PCR
   using primers designed to amplify DNA fragments from two independent
   loci, i.e. the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene and the
   small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) gene. Phylogenetic analysis based
   on the full-length ssrRNA gene placed this isolate within a clade that
   contains all currently known C parvum species/genotypes, closely related
   to the C parvum pig genotype. Comparison with partial ssrRNA sequences
   available in the GenBank(TM) revealed 100\% sequence identity with the
   genotype previously identified in Canadian patients. This finding was
   confirmed further by comparison of the COWP gene partial sequences.

Title = {Hierarchical social networks shape gut microbial composition in wild

Abstract = {In wild primates, social behaviour influences exposure to
   environmentally acquired and directly transmitted microorganisms. Prior
   studies indicate that gut microbiota reflect pairwise social
   interactions among chimpanzee and baboon hosts. Here, we demonstrate
   that higher-order social network structure-beyond just pairwise
   interactions-drives gut bacterial composition in wild lemurs, which live
   in smaller and more cohesive groups than previously studied anthropoid
   species. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and social network analysis of
   grooming contacts, we estimate the relative impacts of hierarchical
   (i.e. multilevel) social structure, individual demographic traits, diet,
   scent-marking, and habitat overlap on bacteria acquisition in a wild
   population of Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) consisting of
   seven social groups. We show that social group membership is clearly
   reflected in the microbiomes of individual sifaka, and that social
   groups with denser grooming networks have more homogeneous gut microbial
   compositions. Within social groups, adults, more gregarious individuals,
   and individuals that scent-mark frequently harbour the greatest
   microbial diversity. Thus, the community structure of wild lemurs
   governs symbiotic relationships by constraining transmission between
   hosts and partitioning environmental exposure to microorganisms. This
   social cultivation of mutualistic gut flora may be an evolutionary
   benefit of tight-knit group living.},

Title = {Blood transcriptomes reveal novel parasitic zoonoses circulating in
   Madagascar's lemurs},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Zoonotic diseases are a looming threat to global populations, and nearly
   75\% of emerging infectious diseases can spread among wildlife, domestic
   animals and humans. A `One World, One Health' perspective offers us an
   ideal framework for understanding and potentially mitigating the spread
   of zoonoses, and the island of Madagascar serves as a natural laboratory
   for conducting these studies. Rapid habitat degradation and climate
   change on the island are contributing to more frequent contact among
   humans, livestock and wildlife, increasing the potential for pathogen
   spillover events. Given Madagascar's long geographical isolation,
   coupled with recent and repeated introduction of agricultural and
   invasive species, it is likely that a number of circulating pathogens
   remain uncharacterized in lemur populations. Thus, it is imperative that
   new approaches be implemented for de novo pathogen discovery. To this
   end, we used non-targeted deep sequencing of blood transcriptomes from
   two species of critically endangered wild lemurs (Indri indri and
   Propithecus diadema) to characterize blood-borne pathogens. Our results
   show several undescribed vector-borne parasites circulating within
   lemurs, some of which may cause disease in wildlife, livestock and
   humans. We anticipate that advanced methods for de novo identification
   of unknown pathogens will have broad utility for characterizing other
   complex disease transmission systems.},

Title = {PRINS analysis of the telomeric sequence in seven lemurs},
Journal = {CHROMOSOME RESEARCH},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-65},
Abstract = {We examined the chromosomal localization of the telomeric sequence,
   (TTAGGG)(n), in seven species of the lemurs and one greater galago, as
   an outgroup, using the primed in-situ labeling (PRINS) technique. As
   expected, the telomeric sequence was identified at both ends of all
   chromosomes of the eight prosimians. However, six species showed a
   signal at some pericentromeric regions involving constitutive
   heterochromatin as well. The pericentromeric region of chromosome 1 of
   Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) was labeled with a
   large and intense signal. The range of the signal considerably exceeded
   the area of DAPI positive heterochromatin. On the other hand, in the
   five lemurs, a large signal was detected also in the short arm of
   acrocentric chromosomes. Acquisition of the large block of the telomeric
   sequence into the acrocentric short arm might be interpretable in terms
   of the tandem growth of the heterochromatic short arm and the reciprocal
   translocation between heterochromatic short arms involving the telomeric
   sequence. Subsequently, it was postulated that meta- or submetacentric
   chromosomes possessing the telomeric sequence at the pericentromeric
   region could be formed by centric fusion between such acrocentric
   chromosomes.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {97},
Number = {4},
Pages = {357-366},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Subfossil specimens of Indri indri have been recovered recently from the
   Ankarana Massif cave system in the far north of Madagascar. Taken
   together with material from the central highland site of Ampasambazimba,
   the range of this species appears to have once included much of the
   northern half of the island and to have extended north and west beyond
   the eastern rainforest (not unlike Hapalemur simus), It is probable that
   forest corridors connected the subfossil localities to the current range
   at some time in the past. Climatic desiccation (fluctuating or
   long-term) and/or human degradation of the environment may have created
   the disjunct distributions of living and subfossil I. indri. It is also
   possible that I. indri once included populations or subspecies that were
   better adapted to dry forest, woodland, or mosaic environments, habitats
   very different from those occupied by their living conspecifics. Such
   adaptive diversity would have been similar to that of Propithecus
   diadema which today has subspecies in the montane forests and one (P.d.
   perrieri) in the dry forests of the northeast. These discoveries add new
   information on range extensions to the distributional database for the
   primates of Madagascar, and illustrate the piecemeal process of their
   extinctions. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Gut Site and Gut Morphology Predict Microbiome Structure and Function in
   Ecologically Diverse Lemurs},
Journal = {MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {Most studies of wildlife gut microbiotas understandably rely on feces to
   approximate consortia along the gastrointestinal tract. We therefore
   compared microbiome structure and predicted metagenomic function in
   stomach, small intestinal, cecal, and colonic samples from 52 lemurs
   harvested during routine necropsies. The lemurs represent seven genera
   (Cheirogaleus, Daubentonia, Varecia, Hapalemur, Eulemur, Lemur,
   Propithecus) characterized by diverse feeding ecologies and gut
   morphologies. In particular, the hosts variably depend on fibrous
   foodstuffs and show correlative morphological complexity in their large
   intestines. Across host lineages, microbiome diversity, variability,
   membership, and function differed between the upper and lower gut,
   reflecting regional tradeoffs in available nutrients. These patterns
   related minimally to total gut length but were modulated by fermentation
   capacity (i.e., the ratio of small to large intestinal length).
   Irrespective of feeding strategy, host genera with limited fermentation
   capacity harbored more homogenized microbiome diversity along the gut,
   whereas those with expanded fermentation capacity harbored cecal and
   colonic microbiomes with greater diversity and abundant fermentative
   Ruminococcaceae taxa. While highlighting the value of curated sample
   repositories for retrospective comparisons, our results confirm that the
   need to survive on fibrous foods, either routinely or in hypervariable
   environments, can shape the morphological and microbial features of the
   lower gut.},

Abstract = {Although play is seen in many species, its evolutionary function is
   still largely unknown. Several relevant, proposed hypotheses (such as
   the training for the unexpected, self-assessment, social skills, and
   dominance hierarchy hypotheses) make predictions about how animals
   should optimally choose their play partners based on their familiarity
   or other demographic variables. We used a social network approach to
   analyze focal sample data on brown capuchins (Cebus apella), hamadryas
   baboons (Papio hamadryas), and diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema) to
   understand how these species choose their play partners with respect to
   demographic variables. Using exponential random graph models (ERGMs), we
   found that sifaka and capuchins generally tended to play with animals
   who were similar to them. The baboons were only sensitive to age
   differences in the formation of strong play relationships. Our data most
   strongly support the training for the unexpected hypothesis, asaccording
   to predictionsall species preferred to play with animals who were their
   close social partners, decreasing the possibility of cheating during
   play. Through the first application (to our knowledge) of ERGMs to
   primate behavior, we were able to compare the effects of many
   demographic variables on the complex, interdependent social structure of
   primates. Applying this tool to additional groups and species will
   provide further insight into evolutionary mechanisms of play behavior
   across taxa.},

Title = {Faecal glucocorticoid metabolite profiles in diademed sifakas increase
   during seasonal fruit scarcity with interactive effects of age/sex class
   and habitat degradation},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {We measured faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (GCs) in Critically
   Endangered diademed sifaka to understand how food availability,
   nutritional intake and habitat disturbance impact stress physiology. GCs
   elevated with food scarcity and correlated negatively with feeding time.
   Attenuated GCs in fragmented forest groups suggest a downregulated
   response to a chronically poor environment.
   Abstract Glucocorticoids are metabolic byproducts of animals'
   physiological responses to ecological or social challenges and are
   thought to represent an adaptive response allowing beneficial responses
   to short-term challenges. Glucocorticoid metabolites (GCs) can be
   assayed non-invasively through faeces and therefore can be a useful tool
   to gauge the health of populations experiencing natural and/or
   anthropogenic stressors. However, the response of GCs to anthropogenic
   stressors varies, with both higher and lower GC levels reported. Here,
   we describe variation in GC secretion within eight diademed sifaka
   (Propithecus diadema) groups across 1 year. These groups span a gradient
   of anthropogenic habitat disturbance, including groups in continuous
   forest (CONT') and disturbed fragments (FRAG'), and indicators of health
   suggest that FRAG groups are negatively impacted by habitat disturbance.
   We monitored phenology, used focal animal follows to quantify diet and
   collected faeces (n = 547) from which we quantified GC content using
   enzyme immunoassay. All groups showed elevated lean-season GCs, but with
   a single, brief peak. GCs were inversely correlated with feeding time.
   No overall effect of habitat (CONT vs. FRAG) was found, but the
   lean-season peak was significantly higher in CONT groups. There was a
   significant season{*}age-sex interaction; adult females had an
   attenuated lean-season response compared with groupmates. The observed
   lean-season challenge' is consistent with previous lemur studies, as
   well as mammals in general. Low and largely invariable GC levels in
   FRAG, within the context of observed health and nutritional declines,
   suggest that FRAG groups employ a strategy whereby the adrenal response
   to stressors is downregulated. More research is needed to contextualize
   our observations of GC variation and health on an individual level, both
   in terms of corroborating evidence for ecological and social stressors,
   and longer-term quantification of reproductive success and fitness.},

Title = {Lemur responses to edge effects in the Vohibola III Classified Forest,
   Madagascar},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Pages = {293-299},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Forest edges are dynamic zones characterized by the penetration (to
   varying depths and intensities) of conditions from the surrounding
   environment (matrix) into the forest interior. Although edge effects
   influence many tropical organisms, they have not been studied directly
   in primates. Edge effects are particularly relevant to lemurs because of
   the highly fragmented forest landscapes found in Madagascar. In this
   study, data are presented regarding how the densities of six lemur
   species (Avahi laniger, Cheirogaleus major, Eulemur rubriventer,
   Hapalemur griseus griseus, Microcebus rufus, and Propithecus diadema
   edwardsi) varied between six 500-m interior transects and six 500-m edge
   transects in the Vohibola III Classified Forest in SE Madagascar.
   Diurnal (n = 433) and nocturnal (n = 128) lemur surveys were conducted
   during June-October 2003 and May-November 2004. A. laniger, E.
   rubriventer, and H. g. griseus exhibited a neutral edge response (no
   differences in densities between habitats). M. rufus and P. d. edwardsi
   had a positive edge response (higher densities in edge habitats), which
   may be related to edge-related variations in food abundance and quality.
   Positive edge responses by M. rufus and P. d. edwardsi may ultimately be
   detrimental due to edge-related anthropogenic factors (e.g., hunting by
   local people). The negative edge response exhibited by C. major (lower
   densities in edge habitats) may result from heightened ambient
   temperatures that inhibit torpor in edge habitats.},

Title = {Phylogenetic relationships among the Malagasy lemuriforms (Primates :

Journal = {ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY},
Year = {2001},

Abstract = {Numerous phylogenetic hypotheses have been advanced for the Malagasy
   lemuriform radiation, drawing on data from morphology, physiology,
   behaviour and molecular genetics. Almost all possible relationships have
   been proposed, and most nodes have been contested. We present a
   phylogenetic analysis, using several analytical methods, of a partial
   sequence from the 12S rRNA mitochondrial gene. This gene codes for the
   small ribosomal subunit, and functional constraints require that the
   secondary structure of the molecule is strongly conserved, which in turn
   exerts constraints on the primary sequence structure. Although previous
   studies have suggested a very wide range of phylogenetic applicability
   for this molecule, our results indicate that it is most useful in
   strepsirrhine primates for estimating relationships among genera within
   families and among relatively recently diverged families (mean sequence
   divergence about 11\%). Relationships among families separated by larger
   genetic distances (>12\% divergence; e.g. Cheirogaleidae,
   Daubentoniidae, Megaladapidae) are difficult to resolve consistently.
   Our data show strong support for an Indridae-Lemuridae sister group and
   for monophyly of the Lemuridae with Varecia as the sister to all other
   lemurids. They also support, albeit less strongly, sister group
   relationships between Lemur and Hapalemur within the Lemuridae and
   between Propithecus and Avahi in the Indridae. (C) 2001 The Linnean

Title = {Nitrogen isotope (delta N-15) patterns for amino acids in lemur bones

Abstract = {Most endemic species with body masses >10 kg on Madagascar went extinct
   within the past 1000 years. The extent to which human predation,
   anthropogenic landscape transformation and aridification may separately
   or together explain this extinction pattern remains controversial. We
   present nitrogen isotope (delta N-15) values of individual amino acids
   preserved in bones from now-extinct Pachylemur insignis and extant
   Propithecus verreauxi from two subfossil sites in south-western
   Madagascar: Tsirave and Taolambiby. The amino acid-specific approach
   allows us to identify environmental signals that are otherwise difficult
   to recognize in bulk collagen delta N-15 values. Specifically, we use
   the delta N-15 values of source amino acids (phenylalanine and lysine)
   as a proxy for habitat aridity between ca. 4000 years ago and present
   and the spacing of delta N-15 values between trophic and source amino
   acids to quantify trophic levels for these two lemur species. Despite
   paleoenvironmental evidence for lowering water tables and the expansion
   of relatively arid savanna between 4000 and 1000 years ago, our isotope
   data suggest that these lemurs did not live in increasingly arid
   habitats and did not change their trophic level. Together, our results
   support the hypothesis that aridity alone did not play a major role in
   late Holocene megafaunal extinctions in south-western Madagascar.},

Abstract = {Environmental enrichment is a tool used to promote the welfare and
   well-being of captive animals by encouraging the display of
   species-specific behaviors and reducing the stress or boredom induced by
   captive environments. Lemurs are highly endangered, yet few studies have
   analyzed the behavioral impacts of enrichment on captive populations. We
   studied the impacts of two novel enrichment devices on three lemur
   species (ring-tailed lemurs {[}Lemur catta], red-ruffed lemurs
   {[}Varecia rubra], and Coquerel's sifaka {[}Propithecus coquereli]) to
   determine both the overall and species-specific impacts of enrichment on
   lemur behavior. We recorded lemur behavior using the continuous sampling
   method to obtain behavior duration and analyzed our results using ANOVA
   Repeated Measures. Results showed enrichment effectiveness differed for
   each species and that different enrichment devices had varying impacts
   on lemur behavior across all species. We attributed the differences in
   species-specific responses to the unique locomotor patterns and methods
   of diet acquisition of each species, and the variances in behavioral
   responses across all species to the characteristics of each device. Our
   study highlights the importance of species-specific enrichment and
   encourages further research in this field in order to maximize the
   positive effects of enrichment, which in turn has the potential to
   affect the overall well-being of captive populations.},

Abstract = {Primates face many climate and land use change threats, making long-term
   population monitoring critical to prioritizing conservation efforts.
   Ground-based line transects are typically conducted to estimate and
   monitor primate populations. However, transects may be costly and
   logistically challenging. We sought to test whether low-cost (<5,000
   USD), ready-to-use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could effectively
   monitor primate populations in north-eastern Madagascar. Critically
   Endangered {[}A3cd] golden-crowned sifakas (Propithecus tattersalli) are
   medium-sized, white lemurs whose creamy colour contrasts against
   defoliated tree canopies, making them an ideal study species for aerial
   counts. Quad-copter UAV flights over sifaka groups did not elicit
   antipredator responses. Photographs demonstrated the ability of UAVs to
   capture viable imagery of sifakas from approximately 20 m above ground
   level. Unfortunately, crashes resulting from an inability to programme
   automated flights over hilly forests cut this pilot study short,
   highlighting several challenges that remain to implementing UAVs in
   remote field studies. This study demonstrates that while UAVs offer
   considerable promise in the future of primate research and conservation,
   high start-up costs and remote field conditions provide challenging
   obstacles to first time users hoping to use this exciting new
   technology. Furthermore, we strongly recommend that thermal cameras be
   used for direct primate counts with UAVs.},

Abstract = {Light is the primary synchronizer of all biological rhythms, yet little
   is known about the role of the 24-hour luminous environment on nonhuman
   primate circadian patterns, making it difficult to understand the photic
   niche of the ancestral primate. Here we present the first data on
   proximate light-dark exposure and activity-rest patterns in free-ranging
   nonhuman primates. Four individuals each of five species of lemurs at
   the Duke Lemur Center (Eulemur mongoz, Lemur catta, Propithecus
   coquereli, Varecia rubra, and Varecia variegata variegata) were fitted
   with a Daysimeter-D pendant that contained light and accelerometer
   sensors. Our results reveal common as well as species-specific light
   exposure and behavior patterns. As expected, all five species were more
   active between sunrise and sunset. All five species demonstrated an
   anticipatory increase in their pre-sunrise activity that peaked at
   sunrise with all but V. rubra showing a reduction within an hour. All
   five species reduced activity during mid-day. Four of the five stayed
   active after sunset, but P. coquereli began reducing their activity
   about 2 hours before sunset. Other subtle differences in the recorded
   light exposure and activity patterns suggest species-specific photic
   niches and behaviors. The eventual application of the Daysimeter-D in
   the wild may help to better understand the adaptive evolution of
   ancestral primates. Am J Phys Anthropol 153:68-77, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley

Title = {A massively parallel strategy for STR marker development, capture, and
   genotyping},
Journal = {NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Number = {15},
Month = {SEP 6},
Abstract = {Short tandem repeat (STR) variants are highly polymorphic markers that
   facilitate powerful population genetic analyses. STRs are especially
   valuable in conservation and ecological genetic research, yielding
   detailed information on population structure and short-term demographic
   fluctuations. Massively parallel sequencing has not previously been
   leveraged for scalable, efficient STR recovery. Here, we present a
   pipeline for developing STR markers directly from high-throughput
   shotgun sequencing data without a reference genome, and an approach for
   highly parallel target STR recovery. We employed our approach to capture
   a panel of 5000 STRs from a test group of diademed sifakas (Propithecus
   diadema, n = 3), endangered Malagasy rainforest lemurs, and we report
   extremely efficient recovery of targeted loci--97.3-99.6\% of STRs
   characterized with >= 10x non-redundant sequence coverage. We then
   tested our STR capture strategy on P. diadema fecal DNA, and report
   robust initial results and suggestions for future implementations. In
   addition to STR targets, this approach also generates large, genomewide
   single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels from flanking regions. Our
   method provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for rapid
   recovery of large STR and SNP datasets in any species without needing a
   reference genome, and can be used even with suboptimal DNA more easily
   acquired in conservation and ecological studies.},

Abstract = {Fecal samples from captive and free-living lemurs at Ivoloina Zoological
   Park (IZP) and domestic carnivores from six villages surrounding IZP
   were evaluated between July and August 2012. Free-living lemurs from
   Betampona Natural Reserve (BNR), a relatively pristine rainforest
   fragment 40 km away, were also evaluated in November 2013. All 33 dogs
   sampled (100\%) and 16 of 22 cats sampled (72.7\%) were parasitized,
   predominantly with nematodes (strongyles, ascarids, and spirurids) as
   well as cestodes and protozoans. Similar types of parasites were
   identified in the lemur populations. Identification of spirurid
   nematodes and protozoans in the lemur fecal samples were of concern due
   to previously documented morbidity and mortality in lemurs from these
   parasitic agents. Twelve of 13 free-living (93\%) and 31 of 49 captive
   (63\%) lemurs sampled at IZP had a higher parasite prevalence than
   lemurs at BNR, with 13 of 24 (54\%) being parasitized. The lemurs in BNR
   are likely at risk of increased exposure to these parasites and,
   therefore, increased morbidity and mortality, as humans and their
   domestic animals are encroaching on this natural area.},

Abstract = {We describe the diet of fossas (Cryptoprocta ferox) in a dry deciduous
   forest of western Madagascar from 376 scats collected between June 1994
   and September 1996, from which 554 prey items were identified. More than
   90\% of these were vertebrates, and more than 50\% were lemurs. No other
   nonprimate mammal includes such a high proportion of primate items in
   its diet. The principal prey comprised approximately 6 lemur species and
   2 or 3 spiny tenrec species, along with snakes and small mammals.
   Significant differences were apparent in the composition of the scats in
   wet and dry seasons, with a higher proportion of Tenrec in the former,
   and fewer lemurs. Within the confines of a diet of vertebrates, fossas
   appeared to be opportunistic predators. For those prey types for which
   data were available, a significant relationship was found between the
   estimated relative number of individuals taken of any one type of prey
   and its abundance. Fossas were estimated to remove up to 19\% of their
   prey populations per year. This high impact suggests that they were
   living close to the maximum population density possible on the available
   prey. Species of a wide range of body masses were included in the diet.
   Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi), weighing more than one-half
   of the body mass of the fossa, constituted approximately 11\% of the
   prey biomass.},

Abstract = {Alarm vocalizations are a common feature of the mammalian antipredator
   response. The meaning and function of these calls vary between species,
   with some species using calls to reference-specific categories of
   predators. Species can also use more than just the calls of conspecifics
   to detect threat, `eavesdropping' on other species' signalling to avoid
   predation. However, the evidence to date for both referential signalling
   and eavesdropping within primates is limited. We investigated two
   sympatric populations of wild lemur, the Coquerel's sifaka Propithecus
   coquereli and the common brown lemur Eulemur fulvus, presenting them
   with playbacks of predator calls, conspecific alarm calls and
   heterospecific lemur alarm calls, and recorded their behavioural
   responses following the playbacks. Results suggest that the Coquerel's
   sifaka may have functionally referential alarm calls with high
   specificity for aerial predators, but there was no evidence for any
   referential nature of the other call investigated. Brown lemurs appear
   to have a mixed alarm system, with one call being specific with respect
   to aerial predators. The other call investigated appeared to reference
   terrestrial predators. However, it was also used in other contexts, so
   does not meet the criteria for functional reference. Both species showed
   evidence for heterospecific alarm call recognition, with both the
   Coquerel's sifaka and the brown lemurs responding appropriately to
   heterospecific aerial alarm calls.},

Abstract = {Genetic analyses are well suited to address many research questions in
   the study of wild populations, yet species of interest often have
   distributions that are geographically distant from molecular
   laboratories, necessitating potentially lengthy transport of biological
   specimens. Performing basic genetic analyses on site would avoid the
   project delays and risks of sample quality decline associated with
   transport, as well as allow original specimens to remain in the country
   of origin. Further, diagnostic genetic assays performed in the field
   could provide real-time information allowing for more nimble adjustments
   to research plans and use of resources. To this end, we developed
   protocols for reliably performing front-end genetics bench work in the
   field, without the requirements of electricity or permanent shelter. We
   validated these protocols on buccal swabs collected during routine
   capturing of sifaka lemurs (Propithecus verreauxi) at BezA Mahafaly
   Special Reserve in Southwest Madagascar and faecal samples collected
   from captive sifakas (P. coquereli) at the Duke Lemur Center. Our basic
   protocol pipeline involves a chelating resin based DNA extraction
   followed by whole genome amplification or polymerase chain reaction
   using reagents stored at ambient temperature and portable, compact
   equipment powered by a lightweight solar panel. We achieved a high
   success rate (> 80\%) in downstream procedures, demonstrating the
   promise of such protocols for performing basic genetic analyses in a
   broad range of field situations.},

Title = {Patterns of Gut Bacterial Colonization in Three Primate Species},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 13},
Abstract = {Host fitness is impacted by trillions of bacteria in the
   gastrointestinal tract that facilitate development and are inextricably
   tied to life history. During development, microbial colonization primes
   the gut metabolism and physiology, thereby setting the stage for adult
   nutrition and health. However, the ecological rules governing microbial
   succession are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the
   relationship between host lineage, captive diet, and life stage and gut
   microbiota characteristics in three primate species (infraorder,
   Lemuriformes). Fecal samples were collected from captive lemur mothers
   and their infants, from birth to weaning. Microbial DNA was extracted
   and the v4 region of 16S rDNA was sequenced on the Illumina platform
   using protocols from the Earth Microbiome Project. Here, we show that
   colonization proceeds along different successional trajectories in
   developing infants from species with differing dietary regimes and
   ecological profiles: frugivorous (fruit-eating) Varecia variegata,
   generalist Lemur catta, and folivorous (leaf-eating) Propithecus
   coquereli. Our analyses reveal community membership and succession
   patterns consistent with previous studies of human infants, suggesting
   that lemurs may serve as a useful model of microbial ecology in the
   primate gut. Each lemur species exhibits distinct species-specific
   bacterial diversity signatures correlating to life stages and life
   history traits, implying that gut microbial community assembly primes
   developing infants at species-specific rates for their respective adult
   feeding strategies.},

Title = {Exploratory analysis reveals arthropod consumption in 10 lemur species
   using DNA metabarcoding},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {83},
Number = {6, SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Arthropods (insects, spiders, etc.) can fulfill major nutritional
   requirements for primates, particularly in terms of proteins, fats,
   vitamins, and minerals. Yet, for many primate species we know very
   little about the frequency and importance of arthropod consumption.
   Traditional methods for arthropod prey identification, such as
   behavioral observations and fecal dissections, offer limited taxonomic
   resolution and, as a result, underestimate true diversity. Metabarcoding
   arthropod DNA from primate fecal samples provides a promising but
   underused alternative. Here, we inventoried arthropod prey diversity in
   wild lemurs by sequencing two regions of the CO1 gene. Samples were
   collected opportunistically from 10 species of lemurs inhabiting three
   national parks in southern Madagascar using a combination of focal
   animal follows and live trapping. In total, we detected arthropod DNA in
   98 of the 170 fecal samples analyzed. Although all lemur species
   included in these analyses showed evidence of arthropod consumption,
   those within the family Cheirogaleidae appeared to consume the highest
   frequency and diversity of arthropods. To our knowledge, this study
   presents the first evidence of arthropod consumption in Phaner
   pallescens, Avahi peyrierasi, and Propithecus verreauxi, and identifies
   32 families of arthropods as probable food items that have not been
   published as lemur dietary items to date. Our study emphasizes the
   importance of arthropods as a nutritional source and the role DNA
   metabarcoding can play in elucidating an animal's diet.},

Title = {Light levels used during feeding by primate species with different color

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {58},
Number = {6},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The intensity of available light is important in determining how well a
   diurnal animal can distinguish color. Primates with different types of
   color vision may exhibit behaviors that maximize visual contrast during
   critical activities such as feeding. We hypothesized that (1)
   trichromatic taxa will feed in a wide range of light conditions because
   color constancy permits stabilized color appearance across changes in
   illumination, and (2) that taxa with a high proportion of dichromatic
   individuals will tend to feed at higher light levels to increase color
   contrast. We recorded light levels during feeding bouts of seven primate
   taxa with varying degrees of color vision: the dichromatic Lemur catta,
   two polymorphic species, Propithecus v. verreauxi and Ateles geoffroyi,
   and the routine trichromats, Alouatta palliata, Colobus guereza,
   Piliocolobus badius, and Cercopithecus ascanius. Results were equivocal
   for our hypotheses. While routinely trichromatic taxa used varying light
   levels, the pattern of results did not differ from the dichromatic Lemur
   catta. However, polymorphic taxa not only sought the highest light, but
   females, which are the only individuals in polymorphic taxa that can be
   trichromatic, fed in higher light levels than males when eating
   non-green foods. This result is consistent with selection operating to
   maintain a balanced polymorphism in these taxa, though the connection
   between light levels and color vision type for the females is unclear.
   Our results further suggest that trichromatic vision may afford a
   selective advantage because it permits foraging under a greater range of
   light levels.},

Title = {Genetic consequences of social structure in the golden-crowned sifaka},
Journal = {HEREDITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {125},
Number = {5},
Pages = {328-339},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Many species are structured in social groups (SGs) where individuals
   exhibit complex mating strategies. Yet, most population genetic studies
   ignore SGs either treating them as small random-mating units or focusing
   on a higher hierarchical level (the population). Empirical studies
   acknowledging SGs have found an overall excess of heterozygotes within
   SGs and usually invoke inbreeding avoidance strategies to explain this
   finding. However, there is a lack of null models against which
   ecological theories can be tested and inbreeding avoidance quantified.
   Here, we investigateinbreeding(deviation from random mating) in an
   endangered forest-dwelling pair-living lemur species (Propithecus
   tattersalli). In particular, we measure the inbreeding coefficient
   (F-IS) in empirical data at different scales: SGs, sampling sites and
   forest patches. We observe high excess of heterozygotes within SGs. The
   magnitude of this excess is highly dependent on the sampling scheme:
   while offspring are characterised by a high excess of heterozygotes
   (F-IS < 0), the reproductive pair does not show dramatic departures from
   Hardy-Weinberg expectations. Moreover, the heterozygosity excess
   disappears at larger geographic scales (sites and forests). We use a
   modelling framework that incorporates details of the sifaka mating
   system but does not include active inbreeding avoidance mechanisms. The
   simulated data show that, although apparent ``random mating{''} or
   eveninbreedingmay occur at the ``population{''} level, outbreeding is
   maintained within SGs. Altogether our results suggest that social
   structure leads to high levels of outbreeding without the need for
   active inbreeding avoidance mechanisms. Thus, demonstrating and
   measuring the existence of active inbreeding avoidance mechanisms may be
   more difficult than usually assumed.},

Title = {Edge effects and their influence on lemur density and distribution in

Abstract = {Edge effects are caused by the penetration of abiotic and biotic
   conditions from the matrix into forest interiors. Although edge effects
   influence the biogeography of many tropical organisms, they have not
   been studied directly in primates. Edge effects are particularly
   relevant to lemurs due to the loss of 80-90\% of forests in Madagascar.
   In this study, data are presented on how biotic edge effects influenced
   the distribution and density of lemurs in the Vohibola III Classified
   Forest in southeastern Madagascar. In total, 415 lemur surveys were
   conducted during June-October 2003 and May-September 2004 along six
   1,250-m transects that ran perpendicular to the forest edge. Data were
   also collected on lemur food trees along the six transects (density,
   height, diameter at breast height, area, volume, and distance to forest
   edge). Four nocturnal species (Avahi laniger, Cheirogaleus major,
   Lepilemur microdon, and Microcebus rufus) and four diurnal species
   (Eulemur rubriventer, Eulemur fulvus rufus, Hapalemur grisesus griseus,
   and Propithecus diadema edwardsi) were sighted during surveys.
   Regression analyses of lemur densities as a function of distance to
   forest edge provided edge tolerances for A. laniger (edge-tolerant), M.
   rufus (edge-tolerant), E. rubriventer (edge-tolerant or omnipresent),
   and H. g. griseus (omnipresent). The density and distribution of M.
   rufus and their foods trees were correlated. Edge-related variations in
   food quality and predation pressures may also be influencing lemurs in
   Vohibola III. Tolerance for edge effects may explain, in part, how
   lemurs have survived extreme habitat loss and forest fragmentation in
   southeastern Madagascar. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Many mammals warn conspecifics with alarm calls about detected
   predators. These alarm calls are either functionally referential,
   urgency based, or they can have multiple functions, including predator
   deterrence. The taxonomic distribution of these alarm call systems is
   uneven, with primates providing the best-known examples for a
   functionally referential system and rodents most examples of an
   urgency-based system. Reports of different alarm call systems in lemurid
   primates prompted us to examine the anti-predator behavior of two
   additional lemur species, In an experimental field study we exposed
   adult redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus) and white sifakas
   (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) to playbacks of vocalizations of their
   main aerial and terrestrial predators, as well as to their own alarm
   calls given in response to the presentation of these predators. We
   scored the subjects' immediate behavioral responses, including alarm
   calls, from video recordings made during the first minute following a
   playback. We found that both species gave specific alarm calls only in
   response to raptor playbacks and the corresponding alarm calls, whereas
   calls given in response to carnivores and the corresponding alarm calls
   were also observed in other situations characterized by high arousal.
   Other behavioral responses, such as gaze and escape directions,
   corresponded to the hunting strategies of the two predator classes,
   suggesting that the corresponding vocalizations were categorized
   correctly. These two lemur species, which represent different families,
   have therefore independently evolved a mixed alarm call system,
   characterized by functionally referential calls for diurnal raptors, but
   not for carnivores.},

Abstract = {The impact of climate change and anthropogenic deforestation on
   biodiversity is of growing concern worldwide. Disentangling how past
   anthropogenic and natural factors contributed to current biome
   distribution is thus a crucial issue to understand their complex
   interactions on wider time scales and to improve predictions and
   conservation strategies. This is particularly important in biodiversity
   hotspots, such as Madagascar, dominated by large open habitats whose
   origins are increasingly debated. Although a dominant narrative argues
   that Madagascar was originally entirely covered by woodlands, which were
   destroyed by humans, a number of recent studies have suggested that past
   climatic fluctuations played a major role in shaping current biome
   distributions well before humans arrived. Here, we address the question
   of the origin of open habitats in the Daraina region in northern
   Madagascar, using a multiproxy approach combining population genetics
   modeling and remote-sensing analyses. We show that (i) contrary to most
   regions of Madagascar, the forest cover in Daraina remained remarkably
   stable over the past 60 y, and (ii) the golden-crowned sifaka
   (Propithecus tattersalli), a forest-dwelling lemur, underwent a strong
   population contraction before the arrival of the first humans, hence
   excluding an anthropogenic cause. Prehuman Holocene droughts may have
   led to a significant increase of grasslands and a reduction in the
   species' habitat. This contradicts the prevailing narrative that land
   cover changes are necessarily anthropogenic in Madagascar but does not
   preclude the later role played by humans in other regions in which
   recent lemur bottlenecks have been observed.},

Abstract = {Hapalemur sps. and Prolemur simus (bamboo lemurs, collectively) stand
   out from the relatively homogeneous lemurids because they are bamboo
   feeders and vertical clingers and leapers. This unique diet presents
   equally unique challenges, like its verticality, toughness, and
   toxicity. The bamboo lemurs share the generalized anatomy of the other
   lemurids, but also display some well-documented skeletal adaptations,
   perhaps to overcome the problems presented by their specialization.
   Soft-tissue adaptations, however, remain largely unexplored. Explored
   here are possible soft-tissue adaptations in Hapalemur griseus. We
   compare H. griseus with other lemurids, Propithecus, Galago, Tarsier,
   and a tree shrew. Based on the available anatomical and physiological
   data, we hypothesize that Hapalemur and Prolemur species will have
   differences in hindlimb morphology when compared with other lemurids. We
   predict that H. griseus will have more hindlimb muscle mass and will
   amplify muscle mass differences with increased type II muscle fibers.
   Relative hindlimb muscle mass in H. griseus is less than other
   prosimians sampled, yet relative sural muscle mass is significantly
   heavier (P < 0.01) in H. griseus. Results show that the soleus muscle of
   H. griseus has a higher amount of type II (fast) fibers in
   plantarflexors. These findings indicate although H. griseus shares some
   generalized lemurid morphology, its diet of bamboo may have pushed this
   generalized lemurid to an anatomical extreme. We suspect additional
   bamboo-specific adaptations in their anatomy and physiology will be
   uncovered with further examination into the anatomy of the bamboo
   lemurs. Anat Rec, 2019. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Anat Rec,

Title = {Jaw Elevator Muscle Coordination during Rhythmic Mastication in
   Primates: Are Triplets Units of Motor Control?},
Journal = {BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-14},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The activity of mammal jaw elevator muscles during chewing has often
   been described using the concept of the triplet motor pattern, in which
   triplet I (balancing side superficial masseter and medial pterygoid;
   working side posterior temporalis) is consistently activated before
   triplet II (working side superficial masseter and medial pterygoid;
   balancing side posterior temporalis), and each triplet of muscles is
   recruited and modulated as a unit. Here, new measures of unison,
   synchrony, and coordination are used to determine whether in 5 primate
   species (Propithecus verreauxi, Eulemur fulvus, Papio anubis, Macaca
   fuscata,and Pan troglodytes)muscles in the same triplet are active more
   in unison, are more synchronized, and are more highly coordinated than
   muscles in different triplets. Results show that triplet I muscle pairs
   are active more in unison than other muscle pairs in Eulemur, Macaca,
   and Papio,buttriplet muscle pairs are mostly not more tightly
   synchronized than non-triplet pairs. Triplet muscles are more
   coordinated during triplet pattern cycles than non-triplet cycles, while
   non-triplet muscle pairs are more coordinated during non-triplet cycles
   than triplet cycles. These results suggest that the central nervous
   system alters patterns of coordination between cycles, recruiting
   triplet muscles as a coordinated unit during triplet cycles but
   employing a different pattern of muscle coordination during non-triplet
   cycles. The triplet motor pattern may simplify modulation of rhythmic
   mastication by being one possible unit of coordination that can be
   recruited on a cycle-to-cycle basis.},

Abstract = {Recent paleontological discoveries in Madagascar document the existence
   of a diverse clade of palaeopropithecids or `'sloth lemurs'':
   Mesopropithecus (three species), Babakotia (one species),
   Palaeopropithecus (three species), and Archaeoindris (one species), This
   mini-radiation of now extinct (''subfossil'') lemurs is most closely
   related to the living indrids (Indri, Propithecus, and Avahi). Whereas
   the extant indrids are known for their leaping acrobatics, the
   palaeopropithecids (except perhaps for the poorly known giant
   Archaeoindris) exhibit numerous skeletal design features for
   antipronograde or suspensory positional behaviors (e.g., high
   intermembral indices and mobile joints). Here we analyze the curvature
   of the proximal phalanges of the hands and feet, Computed as the
   included angle (theta), phalangeal curvature develops in response to
   mechanical use and is known to be correlated in primates with hand and
   foot function in different habitats; terrestrial species have straighter
   phalanges than their arboreal counterparts, and highly suspensory forms
   such as the orangutan possess the most curved phalanges, Sloth lemurs as
   a group are characterized by very curved proximal phalanges, exceeding
   those seen in spider monkeys and siamangs, and approaching: that of
   orangutans. Indrids have curvatures roughly half that of sloth lemurs,
   and the more terrestrial, subfossil Archaeolemur possesses the least
   curved phalanges of all the indroids. Taken together with many other
   derived aspects of their postcranial anatomy, phalangeal curvature
   indicates that the sloth lemurs are one of the most suspensory clades of
   mammals ever to evolve.},

Abstract = {Phylogeographic barriers, together with habitat loss and fragmentation,
   contribute to the evolution of a species' genetic diversity by limiting
   gene flow and increasing genetic differentiation among populations.
   Changes in connectivity can thus affect the genetic diversity of
   populations, which may influence the evolutionary potential of species
   and the survival of populations in the long term. We studied the genetic
   diversity of the little known Northern rufous mouse lemur (Microcebus
   tavaratra), endemic to Northern Madagascar. We focused on the population
   of M. tavaratra in the Loky-Manambato region, Northern Madagascar, a
   region delimited by two permanent rivers and characterized by a mosaic
   of fragmented forests. We genotyped 148 individuals at three
   mitochondrial loci (D-loop, cytb, and cox2) in all the major forests of
   the study region. Our analyses suggest that M. tavaratra holds average
   genetic diversity when compared to other mouse lemur species, and we
   identified two to four genetic clusters in the study region, a pattern
   similar to that observed in another lemur endemic to the region
   (Propithecus tattersalli). The main cluster involved samples from the
   two mountain forests in the study region, which were connected until
   recently. However, the river crossing the study region does not appear
   to be a strict barrier to gene flow in M. tavaratra. Finally, the
   inferred demographic history of M. tavaratra suggests no detectable
   departure from stationarity over the last millennia. Comparisons with
   codistributed species (P. tattersalli and two endemic rodents, Eliurus
   spp.) suggest both differences and similarities in the genetic clusters
   identified (i.e., barriers to species dispersal) and in the inferred
   demographic history. These comparisons suggest that studies of
   codistributed species are important to understand the effects of
   landscape features on species and to reconstruct the history of habitat
   changes in a region.},

Title = {Novel approach for quantifying illegal bushmeat consumption reveals high

Abstract = {Information on the extent of bushmeat hunting is needed to assess the
   likely impact on hunted species, to provide information on the
   opportunity cost to local people of conservation, and to judge the
   efficacy of interventions at reducing pressure. However, where hunting
   is illegal, or socially unacceptable, respondents may not answer
   honestly to direct questions about hunting or consumption of bushmeat.
   We adapted a specialized method for investigating sensitive behaviours
   (the randomized response technique, RRT) and questioned 1,851 people in
   Madagascar about their consumption of six species, using either RRT or
   direct questions. For most species at most sites RRT and direct
   questions returned similar estimates of the proportion of the population
   who had consumed bushmeat in the previous year. However, RRT resulted in
   significantly higher estimates of bushmeat consumption in communities
   surrounding a protected area, where conservation activities made such
   questions sensitive. RRT has been predominately used in Europe and the
   USA; we demonstrate that it can provide a valuable approach for studying
   rule-breaking among people with poor literacy in low income countries.
   Between 12 and 33\% of people across our sites had eaten brown lemur
   (Eulemur spp.), and 12-29\% had eaten sifaka (Propithecus spp.) in the
   previous year. These results add to the growing body of evidence that
   hunting of protected species in Madagascar is a serious problem
   requiring urgent action. Conservation interventions to tackle bushmeat
   hunting will make questions about hunting or consumption more sensitive,
   increasing the need for researchers to use appropriate approaches for
   asking sensitive questions.},

Title = {Adaptive and phylogenetic significance of ontogenetic sequences in

Abstract = {Among the best known of recently extinct Malagasy lemurs is
   Archaeolemur, which is represented by many hundreds of specimens. The
   phylogenetic affinities of this taxon are unclear, especially in light
   of recent preliminary analysis of ancient DNA which does not support its
   previously accepted close relationship with the living Indridae. We
   examined the nearly complete skeletons of two adults and one juvenile
   and other less complete specimens to reconstruct aspects of the ontogeny
   of Archaeolemur. To compare the development of Archaeolemur to that of
   living strepsirrhines we collected data on Propithecus verreauxi,
   Eulemur fulvus, and Lemur catta. Additionally, because Archaeolemur
   exhibits some morphological convergences with distantly related
   papionins, we tested for convergence in the developmental patterns of
   Archaeolemur and Macaw fascicularis. Data include the status of tooth
   eruption, craniofacial sutural closure, and post-cranial epiphyseal
   fusion, as well as linear measurements. We used discriminant function
   analysis and other tools to explore ontogenetic similarities and
   differences.
   The adaptive and phylogenetic significance of ontogenetic information is
   discussed. Our analysis shows that Archaeolemur displays a clear
   strepsirrhine pattern of development with only minor macaque
   convergences. Among the Strepsirrhini, Archaeolemur is slightly more
   similar developmentally to E. fulvus and L. catta than to P. verreauxi.
   Some of the distinctive features of the ontogeny of Archaeolemur may be
   related to diet, while others bear apparent testimony to a relatively
   rapid absolute pace of growth and development. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

Title = {Enriched sleep environments lengthen lemur sleep duration},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Characteristics of the sleep-site are thought to influence the quality
   and duration of primate sleep, yet only a handful of studies have
   investigated these links experimentally. Using actigraphy and infrared
   videography, we quantified sleep in four lemur species (Eulemur
   coronatus, Lemur catta, Propithecus coquereli, and Varecia rubra) under
   two different experimental conditions at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in
   Durham, NC, USA. Individuals from each species underwent three weeks of
   simultaneous testing to investigate the hypothesis that comfort level of
   the sleep-site influences sleep. We obtained baseline data on normal
   sleep, and then, in a pair-wise study design, we compared the daily
   sleep times, inter-daily activity stability, and intra-daily activity
   variability of individuals in simultaneous experiments of sleep-site
   enrichment and sleep-site impoverishment. Over 164 24-hour periods from
   8 individuals (2 of each species), we found evidence that enriched
   sleep-sites increased daily sleep times of lemurs, with an average
   increase of thirty-two minutes. The effect of sleep-site impoverishment
   was small and not statistically significant. Though our experimental
   manipulations altered inter-daily stability and intra-daily variability
   in activity patterns relative to baseline, the changes did not differ
   significantly between enriched and impoverished conditions. We conclude
   that properties of a sleep-site enhancing softness or insulation, more
   than the factors of surface area or stability, influence lemur sleep,
   with implications regarding the importance of nest building in primate
   evolution and the welfare and management of captive lemurs.},

Title = {Sleep influences cognitive performance in lemurs},
Journal = {ANIMAL COGNITION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {5},
Pages = {697-706},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Primates spend almost half their lives asleep, yet little is known about
   how sleep influences their waking cognition. We hypothesized that
   diurnal and cathemeral lemurs differ in their need for consistent,
   non-segmented sleep for next-day cognitive function-including long-term
   memory consolidation, self-control, foraging efficiency, and sociality.
   Specifically, we expected that strictly diurnal Propithecus is more
   reliant on uninterrupted sleep for cognitive performance, as compared to
   four other lemur species that are more flexibly active (i.e.,
   cathemeral). We experimentally inhibited sleep and tested next-day
   performance in 30 individuals of 5 lemur species over 960 total nights
   at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, North Carolina. Each set of
   pair-housed lemurs experienced a sleep restriction and/or deprivation
   protocol and was subsequently tested in a variety of fitness-relevant
   cognitive tasks. Within-subject comparisons of performance on these
   tasks were made by switching the pair from the experimental sleep
   inhibited condition to a normal sleep environment, thus ensuring
   cognitive equivalency among individuals. We validated effectiveness of
   the protocol via actigraphy and infrared videography. Our results
   suggest that `normal' non-disrupted sleep improved memory consolidation
   for all lemurs. Additionally, on nights of normal sleep, diurnal lemurs
   performed better in foraging efficiency tasks than cathemeral lemurs.
   Social behaviors changed in species-specific ways after exposure to
   experimental conditions, and self-control was not significantly linked
   with sleep condition. Based on these findings, the links between sleep,
   learning, and memory consolidation appear to be evolutionarily conserved
   in primates.},

Title = {Evaluating the triplet hypothesis during rhythmic mastication in
   primates},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {221},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Mammalian mastication involves precise jaw movements including
   transverse movement of the mandible during the power stroke. Jaw
   elevation and transverse movement are driven by asymmetrical jaw
   elevator muscle activity, which is thought to include a phylogenetically
   primitive and conserved triplet motor pattern consisting of: triplet I
   (balancing side: superficial masseter and medial pterygoid; working
   side: posterior temporalis), which reaches onset, peak and offset first;
   and triplet II (working side: superficial masseter and medial pterygoid;
   balancing side: posterior temporalis), which is active second. Although
   the presence of a triplet motor pattern has been confirmed in several
   primate species, the prevalence of this motor pattern -i.e. the
   proportion of masticatory cycles that display it -has not been evaluated
   in primates. The present study quantifies the presence and prevalence of
   the triplet motor pattern in five different primate species, Eulemur
   fulvus, Propithecus verreauxi, Papio anubis, Macaca fuscata and Pan
   troglodytes, using mean onset, peak and offset time relative to working
   superficial masseter. In all five of the species studied, the mean
   triplet motor pattern was observed at peak muscle activation, and in
   four out of the five species the triplet motor pattern occurred more
   frequently than expected at random at peak muscle activation and offset.
   Non-triplet motor patterns were observed in varying proportions at
   different time points in the masticatory cycle, suggesting that the
   presence or absence of the triplet motor pattern is not a binomial
   trait. Instead, the primate masticatory motor pattern is malleable
   within individual cycles, within individual animals and therefore within
   species.},

Title = {Environmental Correlates of Body Mass in True Lemurs (Eulemur spp.)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-108},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {An organism's body size is intrinsically related to its metabolic
   requirements, life history profile, and ecological niche. Previous work
   in primates generally, and lemurs specifically, has shown that body size
   often correlates with ecological parameters related to temperature and
   energy availability in the environment, although other studies indicate
   the absence of any such patterns in lemurs. Here we test hypotheses that
   predict that body mass in Eulemur should covary with 1) overall food
   availability or resource seasonality and/or 2) temperature, i.e.,
   Bergmann's rule. We use data from 722 wild true lemurs to identify
   population-specific body mass for 27 populations representing 11 of the
   12 described Eulemur species, and derive climatic data for each
   population from the WorldClim database. We use phylogenetic generalized
   least squares models to evaluate these hypotheses and find that body
   mass significantly negatively correlates with annual mean temperature
   and positively correlates with standard deviation of temperature, but
   does not significantly correlate with annual rainfall or number of dry
   months. These results indicate that body mass distribution across
   populations in Eulemur is consistent with Bergmann's rule, but does not
   track resource seasonality as seen in other lemurs, e.g., Propithecus.
   We suggest that the fact that body mass in various lemur radiations
   correlates with different environmental variables may result in these
   patterns being obscured when such taxa are combined in a single
   analysis. This may help explain why some previous work has found little
   evidence of ecogeographical correlates with body mass across all

Abstract = {Lemurs are highly endangered mammals inhabiting the forests of
   Madagascar. In this study, we performed virus discovery on serum samples
   collected from 84 wild lemurs and identified viral sequence fragments
   from 4 novel viruses within the family Flaviviridae, including members
   of the genera Hepacivirus and Pegivirus. The sifaka hepacivirus (SifHV,
   two genotypes) and pegivirus (SifPgV, two genotypes) were discovered in
   the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema), while other pegiviral
   fragments were detected in samples from the indri (Indri indri, IndPgV)
   and the weasel sportive lemur (Lepilemur mustelinus, LepPgV). Although
   data are preliminary, each viral species appeared host species-specific
   and frequent infection was detected (18 of 84 individuals were positive
   for at least one virus). The complete coding sequence and partial 5' and
   3' untranslated regions (UTRs) were obtained for SifHV and its genomic
   organization was consistent with that of other hepaciviruses, with one
   unique polyprotein and highly structured UTRs. Phylogenetic analyses
   showed the SifHV belonged to a clade that includes several viral species
   identified in rodents from Asia and North America, while SifPgV and
   IndPgV were more closely related to pegiviral species A and C, that
   include viruses found in humans as well as New- and Old-World monkeys.
   Our results support the current proposed model of virus-host
   co-divergence with frequent occurrence of cross-species transmission for
   these genera and highlight how the discovery of more members of the
   Flaviviridae can help clarify the ecology and evolutionary history of
   these viruses. Furthermore, this knowledge is important for conservation
   and captive management of lemurs.},

Title = {The importance of taboos and social norms to conservation in Madagascar},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {976-986},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Informal institutions governing the use of wild species are present in
   many societies. A system of prohibitions known as fady is central to
   Malagasy culture. We examined whether fady that relate to the use of
   natural resources in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar play an
   important conservation role. Prohibitions ranged from strict taboos in
   which a species or area was forbidden by the ancestors to social norms
   that concerned acceptable behavior when harvesting wild species. Strict
   taboos offered real protection to threatened species, such as the lemur
   Propithecus edwardsi and the carnivore Cryptoprocta ferox. Taboos also
   reduced pressure on some economically important endemic species by
   preventing their sale or limiting the harvest season. Despite their
   value for conservation, the taboos did not appear to originate from
   attempts to sustainably manage resources. Nevertheless, social norms, in
   which the sanction was social disapproval rather than supernatural
   retribution, encouraged sustainable harvesting practices for tenrecs
   (Tenrec ecudatus) and pandans (Pandanus spp.). Unfortunately, the social
   norms concerning methods of harvesting pandans appeared to be breaking
   down in villages surrounding Ranomafana National Park, and we suggest
   that the imposition of external conservation rules is weakening
   traditional management. Informal institutions are important to
   conservation because they suggest ways of improving cultural
   understanding and conservation communication. Food taboos influence
   societal preferences, which affect the wider demand for a species. Most
   important, where capacity to enforce external conservation rules is
   limited, informal institutions may provide the only effective
   regulations. Informal institutions should receive greater attention from
   conservation biologists so that local people's conservation roles can be
   acknowledged fairly and so that potential synergies with conservation
   objectives can be realized.},

   SIGNALS},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-43},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships among the extant lemurid prosimians were
   assessed cladistically using stereotyped vocal, olfactory, and visual
   communication characters. Among our results are 3 findings of particular
   importance. First, our data are consistent with those from several
   recent studies of highly repeated DNA fragments in supporting a close
   phyletic affinity between Lemur catta and the genus Hapalemur. Moreover,
   our results indicate that L. catta is nested within the Hapalemur ur
   clade as the sister taxon to Hapalemur griseus/Hapalemur aureus. We
   interpret character states shared between Hapalemur simus and L. catta
   as primitive retentions by L. catta. Second, our findings agree with the
   DNA data in proposing a sister group relationship for Eulemur coronatus
   and Eulemur rubriventer. Third, our results question the validity of
   assigning Varecia variegata to the Lemuridae. For the characters we
   examined, Varecia more resembled indrids than lemurids, and the position
   of Varecia could be swapped with any of our outgroups (Indri,
   Propithecus, Daubentonia) without affecting tree topology. Previous
   workers sometimes have linked Varecia with various lemurids on grounds
   of ambiguously defined characters or on incorrect data gleaned from the
   literature. In those studies, the placement of Varecia in the Lemuridae
   usually has depended more on the minimization of character state
   conflicts (i.e. parsimony), than on demonstrable synapomorphies. In
   addition, data from DNA research have failed to demonstrate any pattern
   that links Varecia with Lemur; Hapalemur, or Eulemur. Results of the
   present study suggest that shared Varecia-indrid character states may be
   symplesiomorphic retentions in the Indridae, and that Varecia could be
   phyletically more primitive than either the indrids or lemurids.},

Title = {Headfirst descent behaviors in a comparative sample of strepsirrhine
   primates},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {83},
Number = {6, SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The ability to safely ascend and descend is critical to the success of
   arboreal animals. Nonprimate mammals typically descend supports
   headfirst aided by their claws, but primates must rely on grasping, and
   use a variety of behaviors to move down within an arboreal environment,
   including headfirst and tailfirst descending. This study assesses
   hypothesized body mass limits on vertical headfirst descent and
   identifies approximate support orientations and diameters at which
   headfirst descent is ceased in a sample of nine strepsirrhines species
   ranging in mass from 0.06 to 4.5 kg. Species under 1 kg, arboreal
   quadrupeds Cheirogaleus medius and Microcebus murinus, and slow climber
   Nycticebus pygmaeus, always descended supports headfirst regardless of
   orientation and diameter as long as a grasp could be established.
   Arboreal quadrupedal species above 1 kg, Daubetonia madagascariensis,
   Eulemur coronatus, Eulemur mongoz, Lemur catta, and Varecia variegata
   differed in the orientation at which they ceased using headfirst descent
   and the types of alternative descending behaviors they employed. Lemur
   catta, a highly terrestrial species, started to employ tailfirst
   descents at 45 degrees and completely stopped using headfirst descent on
   steeper and thicker supports. Other arboreal quadrupeds, D.
   madagascariensis, E. coronatus, E. mongoz, and V. variegata, began using
   tailfirst descent at 60 degrees. The vertical clinging and leaping
   species Propithecus coquereli rarely engaged in above branch
   quadrupedalism, and individuals were observed using tailfirst descents
   on supports as shallow as 15 degrees. This study shows the ways in which
   mass and anatomy may constrain use of headfirst descent through arboreal
   environments, and the alternate strategies strepsirrhine primates employ
   to descend.},

Title = {Minerals in the foods and diet of diademed sifakas: Are they nutritional
   challenges?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {79},
Number = {4, SI},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Minerals, though needed in small quantities, are essential to metabolic
   processes, and deficiencies can seriously threaten health, reproduction
   and survival. Despite this, few studies have measured mineral
   composition of wild primate foods and fewer have quantified mineral
   intake. Here we measured the concentration of nine minerals in 75 foods
   of diademed sifakas (Propithecus diadema; five groups) in habitats with
   varying levels of disturbance at Tsinjoarivo and estimated daily intakes
   using focal-animal feeding data and intake rates over one year. For six
   minerals (Ca, P, Na, Fe, Zn, and Cu), mean concentrations in foods fell
   short of the National Research Council's (NRC) recommendations for
   captive primates. Concentrations were highest in lianas, herbs, and
   epiphytes, and hemiparasites had exceptionally high Na. Leaves tended to
   have higher concentrations than fruits or flowers, but overlap was
   extensive. Mineral concentrations in daily diets varied little
   seasonally, but absolute intakes (g/day) were higher in the abundant
   season, due to the increase in food ingested. Disturbed habitat groups'
   diets had higher mineral concentrations for five minerals, but this
   translated into increased intakes only for Cu, as these groups ate less
   food overall. Overall, comparisons with percentage-based NRC
   recommendations suggests deficiencies, but this is contradicted by: (1)
   the fact that mass-specific intakes exceeded human recommendations, and
   (2) the lack of observed signs of deficiency. Ongoing efforts to
   quantify mineral consumption across wild primate populations and better
   understanding requirements on both a percentage and absolute basis will
   help in understanding effects on food selection, managing primate
   habitats and formulating captive diets.},

Title = {Anatomy is important, but need not be destiny: Novel uses of the thumb
   in aye-ayes compared to other lemurs},
Journal = {BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {231},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {378-385},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Aye-ayes (Daubentonia madagascerensis) have highly specialized hands
   with long digits, especially the thin middle one (D3), which is used for
   extracting food, such as beetle larvae, under bark. Due to the
   elongation of their fingers, including the thumb, it is presumed that
   aye-ayes have a rather limited capacity for delicate manipulation of
   objects. However, studies have reported independent movement of digits
   D3 and D4, and one report noted a seemingly independent thumb (D1)
   movement in holding food. Sixteen captive adult aye-ayes were videotaped
   feeding on a diverse range of foods so as to document how the thumb is
   used during food holding. To determine if the patterns observed were
   unique to aye-ayes, 24 individuals from 9 other species of lemurs were
   also videotaped. Two patterns of thumb use idiosyncratic to aye-ayes and
   one other lemur, the sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi), were identified:
   (1) when holding a food item in one hand, the thumb was used to secure
   the food, with the other digits playing a secondary role; (2) when
   holding a food item with both hands, the thumbs once again took a
   predominant role in securing the food. In the majority of these cases,

Title = {Cranial vault thickness in primates: Homo erectus does not have uniquely
   thick vault bones},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {120-134},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Extremely thick cranial vaults have been noted as a diagnostic
   characteristic of Homo erectus since the first fossil of the species was
   identified, but relatively little work has been done on elucidating its
   etiology or variation across fossils, living humans, or extant non-human
   primates. Cranial vault thickness (CVT) is not a monolithic trait, and
   the responsiveness of its layers to environmental stimuli is unknown.
   We obtained measurements of cranial vault thickness in fossil hominins
   from the literature and supplemented those data with additional
   measurements taken on African fossil specimens. Total CVT and the
   thickness of the cortical and diploe layers individually were compared
   to measures of CVT in extant species measured from more than 500 CT
   scans of human and non-human primates.
   Frontal and parietal CVT in fossil primates was compared to a regression
   of CVT on cranial capacity calculated for extant species. Even after
   controlling for cranial capacity, African and Asian H. erectus do not
   have uniquely high frontal or parietal thickness residuals, either among
   hominins or extant primates. Extant primates with residual CVT thickness
   similar to or exceeding H. erectus (depending on the sex and bone
   analyzed) include Nycticebus coucang, Perodicticus potto, Alouatta
   caraya, Lophocebus albigena, Galago alleni, Mandrillus sphinx, and
   Propithecus diadema. However, the especially thick vaults of extant
   non-human primates that overlap with H. erectus values are composed
   primarily of cortical bone, while H. erectus and other hominins have
   diploe-dominated vault bones. Thus, the combination of thick vaults
   comprised of a thickened diploe layer may be a reliable autapomorphy for
   members of the genus Homo. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The potential of occupancy modelling as a tool for monitoring wild
   primate populations},
Journal = {ANIMAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Pages = {457-465},

Abstract = {Primates are a global conservation priority, with half of known species
   considered threatened with extinction. Monitoring trends in primate
   populations is important for identifying species in particular need of
   conservation action, and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions.
   Most existing primate survey methods aim to measure abundance. However,
   obtaining estimates of abundance with acceptable precision to detect
   changes in population is often expensive and time consuming. Evidence
   from other taxa suggests that estimating occupancy (the proportion of
   the area used by the species) may be less resource-intensive, yet still
   provide useful information for monitoring population trends. We
   investigate the potential of occupancy modelling for monitoring forest
   primates using a case study of three species of diurnal lemurs in the
   eastern rainforest of Madagascar. We estimated detectability and
   occupancy from a survey with three visits to 30 sites. Our estimates
   suggest that precision in occupancy estimates would be maximized by
   visiting a larger number of sites (therefore with limited repeat visits)
   for Indri indri, whereas the optimal monitoring design for Eulemur
   fulvus and Propithecus diadema, which showed very low detectability in
   our surveys, involves more frequent visits to fewer sites. Power
   analyses suggested that a meaningful reduction in occupancy could be
   detected with reasonable effort for easily detected species, but the
   method may prove impractical for more cryptic species. Primates pose a
   number of practical challenges for occupancy modelling, including
   choosing appropriate survey designs to satisfy closure assumptions. We
   suggest that if these issues can be overcome, occupancy modelling has
   the potential to become a valuable addition to the monitoring toolbox
   for the study of forest primates.},

Title = {Variation in predicted COVID-19 risk among lemurs and lorises},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {83},
Number = {6, SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which in humans leads to the disease
   COVID-19, has caused global disruption and more than 2 million
   fatalities since it first emerged in late 2019. As we write, infection
   rates are at their highest point globally and are rising extremely
   rapidly in some areas due to more infectious variants. The primary
   target of SARS-CoV-2 is the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting
   enzyme-2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene predict that
   many nonhuman primates are also likely to be highly susceptible to
   infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order.
   Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid
   conservation, while others exhibit high variability at this locus. As an
   example of the latter, analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2 sequences
   to date indicate large variation among lemurs and lorises compared to
   other primate clades despite low sampling effort. Here, we report ACE2
   gene and protein sequences for 71 individual strepsirrhines, spanning 51
   species and 19 genera. Our study reinforces previous results while
   finding additional variability in other strepsirrhine species, and
   suggests several clades of lemurs have high potential susceptibility to
   SARS-CoV-2 infection. Troublingly, some species, including the rare and
   endangered aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), as well as those in
   the genera Avahi and Propithecus, may be at high risk. Given that lemurs
   are endemic to Madagascar and among the primates at highest risk of
   extinction globally, further understanding of the potential threat of
   COVID-19 to their health should be a conservation priority. All feasible
   actions should be taken to limit their exposure to SARS-CoV-2.},

Abstract = {Tannins, a type of plant secondary metabolite, are well-known for their
   ability to precipitate proteins and thereby reduce the protein available
   to consumers. Most primate studies have focused on condensed tannins
   (CTs) as they were thought to be the most effective type of tannin at
   preventing protein acquisition, but there is growing recognition that
   other types of tannins can bind to proteins, suggesting the division
   among tannin types is not as clear-cut as previously thought. Although
   previous studies have documented the presence of CTs in primate diets
   and primates' behavioral responses to them, our understanding of tannins
   remains limited because few researchers have used Sephadex column
   purification to accurately determine tannin concentrations, and few have
   used in vitro assays to determine available protein content and the
   tannins' effectiveness in binding protein. In this study, we documented
   diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema) diet from June to August 2018 at
   Tsinjoarivo, Madagascar (in two forests with varying degrees of habitat
   disturbance) and quantified CT concentration and actual available
   protein in foods. Eleven of the fourteen top foods tested contained CTs
   (concentrations: 4.8\%-39.3\% dry matter). An in vitro assay showed
   available protein was strikingly low in six of the eleven top foods
   (e.g., little to no apparent available protein, despite high crude
   protein). Overall, our findings suggest sifakas acquire less protein
   than previously recognized and probably have adaptations to counteract
   tannins. Such studies of available protein are critical in understanding
   dietary constraints on sifaka populations and the evolution of their
   diet choice strategies; despite the conventional wisdom that leaves are
   protein-rich, folivorous primates may indeed be protein-limited.
   However, further studies are necessary to determine if sifakas have
   counter-adaptations to tannins, and if they absorb more protein than our
   analyses suggest, perhaps receiving protein that we were unable to
   detect with the current techniques (e.g., pollen).},

Abstract = {Bacterial communities colonizing the reproductive tracts of primates
   (including humans) impact the health, survival and fitness of the host,
   and thereby the evolution of the host species. Despite their importance,
   we currently have a poor understanding of primate microbiomes. The
   composition and structure of microbial communities vary considerably
   depending on the host and environmental factors. We conducted
   comparative analyses of the primate vaginal microbiome using
   pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA genes of a phylogenetically broad range
   of primates to test for factors affecting the diversity of primate
   vaginal ecosystems. The nine primate species included: humans (Homo
   sapiens), yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus), olive baboons (Papio
   anubis), lemurs (Propithecus diadema), howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra),
   red colobus (Piliocolobus rufomitratus), vervets (Chlorocebus aethiops),
   mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Our
   results indicated that all primates exhibited host-specific vaginal
   microbiota and that humans were distinct from other primates in both
   microbiome composition and diversity. In contrast to the gut microbiome,
   the vaginal microbiome showed limited congruence with host phylogeny,
   and neither captivity nor diet elicited substantial effects on the
   vaginal microbiomes of primates. Permutational multivariate analysis of
   variance and Wilcoxon tests revealed correlations among vaginal
   microbiota and host species-specific socioecological factors,
   particularly related to sexuality, including: female promiscuity,
   baculum length, gestation time, mating group size and neonatal birth
   weight. The proportion of unclassified taxa observed in nonhuman primate
   samples increased with phylogenetic distance from humans, indicative of
   the existence of previously unrecognized microbial taxa. These findings
   contribute to our understanding of host-microbe variation and
   coevolution, microbial biogeography, and disease risk, and have
   important implications for the use of animal models in studies of human
   sexual and reproductive diseases.},

Title = {Forest Fragments, Lemur Communities and Local Perception of Nature in a
   Protected Area of Northwestern Madagascar},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 24},
Abstract = {Biological conservation projects conducted in inhabited areas are often
   based on the combination of ecological diagnostics and study of
   practices and use of the environment by local communities. They less
   frequently integrate the influence of the perception and representation
   of nature on these practices, while these should also be taken into
   account in the initiation of sustainable conservation actions. We
   carried out a long-term study combining biological and social science
   approaches in North-western Madagascar in the Antrema protected area
   (with dry forest/savannah/coastal ecosystems), including an analysis of
   the use and perception of nature by its inhabitants. Together with the
   study of tree diversity, forest structure and biomass in 7 forest
   fragments, we estimated population densities of whole communities of
   diurnal and nocturnal lemurs, one of which is considered sacred. We
   interviewed local resource users from several villages using classical
   methods of social anthropology supplemented with perception tests
   derived from sensory evaluation methods. The structure of forest
   fragments as well as their basal area and richness in tree species
   varied with human pressure on specific plants (timber extraction) or
   with historical changes in pasture management (forest regrowth). Lemurs
   were generally abundant, with a high total biomass compared to other dry
   forests. Although the inhabitants of Antrema (Sakalava, Tsimihety, and
   Betsileo) still strongly adhered to local use rights and shared deeply
   rooted knowledge about the forest, the use and perception of nature
   (e.g., regarding the sacred lemur Propithecus coronatus) have changed
   since the Antrema protection project in 2000. The results suggest that
   local communities tend to integrate traditional rules about nature with
   international environmental regulation, perhaps a sign of a new
   ecological awareness. However, in the new management mode accompanying
   this transition, it can also be a means of local empowerment that takes
   advantage of a program supporting pro-environmental management of the
   Antrema area.},

Title = {Eulerian videography technology improves classification of sleep
   architecture in primates},
Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {60},
Number = {5},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Sleep is a critically important dimension of primate behavior, ecology,
   and evolution, yet primate sleep is under-studied because current
   methods of analyzing sleep are expensive, invasive, and time-consuming.
   In contrast to electroencephalography (EEG) and actigraphy, videography
   is a cost-effective and non-invasive method to study sleep architecture
   in animals. With video data, however, it is challenging to score subtle
   changes that occur in different sleep states, and technology has lagged
   behind innovations in EEG and actigraphy. Here, we applied Eulerian
   videography to magnify pixels relevant to scoring sleep from video, and
   then compared these results to analyses based on actigraphy and standard
   infrared videography. We studied four species of lemurs (Eulemur
   coronatus, Lemur catta, Propithecus coquereli, Varecia rubra) for 12-h
   periods per night, resulting in 6480 1-min epochs for analysis. Cramer's
   V correlation between actigraphy-classified sleep and infrared
   videography-classified sleep revealed consistent results in eight of the
   nine 12-h videos scored. A sample of the infrared videography was then
   processed by Eulerian videography for movement magnification and
   re-coded. A second Cramer's V correlation analysis, between two
   independent scorers coding the same Eulerian-processed video, found that
   interobserver agreement among Eulerian videography increased sleep vs.
   awake, NREM, and REM classifications by 7.1\%, 46.7\%, and 34.3\%,
   respectively. Furthermore, Eulerian videography was more strongly
   correlated with actigraphy data when compared to results from standard
   infrared videography. The increase in agreement between the two scorers
   indicates that Eulerian videography has the potential to improve the
   identification of sleep states in lemurs and other primates, and thus to
   expand our understanding of sleep architecture without the need for EEG.},

Abstract = {The structures of milk oligosaccharides were characterized for four
   strepsirrhine primates to examine the extent to which they resemble milk
   oligosaccharides in other primates. Neutral and acidic oligosaccharides
   were isolated from milk of the greater galago (Galagidae: Otolemur
   crassicaudatus), aye-aye (Daubentoniidae: Daubentonia madagascariensis),
   Coquerel's sifaka (Indriidae: Propithecus coquereli) and mongoose lemur
   (Lemuridae: Eulemur mongoz), and their chemical structures were
   characterized by H-1-NMR spectroscopy. The oligosaccharide patterns
   observed among strepsirrhines did not appear to correlate to phylogeny,
   sociality or pattern of infant care. Both type I and type II neutral
   oligosaccharides were found in the milk of the aye-aye, but type II
   predominate over type I. Only type II oligosaccharides were identified
   in other strepsirrhine milks. alpha 3'-GL (isoglobotriose, Gal(alpha
   1-3)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc) was found in the milks of Coquerel's sifaka and
   mongoose lemur, which is the first report of this oligosaccharide in the
   milk of any primate species. 2'-FL (Fuc(alpha 1-2)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc) was
   found in the milk of an aye-aye with an ill infant. Oligosaccharides
   containing the Lewis x epitope were found in aye-aye and mongoose lemur
   milk. Among acidic oligosaccharides, 3'-N-acetylneuraminyllactose
   (3'-SL-NAc, Neu5Ac(alpha 2-3)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc) was found in all studied
   species, whereas 6'-N-acetylneuraminyllactose (6'-SL-NAc, Neu5Ac(alpha
   2-6)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc) was found in all species except greater galago.
   Greater galago milk also contained 3'-N-glycolylneuraminyllactose
   (3'-SL-NGc, Neu5Gc(alpha 2-3)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc). The finding of a variety
   of neutral and acidic oligosaccharides in the milks of strepsirrhines,
   as previously reported for haplorhines, suggests that such constituents
   are ancient rather than derived features, and are as characteristic of
   primate lactation is the classic disaccharide, lactose.},

Title = {Logical inferences from visual and auditory information in ruffed lemurs
   and sifakas},

Abstract = {Inference by exclusion, or the ability to select a correct course of
   action by systematically excluding other potential alternatives, is a
   form of logical inference that allows individuals to solve problems
   without complete information. Current comparative research shows that
   several bird, mammal and primate species can find hidden food through
   inference by exclusion. Yet there is also wide variation in how
   successful different species are as well as the kinds of sensory
   information they can use to do so. An important question is therefore
   why some species are better at engaging in logical inference than
   others. Here, we investigate the evolution of logical reasoning
   abilities by comparing strepsirrhine primate species that vary in
   dietary ecology: frugivorous ruffed lemurs (Varecia spp.) and folivorous
   Coquerel's sifakas, Propithecus coquereli. Across two studies, we
   examined their abilities to locate food using direct information versus
   inference from exclusion and using both visual and auditory information.
   In study 1, we assessed whether these lemurs could make inferences when
   full visual and auditory information about the two potential locations
   of food were provided. In study 2, we then compared their ability to
   make direct inferences versus inferences by exclusion in both the visual
   and auditory domains. We found that these lemur species can use visual
   information to find food, but that only ruffed lemurs were also able to
   use auditory cues, mirroring differences in the complexity of their wild
   ecology. We further found that, unlike many anthropoid species tested to
   date, these strepsirrhine species failed to make inferences by
   exclusion. These results highlight the importance of natural history in
   understanding the evolution of logical inference and help reconstruct
   the deeper phylogeny of primate cognition. (c) 2020 The Association for

Title = {Single-limb force data for two lemur species while vertically clinging},

Volume = {158},

Abstract = {ObjectivesVertical clinging and climbing have been integral to
   hypotheses about primate origins, yet little is known about how an
   animal with nails instead of claws resists gravity while on large,
   vertical, and cylindrical substrates. Here we test models of how force
   is applied to maintain posture, predicting (1) the shear component force
   (F-s) at the hands will be higher than the feet; (2) the normal
   component force (F-n) at the feet will be relatively high compared to
   the hands; (3) the component force resisting gravity (F-g) at the feet
   will be relatively high compared to the hands; (4) species with a high
   frequency of vertical clinging postures will have low F-g at the hands
   due to relatively short forelimbs.
   Materials and MethodsUsing a novel instrumented support, single-limb
   force data were collected during clinging postures for the hands and
   feet and compared across limbs and species for Propithecus verreauxi
   (N=2), a habitual vertical clinger and leaper, and Varecia variegata
   (N=3), a habitual above-branch arboreal quadruped.
   ResultsFor both species, hand F-s were significantly higher than at the
   feet and F-n and F-g at the feet were significantly higher than at the
   hands. Between species, P. verreauxi has relatively low F-g at the hands
   and F-n at the feet than V. vareigata.
   DiscussionThese results support previous models and show that hindlimb
   loading dominance, characteristic of primate locomotion, is found during
   clinging behaviors and may allow the forelimbs to be used for foraging
   while clinging. These findings provide insight into selective pressures
   on force distribution in primates and primate locomotor evolution. Am J

Abstract = {This chapter deals with the adaptation of taste responses of lemurs and
   other primates to different environments, in relation to primary and
   secondary compounds in potential foodstuffs. Emphasis is placed on the
   relationship between taste sensibility to sugars and energy expenditure
   across species. In the most specialized species, the adaptive trends are
   inferred according to the importance of the deviation from such
   allometric relationship. The signification of sugar mimics present in
   some fruits is discussed in terms of coevolution of plants and tasting
   ability of primates, that, for lemurs, parallels that of platyrrhine
   monkeys.
   Taste responses towards other tastants such as sodium chloride are
   examined in relation to potential risks of deficiency and/or toxicity.
   Sensitivity to tannins has been investigated in different species, with
   a two-bottle preference test. We observed large variations that are
   likely to be adaptive to the concentrations in plant species in various
   environments. For instance, the rejection threshold for a mixture of
   tannin and fructose is much higher in Propithecus verreauxi (above 170
   g/l) than in Microcebus murinus (0.54 g/l). Recognition thresholds can
   also vary slightly between human populations, in relation to ancient or
   recent food practices. There is also a wide range of taste sensitivity
   towards quinine, without any correlation, in this case, with body mass
   or other factors related to energy expenditure.
   Different habitats of Madagascar are compared according to the results
   of screening tests on tannins and alkaloids. The eastern rain forest (at
   Andasibe) present slightly lower proportion of plants with alkaloid-like
   reaction, and a significantly higher proportion of tannin-rich plants
   than both the gallery forest and the Didiereaceae bush in the south (at
   Berenty. The results have been related to the gustatory ability of lemur
   species having to cope with these secondary compounds, and the food
   niche of the different species.},

Title = {Museum collections are the key to studying lemurs' diet:
   gastrointestinal morphology of Cheirogaleus major},
Journal = {SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {483-487},
Abstract = {This study reports the first description of the gastrointestinal (GIT)
   morphology of a lemur species (Cheirogaleus major E. Geoffroy, 1812) of
   the family Cheirogaleidae using a museum collection deposited at the
   Natural History Museum, London. Knowledge on GIT morphology is the key
   to assessment of the diet of animals, especially those that are highly
   threatened. Several studies predicted the demise of lemurs (>100 species
   representing 20\% of the world's primate diversity) by 2080 unless the
   conservation community acts quickly. In this context, museum collections
   could provide valuable evidence on the biology of lemurs to underpin
   conservation protocols. The feeding ecology of the omnivorous
   Cheirogaleus major is poorly known due to its secretive periods of
   hibernation and daily torpor, nocturnal activity and solitary foraging
   habit. To better understand the biology of C. major, we described and
   compared its GIT morphology with those of six other species for which we
   have published data, especially the frugivore taxa (Eulemur coronatus
   Grey, 1842 and Varecia variegata Kerr, 1792). Our findings showed that
   C. major has a GIT morphology similar to those of E. coronatus and V.
   variegata. This is especially the case because of its caecum, which is
   short and only slightly sacculated suggesting that it is not suitable
   for microbial breakdown of plant cell wall (unlike those of Propithecus
   species, Lemur catta, and Hapalemur griseus). This result is in line
   with ecological studies suggesting that C. major obtains its protein and
   carbohydrate intake from fruits and to some extent arthropods and not
   from the digestion of leaves as previously hypothesized. In light of
   this new evidence, conservation programmes should account for both the
   lemur and its associated flora. Overall, this study demonstrates the
   unique potential of museum collections to study the nutritional ecology
   of threatened animals and their potential role in supporting
   conservation.},

Title = {Activity patterns in seven captive lemur species: Evidence of
   cathemerality in Varecia and Lemur catta?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {79},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Cathemerality, or activity throughout the 24-hr cycle, is rare in
   primates yet relatively common among lemurs. However, the diverse
   ecological conditions under which cathemerality is expressed complicates
   attempts to identify species-typical behavior. For example, Lemur catta
   and Varecia have historically been described as diurnal, yet recent
   studies suggest that they might exhibit cathemeral behavior under some
   conditions. To investigate this variation, we monitored activity
   patterns among lemurs that are exposed to similar captive environments.
   Using MotionWatch 8 (R) actigraphy data loggers, we studied 88 lemurs
   across seven species at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC). Six species were
   members of the family Lemuridae (Eulemur coronatus, E. flavifrons, E.
   mongoz, L. catta, V. rubra, V. variegata), while a seventh was strictly
   diurnal and included as an out-group (Propithecus coquereli). For each
   24-hr cycle (N = 503), we generated two estimates of cathemerality: mean
   night (MN) activity and day/night (DN) activity ratio (day and night
   cutoffs were based on astronomical twilights). As expected, P. coquereli
   engaged in the least amount of nocturnal activity according to both
   measures; their activity was also outside the 95\% confidence intervals
   of all three cathemeral Eulemur species, which exhibited the greatest
   evidence of cathemerality. By these estimates, Varecia activity was most
   similar to Eulemur and exhibited substantial deviations from P.
   coquereli (beta (MN) = 0.22 +/- SE 0.12; beta (DN) = -0.21 +/- SE 0.12).
   L. catta activity patterns also deviated from P. coquereli (beta (MN) =
   0.12 +/- SE 0.11; beta (DN) = -0.15 +/- SE 0.12) but to a lesser degree
   than either Varecia or Eulemur. Overall, L. catta displayed an
   intermediate activity pattern between Eulemur and P. coquereli, which is
   somewhat consistent with wild studies. Regarding Varecia, although
   additional observations in more diverse wild habitats are needed, our
   findings support the existence of cathemeral behavior in this genus.},

   PRIMATES},

Year = {1991},
Volume = {86},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The geometry of the midshaft cross-sections of the femur and humerus of
   five indriid species was analysed.  Internal (marrow cavity) and
   external diameters were measured on X-rays in the anteroposterior (a-p)
   and mediolateral (m-l) planes; cross-sectional areas, second moments of
   area, and section moduli were calculated using formulae for a hollow
   ellipse.  Cortical thickness, robusticity indices (relating external
   diameters to the length of the bones), and a-p/m-l shape variables were
   also calculated.  Model II regression was supplemented by analyses of
   correlation between size and shape.  Indriids are saltatory, i.e., their
   locomotion is dominated by the hind limbs.  Accordingly, the femur is
   more rigid than the humerus, and it shows a consistent difference
   between the a-p and m-l planes in measures related to bending strength. 
   Cortical thickness varies considerably both within and across species. 
   The type specimen of the new species Propithecus tattersalli is
   virtually indistinguishable from P. verreauxi on the basis of its long
   bone cross-sectional geometry.  Femoral robusticity is uncorrelated with
   size, but humeral robusticity decreases significantly with increasing
   size.  Femoral shape variables (a-p/m-l) are all negatively correlated
   with body size, indicating that m-l dimensions of the femur increase at
   a faster rate than do a-p dimensions.  The highly loaded plane of
   movement seems to be more reinforced in the smaller species.  Contrary
   to static biomechanical scaling predictions of positive allometry, all
   cross-sectional parameters scale relatively close to isometry.  It is
   concluded that either changes in locomotor performance must compensate
   for the weight-related increase in forces and moments or that the
   larger-bodied animals operate appreciably closer to the limits of their
   safety margins.},

Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {Determining what factors affect species occurrence is vital to the study
   of primate biogeography. We investigated the metapopulation dynamics of
   a lemur community consisting of eight species (Avahi occidentalis,
   Propithecus coquereli, Microcebus murinus, Microcebus ravelobensis,
   Lepilemur edwardsi, Cheirogaleus medius, Eulemur mongoz, and Eulemur
   fulvus) within fragmented tropical dry deciduous forest habitat in
   Ankarafantsika National Park, Madagascar. We measured fragment size and
   isolation of 42 fragments of forest ranging in size from 0.23 to 117.7
   ha adjacent to continuous forest. Between June and November 2011, we
   conducted 1218 surveys and observed six of eight lemur species (M.
   murinus, M. ravelobensis, C. medius, E. fulvus, P. coquereli, and L.
   edwardsi) in the 42 fragments. We applied among patch incidence function
   models (IFMs) with various measures of dispersal and a mainland-island
   IFM to lemur species occurrence, with the aim of answering the following
   questions: 1) Do lemur species in dry deciduous forest fragments form
   metapopulations? 2) What are the separate effects of area (extinction
   risk) and connectivity/isolation (colonization potential) within a lemur
   metapopulation? 3) Within simulated metapopulations over time, how do
   area and connectivity/isolation affect occurrence? and 4) What are the
   conservation implications of our findings? We found that M. murinus
   formed either a mainland-island or an among patch metapopulation, M.
   ravelobensis formed a mainland-island metapopulation, C. medius and E.
   fulvus formed among patch metapopulations, and neither P. coquereli or
   L. edwardsi formed a metapopulation. Metapopulation dynamics and
   simulations suggest that area was a more consistent positive factor
   determining lemur species occurrence than fragment isolation and is
   crucial to the maintenance of lemur populations within this fragmented
   landscape. Using a metapopulation approach to lemur biogeography is
   critical for understanding how lemur species respond to forest loss and
   fragmentation.},

Title = {The socio-matrix reloaded: from hierarchy to dominance profile in wild
   lemurs},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Dominance hierarchy influences the life quality of social animals, and
   its definition should in principle be based on the outcome of agonistic
   interactions. However, defining and comparing the dominance profile of
   social groups is difficult due to the different dominance measures used
   and because no one measure explains it all. We applied different
   analytical methods to winner-loser sociomatrices to determine the
   dominance profile of five groups of wild lemurs (species: Lemur catta,
   Propithecus verreauxi, and Eulemur rufus x collaris) from the Berenty
   forest (Madagascar). They are an excellent study model because they
   share the same habitat and an apparently similar dominance profile:
   linear hierarchy and female dominance. Data were collected over more
   than 1200 h of observation. Our approach included four steps: (1) by
   applying the binary dyadic dominance relationship method (I\&SI) on
   either aggressions or supplant sociomatrices we verified whether
   hierarchy was aggression or submission based; (2) by calculating
   normalized David's scores and measuring steepness from aggression
   sociomatrices we evaluated whether hierarchy was shallow or steep; (3)
   by comparing the ranking orders obtained with methods 1 and 2 we
   assessed whether hierarchy was consistent or not; and (4) by assessing
   triangle transitivity and comparing it with the linearity index and the
   level of group cohesion we determined if hierarchy was more or less
   cohesive. Our results show that L. catta groups have got a steep,
   consistent, highly transitive and cohesive hierarchy. P. verreauxi
   groups are characterized by a moderately steep and consistent hierarchy,
   with variable levels of triangle transitivity and cohesion. E. rufus x
   collaris group possesses a shallow and inconsistent hierarchy, with
   lower (but not lowest) levels of transitivity and cohesion. A multiple
   analytical approach on winner-loser sociomatrices other than leading to
   an in-depth description of the dominance profile, allows intergroup and
   cross-species comparisons.},

Title = {Diurnality and nocturnality in nonhuman primates: comparative
   chronobiological studies in laboratory and nature},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {229-267},
Abstract = {Looking for differences in circadian clock characteristics of diurnal
   and nocturnal nonhuman primates, this article summarizes results of
   chronobiological studies carried out in various nocturnal, diurnal, and
   cathemeral prosimian and anthropoid primate species under controlled
   laboratory conditions, under seminatural conditions, and in the wild. In
   almost all circadian parameters investigated, no differences were
   discernible between the two main chrono-ecotypes, either in circadian
   period length and the influence upon it of after-effects, of light
   intensity, and ambient temperature, or in the PRC, re-entrainment
   behavior, rhythm splitting, and internal desynchronization. Diurnal and
   nocturnal or cathemeral species differed only in the phase of artificial
   or natural LDs to which their circadian activity phase was adjusted as
   well as in the characteristics of masking activity upon the rhythms
   produced by the direct inhibiting or enhancing effects of light.
   Pronounced lunar periodicity - observed in the activity rhythm of
   nocturnal neotropical owl monkeys, genus Aotus, in seminatural and
   natural environments as well as in wild cathemeral Malagasy lemurs,
   genus Eulemur - is shown to result from masking effects of moonlight. In
   captive Eulemur fulvus albifrons, a change from dark-active over
   cathemeral to light-active behavior, without concurrently changing the
   circadian phase-setting of activity to D, was produced by direct masking
   effects of a stepwise reduction of darktime luminosity on an LD 12:12
   cycle. Long-term activity recordings carried out in wild diurnal
   Malagasy sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) and cathemeral redfronted
   lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus), as well as in wild nocturnal owl monkeys
   (Aotus a. azarai) of the North Argentinean Chaco, yielded in all species
   distinct bimodal long- and short-day activity patterns with pronounced
   peaks during dusk and dawn. Applying Pittendrigh's two-oscillator
   concept to these results, it is hypothesized that the differences in
   chrono-ecotype behavior may result from variations in internal coupling
   and external phase-setting of morning and evening oscillators (m, e) to
   dawn and dusk, interacting with direct masking effects of light.},

Title = {Sight or Scent: Lemur Sensory Reliance in Detecting Food Quality Varies
   with Feeding Ecology},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 3},
Abstract = {Visual and olfactory cues provide important information to foragers, yet
   we know little about species differences in sensory reliance during food
   selection. In a series of experimental foraging studies, we examined the
   relative reliance on vision versus olfaction in three diurnal, primate
   species with diverse feeding ecologies, including folivorous Coquerel's
   sifakas (Propithecus coquereli), frugivorous ruffed lemurs (Varecia
   variegata spp), and generalist ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). We used
   animals with known color-vision status and foods for which different
   maturation stages (and hence quality) produce distinct visual and
   olfactory cues (the latter determined chemically). We first showed that
   lemurs preferentially selected high-quality foods over low-quality foods
   when visual and olfactory cues were simultaneously available for both
   food types. Next, using a novel apparatus in a series of discrimination
   trials, we either manipulated food quality (while holding sensory cues
   constant) or manipulated sensory cues (while holding food quality
   constant). Among our study subjects that showed relatively strong
   preferences for high-quality foods, folivores required both sensory cues
   combined to reliably identify their preferred foods, whereas generalists
   could identify their preferred foods using either cue alone, and
   frugivores could identify their preferred foods using olfactory, but not
   visual, cues alone. Moreover, when only high-quality foods were
   available, folivores and generalists used visual rather than olfactory
   cues to select food, whereas frugivores used both cue types equally.
   Lastly, individuals in all three of the study species predominantly
   relied on sight when choosing between low-quality foods, but species
   differed in the strength of their sensory biases. Our results generally
   emphasize visual over olfactory reliance in foraging lemurs, but we
   suggest that the relative sensory reliance of animals may vary with
   their feeding ecology.},

Title = {Characterizing gastrointestinal transit time in four lemur species using

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Differences in dietary profiles and gastrointestinal (GI) morphologies
   observed across lemur species suggest that there may be variation in
   patterns of digesta flow through the GI tract related to the method of
   digesta processing. Using radio-opaque barium-impregnated polyethylene
   spheres (BIPS), we characterized such patterns in four lemur species:
   Varecia variegata (VV), Eulemur fulvus (EF), Propithecus verreauxi (PV),
   and Hapalemur griseus (HG) (n=2 per species). After an initial
   radiograph was taken under light sedation, the animals were fed the BIPS
   together with a small meal. A combination of 30 small (1.5 mm) and 10
   large (5 mm) BIPS was administered. Radiographs were then taken on a
   species-dependent basis up to 48 hr post-dosage. For small BIPS, the
   gastric transit time (GTT; time of first exit of BIPS from stomach) was
   0.25-2 hr for VV, EF, and HG, and approximately 10 hr for PV. The
   oro-rectal transit time (ORTT; time of first appearance in the rectum)
   was <2 hr for VV and EF, and 24.0 hr for PV and HG. The intestinal
   transit time (ITT, measured as ORTT - GTT) was <1.5 hr for VV and EF,
   and approximately 14 hr and 22 hr for PV and HG, respectively. These
   data suggest that the GTT of digesta as measured with BIPS was rapid for
   VV, EF, and HG. For VV and EF, the ORTT and ITT were also rapid, while
   for HG they were much slower. PV was characterized by delayed GTT, and a
   more rapid ITT compared to HG. Thus, patterns of flow for PV and HG,
   despite similar ORTT, differed in that HG emptied BIPS more rapidly and
   ITT was slower. The flow of BIPS did not differ for VV and EF. These
   data reveal new information in addition to the total tract transit time,
   and complement existing knowledge regarding anatomy and diet. (C) 2004

Title = {Female Power: A New Framework for Understanding ``Female Dominance{''}
   in Lemurs},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},
Number = {1},
Pages = {48-68},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Female dominance is often associated with lemurs. However, consensus
   does not exist among primatologists on how to define, measure, or
   explain female dominance. This review explores the utility of applying a
   broader concept of power to understanding lemur intersexual
   relationships. In this framework, power is defined as arising from an
   asymmetry in a dyadic relationship and can be divided into 2 types:
   dominance and leverage. Intersexual asymmetries based upon females
   having superior fighting ability are considered female dominance.
   However, economic power also exists, and females with resource-based
   power exhibit female leverage. Additionally, power has 4 characteristics
   (base, means, amount, and scope) that describe the precise nature of
   observed phenomena. This article utilizes the 4 characteristics outlined
   in the power framework to review the existing ``female dominance{''}
   literature for lemurs and highlights the value of adopting both an
   expanded concept of power and a more precise language. By placing the
   multiple phenomena currently labeled under the single term ``female
   dominance{''} within the power framework, much of the confusion
   disappears. Thus, not only is the debate reframed, facilitating
   endeavors to find evolutionary explanations, but the uniqueness of
   female power in lemurs can be determined empirically rather than by
   definition.},

   D1's time in 1998 was spent in the 1975 home range, and 52\% of their
   scent marks were placed in that 1975 home range. The remainder of their
   time was spent in an extension of their home range, which is now an area
   of confrontation with an adjacent troop. They used the same sleeping
   trees in the 2 years, and all of the 1998 scent marks deposited in the
   1975 home range were place in the same locations marked in 1975. The

Title = {FIELD ANESTHESIA OF WILD RING-TAILED LEMURS (LEMUR CATTA) USING

Abstract = {Telazol (R) has been commonly used for field anesthesia of wild lemurs,
   including ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). Telazol alone provides good
   induction, but doesn't cause adequate muscle relaxation and sedation for
   collecting consistent somatic measurements and high-quality dental
   impressions that are sometimes needed. Variability in induction response
   has been seen between individuals that have received similar dosages,
   with young lemurs seeming to need more anesthetic than mature lemurs.
   This investigation evaluated Telazol induction in young (2.0-4.9 yr) and
   mature (>= 5.0 yr) ring-tailed lemurs and compared postinduction
   supplementation with medetomidine or medetomidine-butorphanol.
   Forty-eight lemurs were anesthetized with Telazol administered via blow
   dart; then, 20 min after darting, they were supplemented via hand
   injection with either medetomidine (0.04 mg/kg) or medetomidine
   butorphanol (0.04 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively). The odds ratio for
   young lemurs to need more than one dart for induction, relative to
   mature lemurs, was 3.8, even though the initial dose of Telazol received
   by young lemurs (19 +/- 7 mg/kg) was significantly higher than the
   initial dose administered to mature lemurs (12 +/- 5 mg/kg). The total
   Telazol dosage was also significantly different between young lemurs (33
   +/- 15 mg/kg) and mature lemurs (18 +/- 9 mg/kg). Both medetomidine and
   medetomidinc butorphanol provided good muscle relaxation and sedation
   for all procedures. Physiologic values were similar between the two
   protocols. Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was generally good,
   although there were a few SaO(2) values < 90\%. Recoveries were smooth,
   but long. Time to head up was correlated with total Telazol dosage in
   mature lemurs. In young lemurs, time to standing was correlated with
   Telazol induction dosage and time of last Telazol administration. Lemurs
   that received hand injections of Telazol took longer to recover than
   those that did not. Further refinements are needed to increase induction
   reliability and to decrease recovery time, particularly in young lemurs.},

Abstract = {Collective movements are essential for maintaining group cohesion.
   However, group members can have different optimal departure times,
   depending on individual, social and contextual factors whose relative
   importance remains poorly known. We, therefore, studied collective
   departures in four groups of red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) in
   Kirindy Forest, Madagascar, to investigate the influence of an
   individual's age, sex, their affiliative relationships and their
   proximity to other group members at the time of departure on their
   individual departure decision. We recorded behavioural and spatial data
   on individual departures during 167 group movements and conducted group
   scans (181-279 per group) to assess affiliative relationships. All
   factors influenced individual departures. Both affiliation and proximity
   determined a mimetic joining process in which dyads with stronger
   affiliative bonds departed in closer succession, and individuals
   followed the initiator and predecessors more quickly when they were in
   closer proximity at departure. While the influence of affiliation is
   common, the effect of inter-individual distance has rarely been
   considered in groups with heterogeneous social relationships. Although
   local rules influenced joining, the overall movement pattern was mainly
   determined by individual traits: juveniles took protected central
   positions, while females made up the van and males brought up the rear.
   Individual needs, expressed in the departure order, to an extent
   overruled the effect of affiliation. These results highlight the
   importance of considering individual, social and contextual factors
   collectively in the study of collective movements.},

Title = {To follow or not to follow: decision making and leadership during the

Year = {2008},
Volume = {75},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {To benefit from group living, group members need to keep the group
   cohesive by coordinating time and direction of travelling.
   Self-organization and leadership are two means of coordination and two
   types of decision can be made on the group level: combined and
   consensus. We studied the initiation process of group movements during
   the morning departure of a group of chacma baboons, Papio hamadryas
   ursinus, from its sleeping site in De Hoop Nature Reserve, South Africa.
   Findings from other female-bonded primate groups led us to hypothesize
   that females should play a major role in the decision-making process.
   Approximately 75\% of the adults made a start attempt, with 62 of 92
   attempts being by males. There was no sex difference in the probability
   of being successful when initiating an attempt. Lactating females
   initiated fewer than pregnant or cycling females. Thus, at least for
   this group of chacma baboons, leadership appeared to be distributed and
   the decision about the timing of departure and travel direction seemed
   to be a partially shared consensus decision with adult males
   contributing more to the decision outcome, with a slightly more
   prominent role of the dominant male. Our results do not support the
   `leading females' hypothesis. No behavioural patterns that might serve
   as specialized signals leading to a more successful recruitment of other
   group members were observed. The departure process appeared to be
   coordinated merely through individuals setting an example by moving off.

Abstract = {Knowledge of armadillo reproductive physiology is essential for
   developing ex situ and in situ assisted reproductive techniques for
   propagating and/or controlling populations of these animals. The present
   study included assessment of fecal sex steroids by radioimmunoassay,
   determining reproductive status via monitoring ovarian activity (in the
   wild) and therefore reproductive status, in wild females of the large
   hairy armadillo (Chaetophractus villosus) and the crying armadillo
   (Chaetophractus vellerosus) in the southern hemisphere. Plasma and fresh
   fecal progesterone concentrations were not significantly correlated in
   either species. However, in both species, there was a significant
   positive correlation between plasma progesterone and dry fecal
   progesterone concentrations (r = 0.82, P < 0.05 and r = 0.60, P < 0.05,
   respectively). Dry fecal progesterone and estradiol concentrations were
   measured in one captive C. villosus (average baseline progesterone and
   estradiol concentrations 28.72 +/- 11.75 ng/g dry feces and 3.04 +/-
   0.80 ng/g dry feces, respectively) and one captive C. vellerosus
   (average baseline progesterone and estradiol concentrations 14.05 +/-
   3.03 ng/g dry feces and 3.46 +/- 1.20 ng/g dry feces, respectively) to
   detect hormonal peaks over 1 y; these occurred from late fall to early
   summer. Feces from wild C. villosus and C. vellerosus were also
   collected over 1 y to determine progesterone peaks, which occurred in
   winter and spring in both species (with no peaks during the summer or
   fall). Accordingly, C. villosus and C. vellerosus had a seasonal
   reproductive pattern. The significant correlations between dry fecal and
   plasma progesterone concentrations validated this method for monitoring
   reproductive status in these species. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The climate of western Madagascar is characterized by a long ( 8 - 9 mo)
   dry season during which small rivers run dry, so that most animals are
   dependent on access to a few permanent water holes. We studied the
   effects of water scarcity at the end of the dry season on the ranging
   behavior of 4 groups of redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus) living
   at different distances from the Kirindy Riverbed in the Kirindy/CFPF
   forest northeast of Morondava. Using radio-collars, we located 2
   resident groups with permanent home ranges near the river, and 2
   non-resident groups and followed them for 60 days. We obtained a GPS
   reading every 30 min and later analyzed them with GIS ArcView to
   determine the size and location of each group's ( core) home range. One
   group resided in direct proximity to the riverbed with several water
   holes and made regular short trips ( mean 330 m) to drink. A second
   resident group had no direct access to water and made regular trips to
   the same water hole at a mean distance of 590 m from their home range.
   One non-resident group had a center of activity about 1300 m from the
   nearest water hole, to which they traveled on a non-daily basis. The
   other non-resident group established a temporary binuclear home range
   with one center of activity near the riverbed, about 2900 m away from
   the other center of activity. Thus, redfronted lemurs use different
   drinking and ranging tactics as a function of the distance of their core
   areas from the nearest water source.},

Abstract = {This is the first long-term, simultaneous, comparative study of three
   bamboo lemur species (Hapalemur griseus, H. aureus, and H. simus) at a
   site in southeastern-central Madagascar where they occur in sympatry. At
   Talatakely, Ranomafana National Park, the three Hapalemur spp. share
   overlapping home ranges. Hapalemur griseus has flexible group sizes,
   varying from three to nine individuals (n = 6). The home range of
   Hapalemur griseus averages 15 ha (n = 2). Hapalemur aureus forms family
   groups of less than or equal to 4 individuals (n = 3); they have a home
   range! on average of 26 ha (n = 2). The single group of Hapalemur simus
   is composed of one or three adult males, two adult females, and their
   offspring; they occupy a home range of 62 ha. The three species of
   Hapalemur are year-round bamboo specialists: >88\% of their diets
   consist of bamboo and grass in the Family Poaceae, Contrary to earlier
   findings, all three Hapalemur spp. consume the cynogenic parts-young
   leaf bases, young pseudopetioles, and young shoots-of the giant bamboo,
   Cathariostachys madagascariensis. They rely heavily on this plant, which
   comprises 72-95\% of their diets. Hapalemur griseus and H. aureus
   consume similar proportions of bamboo vs. nonbamboo plants, though they
   differ in the species of bamboo they prefer: Hapalemur simus has the
   most distinct diet of the three bamboo lemurs. They exploit the young
   shoots of Cathariostachys madagascariensis during the austral summer
   rainy season, between November and April. From June to November
   Hapalemur simus shifts its diet to eating the mature culm pith of
   Cathariostachys madagascariensis; the proportion of pith represented in
   their diet reaches a maximum of 89\% in October. Seasonal availability
   of food resources, feeding competition, and factors related to body size
   may provide clues to the understanding of diet selection among the three
   sympatric Hapalemur spp.},

Abstract = {Despite an increasing recognition of the ecosystem services provided by
   mangroves, we know little about their role in maintaining terrestrial
   biodiversity, including primates. Madagascar's lemurs are a top global
   conservation priority, with 94 \% of species threatened with extinction,
   but records of their occurrence in mangroves are scarce. I used a
   mixed-methods approach to collect published and unpublished observations
   of lemurs in mangroves: I carried out a systematic literature search and
   supplemented this with a targeted information request to 1243
   researchers, conservation and tourism professionals, and others who may
   have visited mangroves in Madagascar. I found references to, or
   observations of, at least 23 species in 5 families using mangroves,
   representing > 20\% of lemur species and > 50\% of species whose
   distributions include mangrove areas. Lemurs used mangroves for
   foraging, sleeping, and traveling between terrestrial forest patches,
   and some were observed as much as 3 km from the nearest permanently dry
   land. However, most records were anecdotal and thus tell us little about
   lemur ecology in this habitat. Mangroves are more widely used by lemurs
   than has previously been recognized and merit greater attention from
   primate researchers and conservationists in Madagascar.},

Title = {EVALUATION OF MODIFIED TECHNIQUES FOR IMMOBILIZATION OF WILD RING-TAILED
   LEMURS (LEMUR CATTA)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {42},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Wild ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) can be anesthetized with Telazol
   via blow dart, but improved techniques are needed so that each lemur is
   reliably induced with a single dart. Medetomidine-butorphanol (MB) is a
   good supplemental protocol to be administered once the lemurs are
   captured, but other protocols may provide longer periods of sedation and
   immobility. One possible way of increasing the efficacy of each dart is
   to increase the time it is retained in the leg. In this investigation, a
   ``double-sleeve{''} technique was used to try to increase the time of
   dart retention. This technique used a standard silicone sleeve on the
   needle, along with a second sleeve at the needle hub. Induction values
   were compared between lemurs darted with double-sleeve needles and those
   induced with needles that each had a single silicone sleeve. Once the
   lemurs were induced, supplementation with MB (0.04 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg)
   was compared with supplementation with ketamine-medetomidine (KM) (10
   mg/kg and 0.04 mg/kg). Twenty-three lemurs were darted with Telazol by
   using single-sleeve needles, and 24 were darted with double-sleeve
   needles. The number of darts per lemur and number of escapes were not
   different between animals darted with a single sleeve compared with a
   double-sleeve; thus, there were no significant improvements in induction
   success with the double-sleeve technique. Adequate sedation and muscle
   relaxation were achieved with both MB and KM; however, lemurs that
   received MB were more relaxed and needed fewer additional supplements
   that those that received KM. Single-sleeve dart needles are recommended
   for Telazol induction of ring-tailed lemurs via blow dart and MB is
   preferable to KM for supplemental sedation and muscle relaxation.},

Title = {Partially shared consensus decision making and distributed leadership in
   vervet monkeys: older females lead the group to forage},

Abstract = {Objectives: Group living can be advantageous, but for motile organisms,
   collective movements become necessary. We are just beginning to
   understand the many ways that animal groups make movement decisions and
   maintain cohesion. We examined start attempts and success in leading
   collective group movements in vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus)
   characterized by matrilineal groups and territoriality.
   Materials and methods: We recorded 179 start attempts in a single group
   of vervets at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda and examined individual success in
   three situations (departing from sleeping site, moving to forage,
   returning to sleeping site) relative to dominance rank, age, and sex.
   Results: Sex and age were associated with both the number of start
   attempts and success in leading group movements, but there was no effect
   of dominance rank. Older females were most successful at leading group
   movements, especially toward foraging sites, while adult and subadult
   males almost always led the group out of the sleeping site.
   Discussion: Collective group movements in vervet monkeys appear to be
   based on distributed leadership and partially shared consensus decision
   making. Older females may be repositories of ecological knowledge,
   resulting in their success at leading the group to forage. Male
   motivation to lead the way out of the sleeping site appeared related to
   accessing human food sources before other group members. Young natal
   males achieved some success leading group progressions because they were
   motivated to make many initiations, which may be related to their
   life-stage. These results give us a better understanding of the
   processes underlying collective movements in cohesive animal groups.},

Abstract = {Research on coordination and decision-making in humans and nonhuman
   primates has increased considerably throughout the last decade. However,
   terminology has been used inconsistently, hampering the broader
   integration of results from different studies. In this short article, we
   provide a glossary containing the central terms of coordination and
   decision-making research. The glossary is based on previous definitions
   that have been critically revised and annotated by the participants of
   the symposium ``Where next? Coordination and decision-making in primate
   groups{''} at the XXIIIth Congress of the International Primatological
   Society (IPS) in Kyoto, Japan. We discuss a number of conceptual and
   methodological issues and highlight consequences for their
   implementation. In summary, we recommend that future studies on
   coordination and decision-making in animal groups do not use the terms
   ``combined decision{''} and ``democratic/despotic decision-making.{''}
   This will avoid ambiguity as well as anthropocentric connotations.
   Further, we demonstrate the importance of 1) taxon-specific definitions
   of coordination parameters (initiation, leadership, followership,
   termination), 2) differentiation between coordination research on
   individual-level process and group-level outcome, 3) analyses of
   collective action processes including initiation and termination, and 4)
   operationalization of successful group movements in the field to collect
   meaningful and comparable data across different species.},

   evolution},
Journal = {SYMBIOSIS},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {123-141},
Abstract = {Karyological analyses of lemur taxa reveal Robertsonian chromosome
   rearrangements and pericentric inversions. Karyotypic fission
   (kinetochore reproduction) theory potentially explains lemur karyotype
   evolution. Application of the theory suggests that modem lemurs are
   derived from an ancestral primate with a diploid number of 20. All
   extant karyotypes of lepilemurid, lemurid, daubentoniid, indrid, and
   cheirogaleid are most parsimoniously explained as the product of four
   karyotypic fissions, two primary and two secondary, followed by
   pericentric inversions. The first fissioning event generated the
   karyotypic diversity that later became fixed in the ancestral stocks of
   the Daubentoniidae, Indridae, and a common lemurid-cheirogaleid stock.
   The ancestral stock of the Lepilemuridae was not affected by this event,
   but did experience a later independent fissioning of the ancestral
   2N=20, generating modern diploid numbers ranging from 20-38. A secondary
   fissioning event isolated the Lemuridae and Cheirogaleidae from one
   another. A separate secondary fissioning explains indrid karyotypes.
   Kinetochore research supplies mechanisms for karyotypic fissioning
   followed by normal segregation of fission-generated acrocentric
   chromosomes. This analysis is consistent with the theory of the origins
   of eukaryotic cells, including the mitotic and meiotic motility system,
   from fusion of archaebacterial and eubacterial (spirochete) lineages. Ad
   hoc theories of Robertsonian fusions require approximately 100
   independent events to generate the karyotypes of lemurs. Fission theory,
   consistent with the tendency of former endosymbionts to reproduce at
   different rates from their host cells, requires only 2-4 independent
   events.},

Title = {Lake pigments facilitate analysis of fecal cortisol and behavior in

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {116},
Number = {1},
Pages = {51-58},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Fecal steroid analyses are becoming more popular among both field and
   laboratory scientists. The benefits associated with sampling procedures
   that do not require restraint, anesthesia, and blood collection include
   less risk to both subject and investigator, as well as the potential to
   obtain endocrine profiles that do not reflect the influence of stress.
   However, the utility of the fecal steroid method has been limited in
   field conditions because of problems associated with sample
   identification. Here, we present evidence that Lake pigments are a
   valuable tool for the identification of individual fecal samples from
   group-housed female cynomolgus macaques. Further, we present data that
   suggest that excreted cortisol can be assayed from such samples, leading
   to the finding that time of day of sample collection influences cortisol
   concentrations, with morning samples producing higher values (t = 2.769,
   P = 0.024). Finally, the collection of physiological data from
   group-housed animals permits the evaluation of the relationship between
   endocrine status and behavior. This study demonstrated that morning
   fecal cortisol was significantly correlated with competitive and
   proximity behaviors, although not with rank in two stable social groups.
   In conclusion, the utility and validity of fecal steroid analyses
   continue to expand with further investigations. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss,

Title = {Comparison of different drying and storage methods on quantifiable
   concentrations of fecal steroids in the cheetah},
Journal = {ZOO BIOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {215-222},
Abstract = {Fecal steroid analysis is a powerful tool that can provide important
   information on the health, physiology, and reproductive status of
   nondomestic species. However, studying free-ranging animals requires
   that feces be stored and transported from the collection site to the
   laboratory in a manner that prevents degradation or alteration of
   steroid metabolites. To determine the effects of different handling and
   storage methods on fecal steroids, 30 fresh fecal samples from five
   captive cheetahs were collected, thoroughly mixed, separated into
   aliquots, and processed (stored or dried) under different conditions.
   Concentrations of gonadal and adrenal steroid hormones were analyzed in
   feces stored frozen at -20 degreesC or at room temperature in 95\%
   ethanol. Both frozen and ethanol-stored aliquots were desiccated using a
   lyophilizer, solar oven, or conventional oven. The steroid values from
   aliquots stored and desiccated using the different methods were compared
   to those obtained using the optimal storage method of freezing at -20
   degreesC and desiccating in a lyophilizer (control). Concentrations of
   corticoid, estrogen, progestagen, and androgen metabolites in fecal
   extracts were quantified by radioimmunoassay. Androgen metabolite
   concentrations were not significantly affected (P > 0.05) by storage or
   drying methods. Fecal samples stored at room temperature in ethanol and
   lyophilized also had steroid concentrations that did not differ (P >
   0.05) from controls. However, the concentrations of corticoid and
   estrogen metabolites were significantly lower (P < 0.05), and
   progestagen metabolites were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in samples
   desiccated in solar and conventional ovens without regard to storage
   method. These results suggest that storage of fecal samples at room
   temperature in ethanol is the best alternative to freezing for
   subsequent analysis of steroid hormone concentrations. Differences in
   measured concentrations of hormones in oven-desiccated samples could be
   due to hormone degradation or shifts in the immunodominant metabolite.
   Therefore, validation of storage and processing techniques should be
   included in the development of any new fecal steroid analysis
   methodology. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The correlation between the biomass of forest primates and a chemical
   index of the average nutritional quality of leaves in tropical forests
   has been repeatedly documented since 1990. We tested the role played by
   protein : fibre on lemur biomass in a gallery forest in southern
   Madagascar. Plant species abundance was determined based on transect
   censuses. We calculated an average ratio of protein-to-fibre in leaves
   and an abundance-weighted ratio, i.e. the mean weighted by the basal
   area of tree species, to be compared with the figures available for
   other forest ecosystems in Madagascar and a number of anthropoid
   habitats. Lemur densities were evaluated through compilation of previous
   studies made from prior to 1975 and up until 2011 based on strip
   censuses and/or identification of all groups supplemented with new
   censuses. A high mean ratio of protein to fibre (>0.4) supports high
   folivore biomass at 390 kg km(-2) (reaching 630 kg km(-2) in the
   closed-canopy forest area) compared with primate communities in other
   Malagasy forests (protein : fibre: <0.5; folivore biomass: <440 kg
   km(-2)), as predicted. However, the data corroborate the finding that
   the total biomass of lemur communities as well as the biomass of
   folivorous lemur species are low compared with those of African and
   Asian primate communities for a given protein : fibre ratio. Tree
   diversity and leaf production do not consistently explain this pattern.
   In contrast, the extinction of large folivorous lemurs during the past
   two millennia presumably allowed too little time for smaller-sized
   species to evolve equally effective morphological and physiological
   specializations for processing a large range of fibrous foods.},

Abstract = {Extractive industries can have significant impacts on ecosystems through
   loss of habitat, degradation of water quality, and direct impact on
   floral and faunal biodiversity. When operations are located in sensitive
   regions with high biodiversity containing endangered or threatened
   species, it is possible to minimize impact on the environment by
   developing programs to scientifically monitor the impact on resident
   flora and fauna species in the early phases of operation so that effects
   can be mitigated whenever possible. This report presents the baseline
   health, nutrition, and trace mineral evaluation for 33 Avahi laniger
   (Eastern wooly lemur) and 15 Lepilemur mustelinus (greater sportive
   lemur) captured and given complete health evaluations that included the
   measurement of fat-soluble vitamins and trace minerals in addition to
   routine complete blood counts, serum chemistries, and parasite
   evaluations. All lemurs appeared healthy on physical examination despite
   the presence of minor wounds consistent with interspecies aggression in
   some individuals. Serum chemistry values were within expected ranges for
   other lemur species; however, A. laniger erythrocytes were significantly
   smaller than those of L. mustelinus. Serum nickel values were markedly
   higher than expected in both species, and selenium, copper, and cobalt
   levels were higher in L. mustelinus compared with A. laniger at the
   study site, as well as values for I. indri or P. diadema reported from
   other locations. Endoparasites and ectoparasites were typical of those
   reported in other wild lemur species, but load and diversity varied
   between A. laniger and L. mustelinus despite inhabiting the same forest
   ecosystem. This baseline assessment provides the foundation for ongoing
   monitoring.},

Title = {The Organization of Collective Group Movements in Wild Barbary Macaques
   (Macaca sylvanus): Social Structure Drives Processes of Group
   Coordination in Macaques},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 21},
Abstract = {Social animals have to coordinate activities and collective movements to
   benefit from the advantages of group living. Animals in large groups
   maintain cohesion by self-organization processes whereas in smaller
   groups consensus decisions can be reached. Where consensus decisions are
   relevant leadership may emerge. Variation in the organization of
   collective movements has been linked to variation in female social
   tolerance among macaque species ranging from despotic to egalitarian.
   Here we investigated the processes underlying group movements in a wild
   macaque species characterized by a degree of social tolerance
   intermediate to previously studied congeneric species. We focused on
   processes before, during and after the departure of the first
   individual. To this end, we observed one group of wild Barbary macaques
   (Macaca sylvanus) in the Middle Atlas, Morocco using all-occurrence
   behaviour sampling of 199 collective movements. We found that initiators
   of a collective movement usually chose the direction in which more
   individuals displayed pre-departure behavior. Dominant individuals
   contributed to group movements more than subordinates, especially
   juveniles, measured as frequencies of successful initiations and
   pre-departure behaviour. Joining was determined by affiliative
   relationships and the number of individuals that already joined the
   movement (mimetism). Thus, in our study group partially shared consensus
   decisions mediated by selective mimetism seemed to be prevalent, overall
   supporting the suggestion that a species' social style affects the
   organization of group movements. As only the most tolerant species show
   equally shared consensus decisions whereas in others the decision is
   partially shared with a bias to dominant individuals the type of
   consensus decisions seems to follow a stepwise relation. Joining order
   may also follow a stepwise, however opposite, relationship, because
   dominance only determined joining in highly despotic, but not in
   intermediate and tolerant species.},

Title = {The gut microbiome of exudivorous marmosets in the wild and captivity},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Mammalian captive dietary specialists like folivores are prone to
   gastrointestinal distress and primate dietary specialists suffer the
   greatest gut microbiome diversity losses in captivity compared to the
   wild. Marmosets represent another group of dietary specialists,
   exudivores that eat plant exudates, but whose microbiome remains
   relatively less studied. The common occurrence of gastrointestinal
   distress in captive marmosets prompted us to study the Callithrix gut
   microbiome composition and predictive function through bacterial 16S
   ribosomal RNA V4 region sequencing. We sampled 59 wild and captive
   Callithrix across four species and their hybrids. Host environment had a
   stronger effect on the gut microbiome than host taxon. Wild Callithrix
   gut microbiomes were enriched for Bifidobacterium, which process
   host-indigestible carbohydrates. Captive marmoset guts were enriched for
   Enterobacteriaceae, a family containing pathogenic bacteria. While gut
   microbiome function was similar across marmosets, Enterobacteriaceae
   seem to carry out most functional activities in captive host guts. More
   diverse bacterial taxa seem to perform gut functions in wild marmosets,
   with Bifidobacterium being important for carbohydrate metabolism.
   Captive marmosets showed gut microbiome composition aspects seen in
   human gastrointestinal diseases. Thus, captivity may perturb the
   exudivore gut microbiome, which raises implications for captive
   exudivore welfare and calls for husbandry modifications.},

Abstract = {Collective decision-making is important for coordination and
   synchronization of the activities among group-living animals and the
   mechanisms guiding such procedure involve a great variety of
   characteristics of behavior and motivation. This study provides some
   evidence investigating collective movement initiation in a multi-level
   social band of the golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana)
   located in the Mts. Qinling, China. We collect 1223 datum records
   relevant to decision initiation from six OMUs. The results indicate that
   collective movement initiation could be divided into two continual but
   relatively independent processes: decisions on moving direction and
   movement implementation. In both processes, adult individuals are more
   likely to initiate the decision-making, while other adults vote on
   initiator's preference, with a threshold, a supporting number required
   for a success. Thus, voting behavior and quorum fulfillment contribute
   to a successful decision-making. Adult individuals play important role
   in making decisions for moving direction and implementation. For a
   successful collective movement initiation, the individuals being more
   central in grooming network initiate decisions more frequently than the
   others, and attract voters more easily. Furthermore, following the
   initiation, at least four positive voters are required for a direction
   decision and at least three positive voters are needed for the decision
   on movement implementation, which could be considered as the threshold
   of quorum numbers required for a successful decision. This study has
   provided some very interesting information and scientific evidence in
   understanding social structure and behaviors of the nonhuman primates
   with a social structure very similar to humans'. Thus, some results can
   directly be referred to the comprehension of human social structure and
   behavior.},

Abstract = {Tooth wear is generally an age-related phenomenon, often assumed to
   occur at similar rates within populations of primates and other mammals,

   study of primate behavior and ecology with dental analyses. Here, we
   present data on dental wear and tooth loss in older (> 10 years old)
   wild and captive ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). Among older
   ring-tailed lemurs at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve (BMSR),
   Madagascar (n=6), the percentage of severe dental wear and tooth loss
   ranges from 6 to 50\%. Among these six individuals, the oldest (19 years
   old) exhibits the second lowest frequency of tooth loss (14\%). The
   majority of captive lemurs at the Indianapolis Zoo (n=7) are older than
   the oldest BMSR lemur, yet display significantly less overall tooth wear
   for 19 of 36 tooth positions, with only two individuals exhibiting
   antemortem tooth loss. Among the captive lemurs, only one lemur (a
   nearly 29 year old male) has lost more than one tooth. This individual
   is only missing anterior teeth, in contrast to lemurs at BMSR, where the
   majority of lost teeth are postcanine teeth associated with processing
   specific fallback foods. Postcanine teeth also show significantly more
   overall wear at BMSR than in the captive sample. At BMSR, degree of
   severe wear and tooth loss varies in same aged, older individuals,
   likely reflecting differences in microhabitat, and thus the availability
   and use of different foods. This pattern becomes apparent before ``old
   age,{''} as seen in individuals as young as 7 years. Among the four
   ``older{''} female lemurs at BMSR, severe wear and/or tooth loss do not
   predict offspring survival. Am. J. Primatol. 72:1026-1037, 2010. (C)

Abstract = {The apocrine and sebaceous scent glands of ringtailed lemurs (Lemur
   catta) appear to serve different social functions. In behavioral
   experiments, lemurs modulate their responses to scent marks based on the
   type of odorant, their own physiological state, the signaler's
   physiological state, and prior social experience. To examine variation
   in odorant chemistry relative to olfactory behavior, we used gas
   chromatography and mass spectrometry to analyze over 86 samples of
   glandular secretion collected over 2 years from 15 adult lemurs. Labial
   and scrotal secretions contained organic acids and esters, whereas male
   brachial secretions were composed almost entirely of squalene and
   cholesterol derivatives. Principal component and linear discriminant
   analyses revealed glandular, individual-specific, and seasonal variation
   in chemical profiles but no relationship to the signaler's social
   status. The chemical composition of the various secretions provides
   further clues about the function of the different glands: the higher
   molecular weight compounds in genital and brachial secretions may
   increase signal longevity and provide lasting information to
   conspecifics, consistent with a role in advertising resource ownership
   or reproductive state. Conversely, the lower molecular weight compounds
   of antebrachial secretions produce ephemeral signals used primarily in
   social dominance displays and require integration of multiple sensory
   modalities for effective signal transmission.},

Abstract = {Lemurs demonstrate various mating systems but paradoxically lack sexual

   examine how testicles vary relative to body weight within a population
   of Malagasy lemurs. We show that the significant positive relationship
   between body size and testicles in non-breeding seasons dissipates in
   breeding seasons because the testicles of lighter males grow more and
   match heavier males' testicles. Low and unpredictable plant productivity
   characterizes Madagascar's ecosystems, and natural selection may favour
   testicle-body size decoupling during challenging years, inhibiting the
   evolution of dimorphic males.},

Title = {Testosterone levels of free-ranging resident mantled howler monkey males
   in relation to the number and density of solitary males: A test of the
   challenge hypothesis},
Journal = {HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {49},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The challenge hypothesis asserts that testosterone levels and aggression
   in male adult animals are closely associated with one another in the
   context of intense reproductive competition, particularly when males
   challenge one mother for the access to females. For mantled howler
   monkeys (Alouatta palliata), the presence of a solitary male in the
   vicinity of a social group can be considered a threat for the
   reproductive success of the resident males, as group takeovers by
   solitary males are followed by a reestablishment of the access to
   females among group males and sometimes by infanticide. Therefore, these
   episodes should be accompanied by an increase in testosterone secretion
   according to the challenge hypothesis. In order to test our prediction,
   we relate different group and subpopulation variables to the
   testosterone levels measured in feces collected from 10 groups living in
   6 forest fragments, at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. Our results suggest that
   resident A. palliata males regard solitary individuals as potential
   contesters for their reproductive success and that they respond to
   interactions with them with an increase in testosterone levels, that is
   increasing their aggressiveness. Our results also suggest that in the
   studied groups all mates have at least certain access to mates and that
   the entrance of a new male would affect their reproductive success
   negatively. Finally, the negative effects of chronically high
   testosterone levels may be negatively affecting the fitness of our study
   groups living in high population densities and small fragments. (c) 2005

Title = {Does female dominance facilitate feeding priority in black-and-white

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {66},

Abstract = {Although many Malagasy lemurs are thought to be female dominant and to
   have female feeding priority, to date the relationship between these
   behaviors has been rigorously established only in Lemur catta, and other
   ways that females might achieve feeding priority have not been examined
   closely. Erhart and Overdorff {[}International Journal of Primatology
   20:927-940, 1999] suggested that one way female primates achieve feeding
   priority is to initiate and lead groups to food, thereby gaining access
   to the food first and positively influencing their food intake compared
   to other group members. Here we describe female dominance patterns and
   potential measures of feeding priority in two groups of black-and-white
   ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata) that were observed over a 15-month
   period in southeastern Madagascar. We predicted that the females would
   1) be consistently dominant to males, 2) lead groups to food sources
   more often than males, and 3) have higher feeding rates compared to
   males when they arrived at food sources first. The results were
   dissimilar between the study groups. During the study, the oldest adult
   female in group 1 died. There was no evidence for female dominance in
   this group, and the remaining (likely natal) female did not lead the
   group more often, nor did she have a higher food intake than males.
   Group 1 dispersed shortly after the time frame reported here. In
   contrast, the resident female in group 2 was dominant to group males
   (based on agonistic interactions), led the group to food sources more
   often, and experienced a higher food intake when she arrived first at a
   food source. How these patterns vary over time and are influenced by the
   number of females in groups, group stability, food quality, and
   reproductive condition will be examined in future analyses. (c) 2005

Abstract = {In this paper, we aim at demonstrating individual recognition of female
   genital marking in Lemur catta. By gas chromatography and behavioural
   trials we verified the occurrence of the three components of recognition
   systems. We showed that each female has a unique chemical signature (
   expression component), and males and females perceive female
   individuality ( perception component). To verify the presence of the
   action component ( the last component of recognition systems), we
   designed a bioassay based on territorial competition to verify the
   functional response to female odours. Only females identified other
   females on the basis of their scents. The lack of a territorial
   functional response by males to female secretions may not indicate a
   male inability to identify females by their scents. In fact, sexual
   dimorphism in motivation and territorial defence may explain the
   response by males in the functional experiment. Actually, game theory
   predicts that males defend their own territories more vigorously against
   males compared with females. Therefore, the result of individual
   recognition bioassays of female odours may open interesting scenarios in
   the evaluation of the territorial defence investment across the
   different sex combinations.},

Abstract = {In polygynandrous mating systems, the factors that mediate copulation
   success and the use of alternative mating tactics, such as mate
   guarding, are still poorly understood. In the rock hyrax (Procavia
   capensis), both sexes mate annually with multiple partners during a
   single month. In order to examine the factors that drive copulation
   success, we used 494 mating-related observations that were collected
   over a decade. In our analysis, we used the traits of individual hyraxes
   as well as the traits of members of their sexual niche, which we defined
   as their local competitors and potential mates. Using individual traits,
   we found that overall, female hyraxes rejected copulation attempts more
   frequently than males, supporting predictions from sexual selection
   theory. Females who had been mothers in previous years were mate-guarded
   more by resident males. When we considered the traits of competitors and
   potential mates in individuals' sexual niche, we found that when
   resident males had higher-ranking competitors, their copulation success
   decreased, irrespective of their own traits. Bachelor male copulation
   success was not influenced by their competitor's social status. Female
   copulation success was positively affected by maternal status and by
   social network position. Females that were central in the social network
   and those that had central female competitors had higher copulation
   success, supporting the benefits of social cohesion and the importance
   of the social niche. Thus, our results suggest that in polygynandrous
   mating systems, copulation success is determined not only by individual
   quality but also by the social and sexual niches that the individual
   occupies.
   Social networks describe with whom individuals consort. The complex
   patterns of sexual relationships in animal societies can also be
   expressed as networks of mating-related interactions. During our
   long-term study on the dynamic social relationships of wild rock
   hyraxes, we observed complex sexual interactions. Our results show that
   hyraxes choose mating partners from their available mate pool (or sexual
   niche) taking into account the traits of their actual mates, other
   potential mates, and those of their competitors. These findings suggest
   that the sexual niche, describing the subset of available mating
   partners, is important for mate choice, with significant implications to
   the study of sexual selection.},

   be sustained indefinitely on a finite planet. Is the recent inflation in
   lemur taxonomy any more secure? The question is all the more worth
   asking because this is no isolated phenomenon: Madagascar's primates
   have not been alone in multiplying. The same burgeoning of species names
   has occurred throughout the order Primates(3,4) and beyond,(5) provoking
   both concern and energetic debate.(6-9) Interestingly, this debate has
   largely unfolded among ecologists, conservationists, and other
   ``consumers{''} of taxonomy; many ``producers{''} seem to be content to
   generate new taxonomies with a remarkable lack of introspection, as if
   they were no more than passive consequences of more lofty concerns. And
   because the same causes underlie taxonomic inflation in Madagascar as
   elsewhere, this extraordinary island once again presents us with a
   microcosm of the larger world.},

Abstract = {The lemurs of Madagascar represent a spectacular example of adaptive
   radiation among primates. Given the special setting under which they
   evolved (i.e. long isolation, geographical location, geological relief),
   they provide excellent models for study in many realms, and at different
   levels and scales, including diversity. At the same time, they occur in
   a `hottest hot spot' region for biodiversity conservation. Although
   there is no single definition of biodiversity, the most commonly used
   units to measure biodiversity are species - species richness, species
   abundance and, for conservation purposes in particular, species
   endemism. However, what a species actually is or how, precisely, it
   should be defined are unresolved issues. Many species concepts have been
   proposed and several have been used in primatology in recent years.
   Nowadays, one of the more common approaches to measuring diversity, and
   eventually inferring species status, is to look at genetic diversity as
   reflected by mitochondrial DNA differences. Not enough attention has
   been paid, however, to the different levels at which genetic differences
   may occur. Lemurs provide instructive examples to highlight the
   questions involved in species recognition and definition. Using lemurs
   as examples, I will highlight the strengths and limitations of some
   analytical tools, including phylogeography and cladistic biogeography
   and, I will, in particular, emphasize the questions arising at the
   interface of scientific and conservation perceptions, both of which
   influence decisions in the field of biodiversity preservation. Copyright

Title = {Co-infection patterns of intestinal parasites in arboreal primates

Abstract = {Non-human primates of South-East Asia remain under-studied concerning
   parasite epidemiology and co-infection patterns. Simultaneously, efforts
   in conservation demand knowledge of parasite abundance and biodiversity
   in threatened species. The Endangered proboscis monkey, Nasalis
   larvatus, a primate flagship species for conservation in Borneo, was
   investigated in the present study. Habitat loss and fragmentation are
   among the greatest threats to bachelor and harem groups of this
   folivorous colobine. Designed as a follow-up study, prevalence and
   co-infection status of intestinal parasites from N. larvatus in a
   protected area in Malaysian Borneo were analyzed from fecal samples
   using a flotation method. For the first time, the intestinal parasite
   co-infection patterns were examined using quantitative analyses.
   Overall, 92.3\% of fecal samples (N = 652) were positive for helminth
   eggs. Five helminth groups were detected: (1) trichurids (82.7\%
   prevalence) including Trichuris spp. (82.1\%) and Anatrichosoma spp.
   (1.4\%), (2) strongyles (58.9\%) including Trichostrongylus spp.
   (48.5\%) and Oesophagostomum/Ternidens spp. (22.8\%), (3) Strongyloides
   fuelleborni (32.7\%), (4) Ascaris lumbricoides (8.6\%), and (5)
   Enterobius spp. (5.5\%). On average, an individual was co-infected with
   two different groups. Significant positive associations were found for
   co-infections of trichurids with strongyles and S. fuelleborni as well
   as S. fuelleborni with A. lumbricoides and strongyles. This study shows
   a high prevalence of various gastrointestinal helminths with potential
   transmission pathways primarily related to soil and with zoonotic
   relevance in wild proboscis monkeys in their remaining natural habitats.
   Observed positive associations of trichurids with strongyles and
   Strongyloides spp. may result from the high prevalence of trichurids.
   Similarly, positive associations between Strongyloides and Ascaris were
   found, both of which typically occur predominantly in juvenile hosts.
   These findings should be considered when proposing conservation actions
   in altered habitats nearby human settlements and when managing captive
   populations. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

Title = {Body mass of wild bornean orangutans living in human-dominated
   landscapes: Implications for understanding their ecology and

Abstract = {Body mass is a key determinant of a species' ecology, including
   locomotion, foraging strategies, and energetics. Accurate information on
   the body mass of wild primates allows us to develop explanatory models
   for relationships among body size, ecology, and behavior and is crucial
   for reconstructing the ecology and behavior of fossil primates and
   hominins. Information on body mass can also provide indirect information
   on health and can be an important tool for conservation in the context
   of increasingly widespread habitat disturbance. This study reports body
   mass data recorded for wild Northeast Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus
   morio) during relocation efforts in forestry and oil palm plantations in
   East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The average mass of flanged adult males (n =
   12, 74 +/- 9.78 kg) and adult females (n = 7, 35.29 +/- 7.32 kg) from
   this study were 13.6\% and 9\% lower, respectively, than the only other
   published wild Bornean orangutan body mass measurements, but the range
   of weights for both males and females was larger for this study. This
   pattern could be due to sampling error, data collection differences, or
   the influence of habitat disturbance, specifically a lack of access to
   resources, on individual health. When necessary relocations present the
   opportunity, we encourage researchers to prioritize the collection of
   body size data for the purposes of understanding ecology but also as an
   indirect means of monitoring population viability. As primate habitat
   becomes increasingly fragmented and altered by humans such data will
   become critical to our ability to make informed conservation decisions.

Title = {VARIATION IN SOCIAL-STRUCTURE - THE EFFECTS OF SEX AND KINSHIP ON SOCIAL
   INTERACTIONS IN 3 LEMUR SPECIES},
Journal = {ETHOLOGY},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {93},
Number = {2},
Pages = {125-145},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The effects of sex and kinship on agonistic and affinitive interactions
   in Lemur catta, Eulemur fulvus, and Eulemur coronatus were examined to
   provide information on the social structure of these primates. All adult
   males and females of three captive forest-living groups served as focal
   animals for one year. In contrast to many anthropoid primates, social
   interactions in these lemurs are characterized by predominantly
   competitive relations among closely related females, with low overall
   rates of polyadic conflicts. In L. catta, same-sexed dyads and pairs of
   closely related individuals had higher proximity-corrected frequencies
   of agonistic interactions than male-female and non-kin dyads. Grooming
   interactions, on the other hand, occurred significantly more often than
   expected in male-female pairs and between unrelated animals. The
   top-ranking male monopolized the majority of male-female interactions.
   In E. fulvus, neither sex nor kinship had significant effects on the
   distribution of grooming and agonistic interactions. Unlike L. catta,
   grooming and conflicts were observed in all dyads, resulting in more
   complex social relationships. Male-female relationships in E. fulvus
   were characterized by strong affiliative relations between individual
   male-female pairs. Social relationships in E. coronatus were generally
   similar to those in E. fulvus, except for a significant sex effect on
   the distribution of interactions, but small sample size precluded a
   final characterization of this rare species.
   Collectively, these results suggest that there may be intense
   competition among individual female lemurs for group membership, even
   among close relatives in the same matriline. Moreover, interspecific
   contrasts in male-male and intersexual relationships indicate
   fundamentally different male roles in these species. This study revealed
   that patterns of agonistic and affinitive interactions are not generally
   predictable from sexual selection theory and interspecific differences
   in life histories, indicating a need for more quantitative descriptions
   of social relationships in diverse taxa to identify other ecological and
   social determinants of social structure.},

Title = {Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) respond to yellow-bellied marmot

Journal = {ETHOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {118},
Number = {3},
Pages = {243-250},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Individuals may obtain valuable information about the presence of
   predators by listening to heterospecific alarm signals. Most playback
   studies have demonstrated that similarly sized and taxonomically related
   species may respond to the calls of each other, but less work has been
   carried out to define these factors influence responsiveness to alarm
   signals. In theory, individuals should respond to calls from any species
   that provide information about the presence of important predators,
   regardless of body size or taxonomic relationship. However, size is
   often associated with vulnerability. Coyotes (Canis latrans) in the
   Rocky Mountains prey upon both mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and
   yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris), which differ considerably
   in size, alarm vocalizations, and antipredator behavior. We conducted a
   playback experiment to see whether deer discriminated between marmot
   alarm calls and the non-alarm song of a common sympatric bird. We found
   that deer increased vigilance significantly more after hearing broadcast
   marmot alarm calls compared with the bird song. Interestingly, deer that
   were studied within 0.5 km of homes showed significantly greater
   discrimination than those studied farther from humans. Our results
   suggest relative size differences do not prevent interspecific
   communication and that common predators should generally drive the
   evolution of the ability to learn to respond to meaningful risk cues. As
   long as two species share a predator, it should benefit the other to
   respond to its alarm calls.},

Title = {Conservation biology of Malagasy strepsirhines: A phylogenetic approach},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {130},
Number = {2},
Pages = {238-253},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The phylogenetic diversity of extant lemurs represents one of the most
   important but least studied aspects of the conservation biology of
   primates. The phylogenetic diversity of a species is inversely
   proportional to the relative number and closeness of its phylogenetic
   relatives. Phylogenetic diversity can then be used to determine
   conservation priorities for specific biogeographic regions. Although
   Malagasy strepsirhines represent the highest phylogenetic diversity
   among primates at the global level, there are few phylogenetic data on
   species-specific and regional conservation plans for lemurs in
   Madagascar. Therefore, in this paper the following questions are
   addressed for extant lemurs: 1) how does the measure of taxonomic
   uniqueness used by Mittermeier et al. U9921 Lemurs of Madagascar; Gland,
   Switzerland: IUCN) equate with an index of phylogenetic diversity, 2)
   what are the regional conservation priorities based on analyses of
   phylogenetic diversity in extant lemurs, and 3) what conservation
   recommendations can be made based on analyses of phylogenetic diversity
   in lemurs? Taxonomic endemicity standardized weight (TESW) indices of
   phylogenetic diversity were used to determine the evolutionary component
   of biodiversity and to prioritize regions for conserving lemur taxa.
   TESW refers to the standardization of phylogenetic diversity indices for
   widespread taxa and endemicity of species. The phylogenetic data came
   from recent genetic studies of Malagasy strepsirhines at the species
   level. Lemur species were assigned as being either present or absent in
   six biogeographic regions. TESW indices were combined with data on lemur
   complementarity and protected areas to assign conservation priorities at
   the regional level. Although there were no overall differences between
   taxonomic ranks and phylogenetic rankings, there were significant
   differences for the top-ranked taxa. The phylogenetic component of lemur
   diversity is greatest for Daubentonia madagascariensis, Allocebus
   trichotis, Lepilemur septentrionalis, Indri indri, and Mirza coquereli.
   Regional conservation priorities are highest for lemurs that range into
   northeast humid forests and western dry forests. Expansion of existing
   protected areas in these regions may provide the most rapid method for
   preserving lemurs. In the long term, new protected areas must be created
   because there are lemur species that: 1) are not found in existing
   protected areas, 2) exist only in one or two protected areas, and 3) are
   still being discovered outside the current network of protected areas.
   Data on the population dynamics and feeding ecology of phylogenetically
   important species are needed to ensure that protected areas adequately
   conserve lemur populations in Madagascar.},

Title = {Roost selection by synanthropic bats in rural Madagascar: what makes
   non-traditional structures so tempting?},
Journal = {HYSTRIX-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-35},
Abstract = {Humanised landscapes are causing population declines and even
   extinctions of wildlife, whereas a limited number of species are
   adapting to the new niches and resources within these modified habitats.
   Synanthropy is widespread among many vertebrates and often causes
   co-habitation conflicts between humans and wildlife species. Bats often
   roost in anthropogenic structures, and especially in the tropics,
   mitigation of human-bat conflicts arising from co-habitation is hampered
   by a paucity of research focusing on roost preferences. We assessed
   roost selection by bats in villages around Ranomafana National Park,
   eastern Madagascar. Ten villages were surveyed, with bats occupying 21
   of the 180 evaluated buildings. Of those, 17 were public buildings
   harbouring large molossid colonies. Although beneficial ecosystem
   services provided by bats are well-known, several cases of colony
   eviction were noted, mostly due to unwanted co-habitation. Bat
   preference was driven by the type of building, its height and a lack of
   fire use by the inhabitants. Colonies were mainly found under metal
   sheets within large empty chambers, whereas only isolated bats were
   detected in the roofs of traditional cabins. Temperatures up to 50
   degrees C were recorded inside a roost, representing one of the highest
   temperatures recorded for an African maternity roost. Molossidae bats
   appear to have found a suitable alternative to their native roosts in
   hollow, old and tall trees in pristine forests, which are becoming rare
   in Madagascar. This suggests that human-bat interactions in Madagascar
   will likely increase alongside rural development and the loss of primary
   forest habitats. Shifting to modern construction methods while combining
   traditional techniques with proper roof sealing could prevent the
   establishment of bat colonies in undesired locations, whereas
   co-habitation conflicts could alternatively be minimised by reducing
   direct interaction with humans. In light of our results, we urge caution
   with bat evictions, and greater attention when introducing modern
   building practices, often supported by foreign initiatives, to poor
   rural communities in developing countries.},

Title = {LemurFaceID: a face recognition system to facilitate individual
   identification of lemurs},
Journal = {BMC ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Background: Long-term research of known individuals is critical for
   understanding the demographic and evolutionary processes that influence
   natural populations. Current methods for individual identification of
   many animals include capture and tagging techniques and/or researcher
   knowledge of natural variation in individual phenotypes. These methods
   can be costly, time-consuming, and may be impractical for larger-scale,
   population-level studies. Accordingly, for many animal lineages,
   long-term research projects are often limited to only a few taxa.
   Lemurs, a mammalian lineage endemic to Madagascar, are no exception.
   Long-term data needed to address evolutionary questions are lacking for
   many species. This is, at least in part, due to difficulties collecting
   consistent data on known individuals over long periods of time. Here, we
   present a new method for individual identification of lemurs
   (LemurFaceID). LemurFaceID is a computer-assisted facial recognition
   system that can be used to identify individual lemurs based on
   photographs.
   Results: LemurFaceID was developed using patch-wise Multiscale Local
   Binary Pattern features and modified facial image normalization
   techniques to reduce the effects of facial hair and variation in ambient
   lighting on identification. We trained and tested our system using
   images from wild red-bellied lemurs (Eulemur rubriventer) collected in
   Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. Across 100 trials, with different
   partitions of training and test sets, we demonstrate that the
   LemurFaceID can achieve 98.7\% +/- 1.81\% accuracy (using 2-query image
   fusion) in correctly identifying individual lemurs.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that human facial recognition
   techniques can be modified for identification of individual lemurs based
   on variation in facial patterns. LemurFaceID was able to identify
   individual lemurs based on photographs of wild individuals with a
   relatively high degree of accuracy. This technology would remove many
   limitations of traditional methods for individual identification. Once
   optimized, our system can facilitate long-term research of known
   individuals by providing a rapid, cost-effective, and accurate method
   for individual identification.},

Abstract = {Lemur catta troops in a 1-km(2) study area at Berenty Reserve have
   maintained fidelity to core areas since Budnitz and Dainis' study of
   1972-1973, and for two troops possibly since 1963. Population in 1 km(2)
   fluctuated from 155 to 105 to 282 individuals (excluding infants), and
   the number of troops increased from 12 to 21. Most troops retain the
   same core areas from year to year (170 observed troop-years). Ten troops
   derived from known fissions. have settled in parts of their parent troop
   range or an adjacent neighbor's range. Five more troops may derive from
   similar matrilocal fissioning, inferred from behavior and ranging
   patterns. One has remained unchanged. Five have unknown parentage, in
   the ranges of four previously censused troops. Once a fissioned troop
   completely replaced another; one troop permanently extended its range,
   three times females joined a different troop, once a female remained
   nomadic for two years without stable home range. No fissioned troop has
   been seen to leapfrog others: to settle discontiuously from its parent.
   Intertroop antagonism may reflect benefits of long-term core area

Year = {2018},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Sex-biased power structures are common in human and nonhuman primate
   societies. ``Female dominance{''} is a term applied to a wide range of
   female-biased power structures. However, the full extent of this
   variation remains obscure because an adequate vocabulary of power has
   not been adopted consistently. Female power occurs throughout primates
   and other animals, even in male-dominant societies, but the legacy of
   patriarchy persists in primatologists' use of language and implicit
   assumptions about intersexual power. While explanations for the
   occurrence of female power can be accommodated within existing
   ethological theory, many hypotheses seeking to explain the evolution of
   female power are narrowly focused on particular taxa. Theories about
   primate social evolution would benefit from a synthesis of the disparate
   literature on power, increased emphasis on intersexual social
   relationships, and comparative studies that include the full behavioral
   diversity of primates and other mammals.},

Abstract = {We examined genetic consequences of basic predictions of life history
   and sexual selection theory in a wild population of redfronted lemurs.
   Because group living in lemurs evolved independently from other
   primates, and because polygynous lemurs deviate in several sexually
   selected traits from theoretical predictions, data on genetic correlates
   of their social and mating systems can make important contributions to
   studies of convergence in social evolution, but such data are not
   available from wild populations. We extracted DNA from tissue samples
   obtained from 59 animals living in Kirindy forest, Madagascar, and
   examined individual variability at several microsatellite loci and the
   mitochondrial D-loop. We found that closely related females of a single
   matriline formed the core of the four main study groups. Virtually all
   haplotypes of adult males differed from those of coresident females, and
   many male haplotypes were represented by only one or two individuals.
   Paternity analyses for infants from groups with detailed behavioural
   data revealed that a disproportionate share of infants were sired by the
   central, dominant male of a group, despite promiscuous mating.
   Extragroup paternities were not detected. The skew in male reproductive
   success cannot be reconciled with the lack of sexual dimorphism and the
   even adult sex ratios. We therefore conclude that these group-living
   lemurs converge with many other primates in sex-specific life history
   trajectories, including female philopatry and male dispersal, but that
   the observed skew in male reproductive success makes the apparent lack
   of adaptation to intrasexual selection in certain behavioural;
   demographic and morphological traits even more puzzling. (C) 2002 The

   Reserve, Madagascar, during Reproductive Periods},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {80},
Number = {4},
Pages = {249-263},
Abstract = {Primates vary in their choice or avoidance of plant foods high in
   condensed tannins (CT). Our study focused on CT intake in two groups of
   Lemur catta residing in spiny forest habitat during two reproductive
   periods. We examined whether L. catta in this habitat avoided plant
   foods high in CT, and whether reproductive females ingested lower
   concentrations of CT compared with males, since CT consumption
   compromises protein absorption. Feeding data and plant food samples were
   collected during reproductive periods in 2006 (early/mid-lactation) and
   2007 (early gestation). Food samples were assayed for CT content, and
   average CT intake was determined for all focal animals. No significant
   difference was found in CT content of the most commonly consumed foods
   compared with other foods in each season or between seasons. No sex
   differences occurred in CT consumption in either reproductive period.
   These L. catta did not avoid plant foods high in CT, and three
   strategies-ingesting small amounts of CT regularly, high amounts only
   over short periods, and geophagy-may assist these lemurs in coping with
   CT content in their highly seasonal diet. L. catta may also be somewhat
   physiologically adapted to cope with CT concentrations in their plant
   foods. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Title = {Travel and Spatial Patterns Change When Chiropotes satanas chiropotes

Abstract = {Previous studies have used home range size to predict a species'
   vulnerability to forest fragmentation. Northern bearded saki monkeys
   (Chiropotes satanas chiropotes) are medium-bodied frugivores with large
   home ranges, but sometimes they reside in forest fragments that are
   smaller than the species' characteristic home range size. Here we
   examine how travel and spatial patterns differ among groups living in
   forest fragments of 3 size classes (1 ha, 10 ha, and 100 ha) versus
   continuous forest. We collected data in 6 research cycles from
   July-August 2003 and January 2005-June 2006 at the Biological Dynamics
   of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP), north of Manaus, Brazil. For each
   cycle, we followed the monkeys at each study site from dawn until dusk
   for 3 consecutive days, and recorded their location. Although bearded
   saki monkeys living in 10-ha and 1-ha fragments had smaller day ranges
   and traveled shorter daily distances, they traveled greater distances
   than expected based on the size of the forest fragment. Monkeys in the
   small fragments revisited a greater percentage of feeding trees each
   day, traveled in more circular patterns, and used the fragments in a
   more uniform pattern than monkeys in the continuous forest. Our results
   suggest that monkeys in the small fragments maximize their use of the
   forest, and that the preservation of large tracts of forest is essential
   for species conservation. Species with large home ranges sometimes
   inhabit forest fragments, but doing so can alter behavior, demographics,
   and ecology, and the monkeys may be vulnerable to stochastic events.},

Title = {Natural disasters and primate populations: The effects of a 2-year

Abstract = {We examine demographic patterns from a long-term study (1987-1996) of
   the population of ring-tailed lemurs in the Beza-Mahafaly Special
   Reserve, in southwestern Madagascar In particular we focus on the
   effects that a severe drought in 1991 and 1992 had on the population.
   The population of adult animals peaked in 1991 but decreased rapidly
   during the subsequent drought and immediate postdrought years. In the
   1992 birth season (and second year of the drought) infant mortality
   reached 80\%, and 20.8\% of all adult females in the reserve died. The
   following year adult female mortality reached a high of 29.9\%. Juvenile
   mortality in 3 intensively studied groups was 57\% during the second
   year of the drought. We compare these data with infant, juvenile, and
   adult female mortality in non-drought years. We are not able to
   calculate adult male mortality, as they often emigrate from the reserve
   to the adjacent forest; however in the same 3 intensively studied
   groups, 89\% of the males disappeared during the 2 immediate postdrought
   years. By 1996 the population had begun to recover after the decline
   that correlated with the drought conditions. Annual reproduction, high
   birth rates (.80-.86 annually), early sexual maturity and dietary
   adaptability may be contributing factors to the recovery. Effects of and
   recovery from this type of natural disaster in the Beza Mahafaly
   ring-tailed lemur population parallel responses of some species of
   macaques and baboons with respect to the adaptability of edge species.},

Title = {Male life history and the unusual adult sex ratios of redfronted lemur,

Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {67},

Abstract = {In group-living species, theoretical considerations indicate the
   existence of a fundamental conflict of interest between the sexes over
   the adult sex ratio within groups. Females may derive certain benefits
   from living with many males. Males, in contrast, should generally try to
   monopolize access to a group of females. Which sex ultimately controls
   adult group sex ratio is poorly known. We examined this conflict between
   the sexes in redfronted lemurs, Malagasy primates characterized by an
   unusual lack of female-biased adult sex ratios. Using various
   demographic and behavioural data from several groups collected over 6
   years, we examined (1) the proximate determinants of this unusual sex
   ratio, (2) the temporal distribution of female fertile phases within
   groups as a determinant of male monopolization potential, (3) sources of
   between-group variation in the adult sex ratio, and (4) possible social
   benefits of the relatively high number of males for both sexes. Birth
   and mortality rates were not sex biased and males migrated considerably
   more frequently than females, providing no proximate explanation for the
   unusual sex ratio. However, certain life history traits (fast
   maturation, short interbirth intervals) may ultimately play a role
   because they act to facilitate joint group transfers of male coalitions.
   Despite a relatively small female group size and an associated high
   monopolization potential, female oestrous synchrony may prevent the
   formation of single-male groups. Reduced male group size seems to be the
   main predictor of take-over rate, and, thus, infanticide risk,
   suggesting that both sexes may benefit from the high number of
   coresident males, thereby considerably defusing the conflict of interest
   between the sexes. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal

Title = {Daily lettuce supplements promote foraging behavior and modify the gut

Abstract = {For captive primates, greater provisioning of leafy greens or foliage
   can promote natural foraging behavior while boosting fiber intake.
   Recalcitrant fiber, although minimally available to endogenous
   metabolism, is readily fermented into nutrients by gut microbes. Whereas
   most primates in captivity consume fiber-limited diets and harbor
   imbalanced gut microbiota compared to their wild conspecifics, the
   importance of fiber provisioning to primate gut microbiota has
   predominately been studied in folivores. We, therefore, determined if
   commercial lettuce could be used to encourage foraging behavior and
   modify the gut microbiota of captive frugivores. We provisioned ruffed
   lemurs (Varecia rubraandV. variegata) with romaine lettuce, on top of
   the standard dietary fare, for 10 consecutive days. Before and across
   the period of lettuce supplementation, we collected observational data
   of animal feeding and fecal samples for microbiome analysis, determined
   via amplicon sequencing. The ruffed lemurs and their gut microbes
   responded to lettuce provisioning. In particular, younger animals
   readily ate lettuce and showed no decline in consumption across study
   days. When controlling for the effects of host species and social-group
   membership, lettuce consumption shifted the composition of the gut
   microbiome away from each lemur's own baseline, an effect that became
   stronger as the study progressed. In the final study
   days,Ruminococcaceae UCG-008andAkkermansia, microbes typically and
   respectively associated with fiber metabolism and host health, were
   significantly enriched in the consortia of lettuce-provisioned subjects.
   Ultimately, the routine offering of lettuce, leafy greens, or foliage to
   captive frugivores may benefit animal wellbeing.},

Title = {Variation in fecal testosterone levels, inter-male aggression, dominance
   rank and age during mating and post-mating periods in wild adult male
   ring-tailed Lemurs (Lemur catta)},

Year = {2007},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In primate species exhibiting seasonal reproduction, patterns of
   testosterone excretion in adult males are variable: in some species,
   peaks correlate with female receptivity periods and heightened male-male
   aggression over access to estrous females, in others, neither heightened
   aggression nor marked elevations in testosterone have been noted. In
   this study, we examined mean fecal testosterone ( f T) levels and
   intermale aggression in wild adult male ring-tailed lemurs residing in
   three groups at Beza Mahafaly Reserve, Madagascar. Results obtained from
   mating and post-mating season 2003 were compared to test Wingfield et
   al. {[}1990. Am Nat 136:829-846] ``challenge hypothesis{''}, which
   predicts a strong positive relationship between male testosterone levels
   and male-male competition for access to receptive females during
   breeding season. f T levels and rates of intermale aggression were
   significantly higher during mating season compared to the post-mating
   period. Mean f T levels and aggression rates were also higher in the
   first half of the mating season compared with the second half. Number of
   males in a group affected rates of intermale agonism, but not mean f T
   levels. The highest-ranking males in two of the groups exhibited higher
   mean f T levels than did lower-ranking males, and young males exhibited
   lower f IT levels compared to prime-aged and old males. In the
   post-mating period, mean male f T levels did not differ between groups,
   nor were there rank or age effects. Thus, although male testosterone
   levels rose in relation to mating and heightened male-male aggression, f
   T levels fell to baseline breeding levels shortly after the early mating
   period, and to baseline non-breeding levels immediately after mating
   season had ended, offsetting the high cost of maintaining both high
   testosterone and high levels of male-male aggression in the early
   breeding period.},

Abstract = {Understanding how primates adjust their behavior in response to
   seasonality in both continuous and fragmented forests is a fundamental
   challenge for primatologists and conservation biologists. During a 15-mo
   period, we studied the activity patterns of 6 communities of spider
   monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) living in continuous and fragmented forests
   in the Lacandona rain forest, Mexico. We tested the effects of forest
   type (continuous and fragmented), season (dry and rainy), and their
   interaction on spider monkey activity patterns. Overall, monkeys spent
   more time feeding and less time traveling in fragments than in
   continuous forest. A more leafy diet and the spatial limitations in
   fragments likely explain these results. Time spent feeding was greater
   in the rainy than in the dry season, whereas time spent resting followed
   the opposite pattern. The increase in percent leaves consumed, and
   higher temperatures during the dry season, may contribute to the
   observed increase in resting time because monkeys probably need to
   reduce energy expenditure. Forest type and seasonality did not interact
   with activity patterns, indicating that the effect of seasonality on
   activities was similar across all sites. Our findings confirm that
   spider monkeys are able to adjust their activity patterns to deal with
   food scarcity in forest fragments and during the dry season. However,
   further studies are necessary to assess if these shifts are adequate to
   ensure their health, fitness, and long-term persistence in fragmented
   habitats.},

Abstract = {Fallback foods are often viewed as central in shaping primate
   morphology, and influencing adaptive shifts in hominin and other primate
   evolution. Here we argue that fruit of the tamarind tree (Tamarindus
   indica) qualifies as a fallback food of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)
   at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve (BMSR), Madagascar. Contrary to
   predictions that fallback foods may select for dental and masticatory
   morphologies adapted to processing these foods, consumption of tamarind
   fruit by these lemurs leaves a distinct pattern of dental pathology
   among ring-tailed lemurs at BMSR. Specifically, the physical and
   mechanical properties of tamarind fruit likely result in a high
   frequency of severe tooth wear, and subsequent antemortem tooth loss, in
   this lemur population. This pattern of dental pathology is amplified
   among lemurs living in disturbed areas at Beza Mahafaly, resulting from
   a disproportionate emphasis on challenging tamarind fruit, due to few
   other fruits being available. This is in part caused by a reduction in
   ground cover and other plants due to livestock grazing. As such,
   tamarind trees remain one of the few food resources in many areas.
   Dental pathologies are also associated with the use of a nonendemic leaf
   resource Argemone mexicana, an important food during the latter part of
   the dry season when overall food availability is reduced. Such dental
   pathologies at Beza Mahafaly, resulting from the use or overemphasis of
   fallback foods for which they are not biologically adapted, indicate
   that anthropogenic factors must be considered when examining fallback
   foods. Am J Phys Anthropol 140:671-686, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The conventional notion is that small-bodied primates should be highly
   insectivorous in order to obtain protein and other nutrients from a food
   source that is more easily digestible than plant matter. I studied
   feeding behavior of Microcebus rufus for IG months in the east coast
   rainforest of Ranomafana National Park. I determined the diet primarily
   through analysis of 334 fecal samples from live-trapped individuals,
   They consumed a mixed diet basically of fruit and insects year-round. I
   identified 24 fruits, while 40-52 remain unidentified. Bakerella, a
   high-lipid epiphytic semiparasitic plant, was in 58\% of fecal samples
   that contained fruit seeds, and was consumed year-round irrespective of
   general resource availability? It served both as a staple and keystone
   resource. Fruit was less frequently totally absent from fecal samples of
   individual mouse lemurs than insect matter was. For Microcebus rufus,
   fruit,may be a primary source of energy: not just complementary to
   insects. Fruit consumption increased in quantity and diversity during
   the latter part of the rainy season and the very Early part of the dry
   season, when fruit production was relatively high. This pattern in fruit
   feeding is similar to that for mouse lemurs in the west coast dry
   forests and is related to specific nutritional needs dictated by the
   highly seasonal character of the life cycle. Coleoptera were present in
   67\% of samples examined a,ld were consumed year-round by the subjects,
   but insect consumption did not increase during the rainy season when
   insect abundance was highest.},

Title = {SUMMER AND WINTER VITAMIN D-3 LEVELS IN FOUR LEMUR SPECIES HOUSED AT A
   BRITISH ZOO, WITH REFERENCE TO UVB LEVELS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {46},

Pages = {498-505},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Serum samples were collected from 18 lemurs of four diurnal/cathemeral
   species housed with outdoor access at Bristol Zoo Gardens (United
   Kingdom) to test 25-hydroxy-vitamin D-3 (25OHD(3)) levels as part of the
   veterinary department's preventative health care program. Samples were
   collected from each lemur in August 2008 (summer) and January 2009
   (winter) to examine the effect of season on 25OHD(3) levels. The lemurs
   were fed commercial primate food and a range of fruit and vegetables,
   and dietary levels of vitamin D-3 remained the same throughout the study
   period. Statistical analysis showed that the lemurs' summer 25OHD(3)
   values (range 26.7 to >150.0 mu g/L) were significantly higher than
   their winter 25OHD(3) values (range 11.4-87.1 mu g/L). UVB measurements
   taken during the study period confirmed that UVB levels were
   significantly higher in summer (mean reading for 1200-1300 GMT time
   period 153.8 mu W/cm(2)) compared to winter (mean reading for 1200-1300
   GMT time period 19.4 mu W/cm(2)). The 25OHD(3) levels measured were
   generally found to be high compared to previously published values from
   wild (free-ranging) lemurs in Madagascar. The most likely explanation
   for this was the higher vitamin D-3 content of the captive lemurs' diet,
   as UVB levels at the zoo (latitude 518 north) are substantially lower
   than those that occur in Madagascar (latitude 128-268 south). No
   evidence of vitamin D toxicity or deficiency was found in any of the
   captive lemurs. The results indicate that vitamin D-3 levels in lemurs
   housed with outdoor access in the United Kingdom and by extension, other
   regions of similar latitude, vary with seasonal environmental UVB
   levels, in a similar way to the seasonal variations in vitamin D-3
   observed in humans living in these regions, but that vitamin D levels in
   this captive lemur population were adequate compared to wild lemur
   levels, even in winter.},

Abstract = {Little is known about ingested food size (V-b) in primates, even though
   this variable has potentially important effects on food intake and
   processing. This study provides the first data on V-b in strepsirrhine
   primates using a captive sample of 17 species. These data can be used
   for generating and testing models of feeding energetics. Strepsirrhines
   are of interest because they are hypometabolic and chewing rate and
   daily feeding time do not show a significant scaling relationship with
   body size. Using melon, carrot, and sweet potato we found that maximum
   V-b scales isometrically with body mass and mandible length. Low dietary
   quality in larger strepsirrhines might explain why V-b increases with
   body size at a greater rate than does resting metabolic rate. Relative
   to body size, V-b is large in frugivores but small in folivores;
   furthermore scaling slopes are higher in frugivores than in folivores. A
   gross estimate of dietary quality explains much of the variation in V-b
   that is not explained by body size. Gape adaptations might favor
   habitually large bites for frugivores and small ones for folivores. More
   data are required for several feeding variables and for wild
   populations. Am J Phys Anthropol 142:625-635, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss,

Year = {2014},
Volume = {76},

Abstract = {Group-living folivorous primates can experience competition for food,
   and feeding competition has also been documented for solitarily foraging
   gummivorous and omnivorous primates. However, little is known about the
   types and consequences of feeding competition in solitary folivorous
   foragers. We conducted this study in the spiny forest of Berenty
   Reserve, southern Madagascar, to characterize the competitive regime of
   the nocturnal solitarily foraging white-footed sportive lemur (Lepilemur
   leucopus), a species that lives in dispersed pairs. We analyzed 1,213 hr
   of behavioral observations recorded simultaneously for the male and
   female of each of seven social units and recorded seasonal changes in
   food availability over a complete annual cycle. Lepilemur leucopus
   exhibited low selectivity in its dietary choice and mainly included the
   most abundant plant species in its diet. Contrary to our predictions, we
   did not find evidence for increased rates of contest (i.e., displacement
   from food trees) or scramble competition (i.e., shared use of food
   patches) during the lean season, neither within nor between social
   units. Instead, conflict rates were low throughout the year, and, during
   these observations, any feeding stress may have been more related to
   food quality than quantity. The resource defense hypotheses may not
   explain pair-living in this species as there was no indication that
   males defend food resources for their female pair-partners. The observed
   lack of feeding competition may indicate that a cryptic anti-predator
   strategy is a better predictor of spatial avoidance of pair-partners
   than conflict over food. While anti-predator benefits of crypsis may
   explain, at least partly, female-female avoidance, studies on the
   relationship between territory size/quality and reproductive success are
   required to understand whether feeding competition reduces the potential
   for female association in L. leucopus. (C) 2014 The Authors. American

Title = {Flexibility in positional behavior, strata use, and substrate

   to habitat fragmentation and degradation},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},

Abstract = {Studies of the effects of habitat fragmentation and degradation on
   primate positional behavior, strata use, and substrate utilization offer
   valuable insights into the behavioral and ecological flexibility of
   primates whose habitats have undergone extensive anthropogenic
   disturbance. In this study, we evaluated how positional behavior, strata
   use, and substrate utilization differed between Bale monkeys
   (Chlorocebus djamdjamensis)-bamboo-eating cercopithecids endemic to the
   southern Ethiopian Highlands-occupying continuous versus fragmented
   forests. Bale monkeys in forest fragments (where bamboo had been
   degraded or eradicated) spent significantly more time on the ground and
   in understory strata whereas those in continuous forest spent
   significantly more time in the middle and upper strata. Bale monkeys in
   forest fragments also spent significantly more time walking and
   galloping and significantly less time climbing than those in continuous
   forest. Our results suggest that, unlike the primarily arboreal Bale
   monkeys in continuous forest, Bale monkeys in forest fragments should be
   characterized as semi-terrestrial. In response to habitat disturbance in
   fragments, we observed a greater emphasis on terrestrial foraging and
   travel among Bale monkeys in these human altered habitats, which may put
   them at greater risk of predation and conflict with nearby human
   populations. Bale monkeys in fragments exhibit flexibility in their
   positional behavioral repertoire and their degree of terrestriality is
   more similar to their sister taxa in Chlorocebus than to Bale monkeys in
   continuous forest. These findings suggest that habitat alteration may
   compel Bale monkeys to exhibit semi-terrestrial behaviors crucial for
   their persistence in human-modified habitats. Our results contribute to
   a growing body of literature on primate behavioral responses to
   anthropogenic modification of their habitats and provide information
   that can contribute to the design of appropriate conservation management
   plans.},

Title = {The Use of Vanilla Plantations by Lemurs: Encouraging Findings for both
   Lemur Conservation and Sustainable Agroforestry in the Sava Region,
   Northeast Madagascar},

Abstract = {Extensive areas of forest are cleared every year to establish new
   agricultural land in the tropics, resulting in a catastrophic loss in
   habitat for the world's primates. A prominent example of this process is
   Madagascar, where an increasing demand for arable land has led to the
   once-forested landscape to be now dominated by agricultural areas used
   for the cultivation of food and cash crops. Despite the prominence of
   these plantations throughout Madagascar, their suitability as a habitat
   to support endemic lemur populations remains unclear. Here, we assessed
   lemur presence in vanilla plantations, Madagascar's principal export
   crop, within the northeastern Sava region with the use of line
   transects. We confirmed the presence of five lemur species, four of
   which were nocturnal cheirogaleids, in these vanilla plantations.
   Intensively farmed vanilla plantations and those in existing stands of
   vegetation supported at least one species of lemur. Furthermore, lemurs
   were significantly more likely to be present in plantations grown close
   or adjacent to natural forest fragments, compared to more intensively
   farmed, anthropogenic sites. In comparison, we observed eight lemur
   species in natural forest fragment sites in close proximity to the
   vanilla plantation sites, four of which we did not observe in any of the
   plantation sites. Our results provide evidence of lemurs using vanilla
   plantations and show that vanilla plantations may act as extensions of
   suitable habitat for lemurs, suggesting that they may also function as
   matrices between isolated forest fragments through which gene flow can
   occur. These are important and encouraging findings for both lemur
   conservation and for sustainable agroforestry undertaken by local
   farming communities.},

Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {177},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In a stochastic environment, long-term fitness can be influenced by
   variation, covariation, and serial correlation in vital rates (survival
   and fertility). Yet no study of an animal population has parsed the
   contributions of these three aspects of variability to long-term
   fitness. We do so using a unique database that includes complete
   life-history information for wild-living individuals of seven primate
   species that have been the subjects of long-term (22-45 years)
   behavioral studies. Overall, the estimated levels of vital rate
   variation had only minor effects on long-term fitness, and the effects
   of vital rate covariation and serial correlation were even weaker. To
   explore why, we compared estimated variances of adult survival in
   primates with values for other vertebrates in the literature and found
   that adult survival is significantly less variable in primates than it
   is in the other vertebrates. Finally, we tested the prediction that
   adult survival, because it more strongly influences fitness in a
   constant environment, will be less variable than newborn survival, and
   we found only mixed support for the prediction. Our results suggest that
   wild primates may be buffered against detrimental fitness effects of
   environmental stochasticity by their highly developed cognitive
   abilities, social networks, and broad, flexible diets.},

Abstract = {The number of adult males in a group is one of the most variable aspects
   of primate social organization. The causes for this variation have
   constituted a longstanding focus in primatological research.(1) As a
   male's reproductive success is mainly limited by access to females,(2)
   competition among males should result in the exclusion of rivals from
   groups of females.(4,5) However, a great number of primate species live
   in groups with several adult males. To explain the causes and
   consequences of this shared male group membership, primatologists have
   begun to examine the phenomenon within the framework of reproductive
   skew theory. This body of game theoretical models was developed to
   examine variation in reproductive skew within and across populations and
   species and to explain the preconditions for stable associations, as
   well as how reproduction should be distributed therein.(6-9) Here we
   summarize the main aspects of this theory, review its application to
   studies of male reproductive strategies, and identify pitfalls
   associated with using this approach.},

Abstract = {The health of 44 wild ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) at the Beza
   Mahafaly Special Reserve was assessed across three age classes: <5 yr
   (young), 5-9 yr (adult), and >= 10 yr (old). Hematology and biochemistry
   tests were performed manually (leukocyte count and differential, packed
   cell volume, total protein) and using a point-of-care analyzer
   (hematocrit, hemoglobin, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine,
   sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, total carbon dioxide,
   anion gap), respectively. Urine specific gravity was measured via
   refractometry. Age- and sex-related differences were detected. Old
   lemurs had significantly lower lymphocyte count than adult and young
   lemurs, leading to markedly lower total leukocyte count and higher
   neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Decreased lymphocyte count with advanced
   age is consistent with immunosenescence. Young lemurs had significantly
   higher total protein, monocyte count, and potassium than adult and old
   lemurs but significantly lower ionized calcium than adult lemurs. Males
   had significantly higher leukocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte counts;
   lower percentage basophils; and higher blood urea nitrogen than females.
   Females had markedly higher glucose than males. Young females had the
   highest monocyte count and total protein, which were significantly lower
   in the adult and old age classes. Basophil count was stable in females
   across age but dropped precipitously in males in the adult and old age
   classes. Within adult and old age classes, males had significantly
   higher blood urea nitrogen and lower basophils than females. Glucose was
   significantly higher after alpha 2 agonist administration. Identifying
   age-related hematologic and biochemical changes in apparently healthy
   wild ringtailed lemurs will aid in clinical diagnosis and treatment of
   lemurs in human care, which is especially relevant for management of
   geriatric animals in zoo populations. Equally important, a better
   understanding of the ability of aging lemurs to tolerate environmental
   stressors will inform the capacity for this species to cope with ongoing
   and future habitat alteration.},

Abstract = {In our commentary, we highlight several conceptual and methodological
   problems that have hampered broader integration of studies of collective
   group movements. Specifically, we argue that studies of captive animals
   should only be used to elucidate behavioural mechanisms. Moreover, the
   diversity of physical environments in which group movements occur as
   well as the social diversity of groups deserve more consideration in
   integrative studies. Furthermore, tests of predictions based on
   modelling studies are often hampered by the fact that models include
   variables that are difficult or impossible to measure in real animals.
   We also advocate the use of an empirical, rather than subjective
   establishment of operational definitions of group movements and the
   associated individual roles. Finally, we emphasize the utility of
   controlled experiments in the study of collective decision-making and
   group movements and encourage their wider application. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {We investigated how greater dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus major) densities,
   ambient air temperature, and dendrometrics (tree height and diameter)
   varied along forest edge-interior gradients in the Vohibola III
   Classified Forest in SE Madagascar. We also assessed if spatial
   variations in densities of Cheirogaleus major provide indirect evidence
   of increased predation pressure in the transition zone between edge and
   interior forest habitats, i.e., an ecological trap. We conducted diurnal
   temperature surveys (N = 394) and nocturnal surveys of Cheirogaleus
   major (N = 182) over 2 yr along 4 1250-m transects that ran
   perpendicular to the forest edge in Vohibola III. We did not see
   Cheirogaleus major from May to mid-September, and the highest sighting
   frequency occurred during October-November. Cheirogaleus major exhibited
   a negative edge response because densities ranged from low levels in
   edge habitats to higher levels in the forest interior. After we tested
   for spatial autocorrelation, edge-related variations in densities of
   Cheirogaleus major covaried most strongly with tree diameter. Edge
   responses of Cheirogaleus major may reflect spatial variations in fruit
   and liana abundance, though data are needed on the precise relationship
   between tree diameter and food production to confirm the relationship.
   Edge-related variations in densities of Cheirogaleus major may also
   provide indirect evidence of an ecological trap. Testing and controlling
   for spatial autocorrelation should be important components of future
   studies of primate conservation biology and ecology.},

Abstract = {Many species respond to heterospecific alarm calls, and the majority are
   social taxa and possess complex alarm calls themselves. Thus, the
   ability to respond to heterospecific alarm calls may be facilitated by
   possessing both these traits. Gunther's dik-dik (Madoqua guentheri) is a
   monogamous, territorial, and nonsocial miniature antelope with a simple
   vocal repertoire. Dik-diks are highly vulnerable to predation and could
   benefit from eavesdropping on heterospecific alarm calls. We broadcast
   recordings of white-bellied go-away bird (Corythaixoides leucogaster)
   alarm calls to dik-diks to test whether they could respond to
   heterospecific alarm calls. On hearing a go-away bird alarm call,
   dik-diks increased their likelihood to run to cover, decreased their
   foraging activity, increased their rate of head turning, and increased
   their period of vigilance compared with a nonthreatening bird song.
   Thus, predation risk alone, in the absence of complex sociality or
   complex communicative abilities, may be sufficient to drive the
   evolution of heterospecific eavesdropping.},

Title = {Demographic and life-history patterns in a population of ring-tailed
   lemurs (Lemur catta) at Beza Mahafaly Reserve, Madagascar: A 15-year
   perspective},

Abstract = {Over 15 field seasons (1987-2001), we collected census and life-history
   data on a population of individually identified ring-tailed lemurs at
   the Beza Mahafaly Reserve, Madagascar. No significant difference was
   found in population size over the study period, though a marked decline
   in the population occurred following a 2-year drought. The population
   rebounded rapidly after the immediate postdrought period. There was
   nearly a complete replacement of individuals over the study period.
   Average group size is 11.5 animals, and adult male to female sex ratio
   is 0.92. Most females reproduce annually, and the average fecundity rate
   is 84.3\%. The greatest variability in fecundity is found among old
   females. We suggest that ring-tailed lemur females follow an ``income
   breeding{''} strategy, i.e., females use maximum resources during
   reproduction rather than relying on fat stores, as do ``capital
   breeders.{''} Infant mortality to 1 year of age in a nondrought year is
   52\%, higher than infant mortality in small to medium-sized anthropoids.
   The oldest known female was 18 years old in 2001. We suggest that 18-20
   years may represent the maximum life-span for wild ring-tailed lemurs.
   Because males regularly emigrate from the population, we have no data
   regarding male life-span; however, there is some indication that males
   do not survive as long as females. Group fission has occurred three
   times: twice from one parent group living in the driest area of the
   reserve, with the most dispersed food resources. We suggest that the
   reproductive strategy that has evolved in this species, wherein females
   reproduce early in life and annually until old age, is a response to the
   unusual climate and environmental conditions under which Lemur catta has
   evolved. Am J Phys Anthropol 120: 182-194, 2003. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {Sexual dimorphism is common in polygynous species, where intrasexual
   competition is often thought to drive the evolution of large male body
   size, and in turn, male behavioral dominance over females. In
   Madagascar, the entire lemur radiation, which embraces diverse mating
   systems, lacks sexual dimorphism and exhibits frequent female dominance
   over males. The evolution of such morphological and behavioral
   peculiarities, often referred to as the lemur syndrome, has proven
   difficult to understand. Among other hypotheses, a potential role of
   intersexual selection has been repeatedly proposed but hardly ever
   tested. Here, we investigate whether female choice favors small and
   compliant males, and whether male choice favors large females in captive
   gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). Detailed analysis of a
   combination of behavioral observations and hormonal data available for
   both sexes shows that (1) females accept more matings from males with
   higher fighting abilities, (2) males adjust their investment in
   intrasexual competition to female fertility, and (3) both male and
   female strategies are weakly influenced by the body mass of potential
   partners, in directions contradicting our predictions. These results do
   not suggest a prominent role of intersexual selection in the evolution
   and maintenance of the lemur syndrome but rather point to alternative
   mechanisms relating to malemale competition, specifically highlighting
   an absence of relationship between male body mass and fighting ability.
   Finally, our findings add to the growing body of evidence suggesting
   flexible sex roles, by showing the expression of mutual mate choice in a
   female-dominant, sexually monomorphic and promiscuous primate. Am J Phys
   Anthropol, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation are significant threats for primate
   species worldwide. However, few attempts have been made to look for
   general patterns in primate responses to habitat loss and fragmentation,
   or whether these may be associated with species' traits. We conducted a
   review of published literature on effects of patch size to quantify the
   effect of a reduction in this predictor on primates, and to determine
   whether these effects depend on species' traits. The effects of patch
   size on seven response variables (density, parasite prevalence and
   diversity, presence, genetic diversity, time spent feeding, resting and
   movement), were extracted from 135 papers and compared across six
   species traits (diet specialisation, social structure, body size, home
   range size, group size and dispersal ability). We found that density,
   parasitic prevalence and diversity and time spent feeding were
   positively associated with a reduction in patch size, while species'
   presence and genetic diversity were negatively associated. Time spent
   resting and moving did not show clear patterns. We found little evidence
   that the effect of patch size varies consistently with traits. This
   study provides important evidence for the consistent effect of patch
   size on a range of factors that influence the dynamics of primate
   populations. However, there is a need to move beyond quantifying patch
   size effects alone and to quantify the effects of changes occurring at
   broader landscape scales. This would allow more holistic primate
   conservation strategies to be developed across whole landscapes rather
   than being focussed on the management of individual patches.},

Title = {Ranging behavior and possible correlates of pair-living in southeastern

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {153-171},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Researchers have proposed several hypotheses to explain pair-living in
   primates. In particular, when males are not involved in direct parental
   care, pair-living may be related to female dispersal, infanticide
   prevention, or male mate/resource defense. We aimed to evaluate, through
   a better understanding of the ranging patterns of avahis, which
   hypotheses may best account for pair-living in these nocturnal lemurs.
   We collected focal observations over 26 nights, June-September 2004, in
   a littoral forest (Sainte Luce, southeastern Madagascar) on 4 adult
   radiocollared avahis {[}Avahi laniger (Tattersall, I. (1982). The
   Primates of Madagascar. Columbia University Press, New York.) or Avahi
   meridionalis (Zaramody in Primate Reports 74:9-22, 2006)]. We followed 2
   males and 2 females from 2 groups: B, a male-female couple, and A,
   comprising the parental pair and 1-yr-old female offspring. The adult
   females birthed in August. We recorded resting and feeding tree points
   (via global positioning system) for home range calculation through
   minimum convex polygon and kernel methods. We provide the first
   quantitative information on the ranging behavior of 2 male and 2 female
   avahis. Home range/daily path length values (means) are higher than the
   ones previously reported for the same and other folivorous pair-living
   lemur species. On average, the 2 females spent more time feeding and
   traveled shorter distances than the 2 males did. Male-female cohesion
   (mean values), possibly enhanced by offspring presence, was higher in A
   and after births than in B and before births, respectively. Although
   male avahis may be forced into pair-living owing to energy constraints
   related to size, locomotion, and diet, females might accept pair-living
   in exchange for indirect territory defense and mate guarding.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1209-1218},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Recent theory in social evolution has been mainly concerned with
   competition and cooperation within social groups of animals and their
   impact on the stability of those groups. Much less attention has been
   paid to conflicts arising as a result of solitary floaters (outsiders)
   attempting to join groups of established residents (insiders). We model
   such conflicts over group-membership using a demographically explicit
   approach in which the rates of births and deaths in a population
   determine the availability of group-vacancies and the number of floaters
   competing over these vacancies. We find that the outcome of within-group
   competition, reflected in the partitioning of reproduction among group
   members, exerts surprisingly little influence on the resolution of
   insider-outsider conflict. The outcome of such conflict is also largely
   unaffected by differences in resource holding potential between insiders
   and outsiders. By contrast, whether or not groups form is mainly
   determined by demographic factors (variation in vital rates such as
   fecundity and mortality) and the resulting population dynamics. In
   particular, at high floater densities territory defense becomes too
   costly, and groups form because insiders give in to the intruder
   pressure imposed on them by outsiders. We emphasize the importance of
   insider-outsider conflicts in social evolution theory and highlight
   avenues for future research.},

Abstract = {Infanticide by males has been hypothesized to be a naturally selected
   behavioral strategy that increases the infanticidal male's reproductive
   success. The sexual selection hypothesis has been challenged via
   alternative, nonadaptive hypotheses that dispute its empirical and
   theoretical bases. Two of the most widely recognized alternatives are
   the social pathology hypothesis, in which infanticide results from
   overcrowding or recent human disturbance, and the generalized aggression
   hypothesis, in which infanticide is an epiphenomenon of increased male
   aggression. We report the first case of infanticide in wild, seasonally
   breeding patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas) living at a low population
   density in a stable habitat, conditions which do not support the social
   pathology hypothesis. Its exceptional occurrence is consistent with the
   sexual selection hypothesis: over a 7-year period the infanticidal male
   was the only one of 13 resident males that was not present during the
   actual conception season but was present during the following birth
   season. Also consistent with this hypothesis, mothers were
   differentially targeted for male aggression, which increased sevenfold
   during the days surrounding the infanticide and then decreased to
   baseline levels after the infanticide. Aggression targeted at mothers
   does not support the generalized aggression hypothesis. As predicted by
   the sexual selection hypothesis, females began soliciting mating
   immediately after the infanticide, despite its occurrence in the

Abstract = {In group-living Malagasy primates (Lemuriformes), certain demographic
   and morphological traits deviate both from theoretical expectations
   derived from sexual selection theory and from patterns in better-known
   anthropoid primates. Lemurs lack sexual dimorphism in body and canine
   size and live in relatively small multimale-multifemale groups with, on
   average, even adult sex ratios, despite a polygynous mating system. In
   addition, the majority of gregarious lemurs are cathemeral, that is,
   they are regularly active both day and night. The social system of
   cathemeral lemurs has been considered an adaptation to their activity
   pattern. If so, groups should consist of multiple pairs that aggregate
   during diurnal activity and range separately at night in response to
   predation and infanticide risk, respectively. Moreover, mating
   privileges should exist between pair partners. We tested this hypothesis
   with data collected on two groups of wild redfronted lemurs in western
   Madagascar during 1023 focal animal hours spanning 4 months including
   the mating season. In addition, data on spatial relations were collected
   on 12 nights. We found no differences in group cohesion between day and
   night and no behavioural evidence for multiple male-female pairs.
   Instead, one male in each group monopolized social interactions with all
   females. However, females copulated with all resident males, although
   most often with the central male. Thus, basic predictions df the
   cathemerality hypothesis are unsupported. Multiple matings and
   indications of oestrous synchrony can be viewed as female
   counterstrategies against infanticide, whereas reproductive strategies
   of redfronted lemur males remain obscure. (C) 1999 The Association for
   the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Title = {Home range size in the blue-eyed black lemur (Eulemur flavifrons): A
   comparison between dry and wet seasons},
Journal = {MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY},

Volume = {76},

Abstract = {Western Madagascar is subjected to a long, dry winter season which
   coincides with food scarcity. We investigated the effect of this
   seasonal variation in food availability on the home ranges of blue-eyed
   black lemurs (Eulemur flavifrons) in the Sahamalaza-Iles Radama National
   Park, north-western Madagascar. It was expected that home range would
   increase and overlap more in the dry season. The study was conducted in
   an area of dry rainforest from September 2006 to March 2008 with five
   lemur groups. Animals were located by direct observation and
   geographical locations recorded to determine the daily path length and
   the home range sizes of the study groups in the respective seasons.
   Daily path length and home range size varied significantly between
   seasons. Daily path length was significantly greater in the dry season
   (673.4 +/- 539.2 m) than in the wet season (423.6 +/- 183.2 m). Home
   ranges overlapped between groups in both seasons, but were significantly
   larger during the dry season (MCP: 7.5 +/- 6.6 ha, 95\% Kernel: 8.5 +/-
   6.6 ha) than in the wet season (MCP: 3.0 +/- 1.6 ha, 95\% Kernel: 4.1
   +/- 1.6 ha). There was no clear relationship between home range size and
   group size in either the dry or the wet season. Seasonal changes in home
   range area are likely to be a consequence of reduced food availability
   in the dry season. Compared to other primates, including some lemur
   species, the home range size of the blue-eyed black lemur is relatively
   small. (C) 2010 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published by

Abstract = {Morphological and behavioural traits which improve agonistic power are
   subject to intrasexual selection and, at the proximate level, are
   influenced by circulating androgens. Because intrasexual selection in
   mammals is more intense among males, they typically dominate females.
   Female social dominance is therefore unexpected and, indeed, I arc.
   Ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) are sexually monomorphic primates ill
   which all adult fc males dominate all males. The goal of our study was
   to test the prediction that female dominance in this species is
   associated with high androgen levels. Using two captive groups, we
   collected data on agonistic behaviour and non-invasively assessed their
   androgen concentrations in faeces and saliva Ly enzyme immunoassay. We
   found that adult female L. catta do not have higher androgen levels than
   males. However, during the mating season there was a twofold increase in
   both the androgen levels and conflict rates among females. This seasonal
   increase in their androgen levels was probably not due to a general
   increase ill ovarian hormone production because those females showing
   the strongest signs of follicular development tended to have low
   androgen concentrations. At the individual level neither the individual
   aggression rates nor the proportion of same-sexed individuals dominated
   were correlated with their. androgen levels. We conclude that female
   dominance in ring-tailed lemurs is neither based on physical superiority
   nor. on high androgen levels and that it is equally important to study
   male subordination and prenatal brain priming effects for a complete
   understanding of this phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Endocrine profiles were investigated in wild and captive mongoose lemurs
   (Eulemur mongoz; Lemuridae) by analysing faecal progestagens and
   oestrogens. Oestrous cycle characterization was not possible, as most
   females appeared to conceive during the first oestrus of the breeding
   season. Conception was preceded by a pseudo-oestrus with no discernible
   luteal phase. Pseudo-oestrus and oestrus identification was possible by
   investigating the oestrogen : progestagen ratio. Pregnancy was reliably
   determined approximately 47 days after conception, when progestagen and
   oestrogen excretion increased above breeding season concentrations.
   Gestation was further characterized by high progestagen concentrations
   and a decline in oestrogen excretion 70-80 days after conception. Post
   partum, progestagens declined, but oestrogen excretion increased to
   exceed breeding season concentrations. In the wild group, a nulliparous
   daughter conceived while still a member of her natal group and aborted
   after 70-80 days of pregnancy at which time progestagens had declined
   but oestrogens remained high. Comparisons with other strepsirhine
   primates suggest that pseudo-oestrus followed by conception at first
   oestrus may be prevalent in lemurs. Gestational progesterone profiles
   Vary between species, but a delayed increase in oestrogens during
   pregnancy could be common to all strepsirhines, although oestrogen
   levels during the final trimester of pregnancy differ between lemurs and
   lorises. Methodological investigations showed that prolonged storage of
   faeces in ethanol is viable and that the presence of undigested
   vegetable matter in the faecal pellets had no effect on the
   interpretation of hormone profiles.},

Abstract = {In the Malagasy ecosystem one particular animal group, lemurs, have the
   greatest biomass and species richness of frugivores. The peak fruit
   production in the Malagasy rain forests is about three months shorter
   compared to peak fruit production in the Amazon and the African rain
   forests. This suggests that the environment in Madagascar has more
   well-defined constraints than other continental areas with primates. In
   Ranomafana National Park, both the overall number of trees, and the
   number of tree species producing fruit drops during winter months.
   Particularly in large-bodied lemurs such as sifakas, drop in fruit
   availability corresponds to an increase in leaf eating. In addition to
   dietary shifts, all lemur species appear to be able to deal with the
   season of scarce fruit availability by conserving energy. Extreme
   responses to winter season are seen in small-bodied lemurs which go into
   hibernation up to six months every year. Unlike many primate communities
   in other continents, lemurs do not have synchronous birth peaks across
   species. In Ranomafana sympatric lemurs show that while individuals
   within a species have synchronized births, across species lemurs have
   synchronized weaning. The weaning synchrony coincides with maximum fruit
   availability and production of small fruits peaks when small juvenile
   lemurs begin to forage independently. These patterns suggest that lemurs
   do not appear to rely on fruits to carry them over the period of food
   scarcity as would be expected from classical descriptions of keystone
   resources. Rather, we propose that lemurs as a guild rely on fruits as a
   keystone resource during the warm, wet months in order for lactation and
   weaning to succeed. Many of the fruit tree species used by lemurs are
   also hardwood species favored by selective loggers. While loss of these
   key fruit trees may not drive lemurs into extinction immediately, it may
   adversely affect reproductive success years after logging.},

Abstract = {By extracting steroid metabolites from feces, researchers can track
   endocrine activity noninvasively in free-ranging animals. Sample
   preservation is a critical component of such methods because steroid
   metabolites rapidly decompose. Here, we describe a method for
   preservation, field extraction, and radioimmunoassay of steroid
   metabolites (estradiol, progesterone, glucocorticoids, and testosterone)
   from the feces of wild female baboons (Papio spp.). This method is a
   modification of that developed by Stavisky {[}Socioendocrinology:
   noninvasive techniques for monitoring reproductive function in captive
   and free-ranging primates. PhD, Emory University, 1994.], which employs
   reversed-phase octadecylsilane cartridges to extract steroids from
   feces. In addition to providing physiological validation for this
   method, we examine variation in steroid concentration across different
   (1) collection times (morning vs. afternoon), (2) methanol extraction
   treatments (homogenized vs. hand-mixed), and (3) solid-phase extraction
   times (2 vs. 10 h after collection). We then examine the stability of
   sample storage at ambient and subzero temperatures to determine whether
   storage time significantly alters steroid concentrations. Our results
   show that hormone concentrations do not differ between morning and
   afternoon samples, homogenization yields significantly higher fecal
   steroid concentrations, and fecal steroids are stable in a
   methanol/acetone solution for up to 10 h. When stored at ambient
   temperatures, only glucocorticoid metabolites had some degradation over
   a period of up to 40 days. However, when stored at -10degreesC, no
   significant steroid changes were observed for up to 400 days. This
   method is particularly suited for behavioral research because it permits
   delays between sample collection and sample processing, thus allowing
   behavioral observations to continue. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The reproductive cycle of several lemur species is synchronized by
   photoperiodic changes and it is attuned to the seasonal fluctuations in
   food supply. Nevertheless, irregular periods of food shortage occur in
   Madagascar, which can result in a negative energy balance and reduced
   fitness, especially in frugivorous species. Here, we tested whether
   ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) and brown lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons x
   collaris) use fat stores to maintain their energy balance in a gallery
   forest of Madagascar (Berenty Reserve). We assessed the energy intake
   from weight-based estimates of food intake (mouthful count) and
   macronutrient contents in the diet during dry and wet months. The
   metabolizable energy ingested by these frugivorous/folivorous species
   was high during the late wet season, but it was insufficient to meet
   their energy requirements during the dry season. These preliminary data
   suggest that these lemurs must store sufficient amount of fat mass
   during the period of food abundance to meet their maintenance
   requirements and to cope with the energetic burden of the mating season.
   Estimates based on models assuming no fiber digestibility during the dry
   season are consistent with the prediction that brown lemurs should
   supplement their daytime diet with nighttime feeding in addition to the
   use of body fat stores.},

Abstract = {The gut microbiomes of mammals appear to mirror their hosts' phylogeny,
   suggesting host-driven microbial community assembly. Yet, much of this
   evidence stems from comparative studies of distinct wild or captive
   populations that lack data for disentangling the relative influences of
   shared phylogeny and environment. Here, we present phylogenetic and
   multivariate analyses of gut microbiomes from six sympatric (i.e.,
   co-occurring) mammal species inhabiting a 1-km(2) area in western
   Madagascar-three lemur and three non-primate species-that consider
   genetic, dietary, and ecological predictors of microbiome functionality
   and composition. Host evolutionary history, indeed, appears to shape gut
   microbial patterns among both closely and distantly related species.
   However, we also find that diet-reliance on leaves versus fruit-is the
   best predictor of microbiome similarity among closely related lemur
   species, and that host substrate use-ground versus tree-constrains
   horizontal transmission via incidental contact with feces, with arboreal
   species harboring far more distinct communities than those of their
   terrestrial and semi-terrestrial counterparts.},

Title = {Total Energy Expenditure and Body Composition in Two Free-Living
   Sympatric Lemurs},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Background: Evolutionary theories that account for the unusual
   socio-ecological traits and life history features of group-living
   prosimians, compared with other primates, predict behavioral and
   physiological mechanisms to conserve energy. Low energy output and
   possible fattening mechanisms are expected, as either an adaptive
   response to drastic seasonal fluctuations of food supplies in
   Madagascar, or persisting traits from previously nocturnal hypometabolic
   ancestors. Free ranging ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) and brown
   lemurs (Eulemur sp.) of southern Madagascar have different
   socio-ecological characteristics which allow a test of these theories:
   Both gregarious primates have a phytophagous diet but different
   circadian activity rhythms, degree of arboreality, social systems, and
   slightly different body size.
   Methodology and Results: Daily total energy expenditure and body
   composition were measured in the field with the doubly labeled water
   procedure. High body fat content was observed at the end of the rainy
   season, which supports the notion that individuals need to attain a
   sufficient physical condition prior to the long dry season. However,
   ring-tailed lemurs exhibited lower water flux rates and energy
   expenditure than brown lemurs after controlling for body mass
   differences. The difference was interpreted to reflect higher efficiency
   for coping with seasonally low quality foods and water scarcity. Daily
   energy expenditure of both species was much less than the field
   metabolic rates predicted by various scaling relationships found across
   mammals.
   Discussion: We argue that low energy output in these species is mainly
   accounted for by low basal metabolic rate and reflects adaptation to
   harsh, unpredictable environments. The absence of observed sex
   differences in body weight, fat content, and daily energy expenditure
   converge with earlier investigations of physical activity levels in
   ring-tailed lemurs to suggest the absence of a relationship between
   energy constraints and the evolution of female dominance over males
   among lemurs. Nevertheless, additional seasonal data are required to
   provide a definitive conclusion.},

Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Pages = {187-197},
Abstract = {In Bateman's' landmark experiments, he placed male and female fruit
   flies in bottles with varying numbers of opposite-sex mates. Male
   production of offspring increased with increasing numbers of female
   mates, but female production of offspring did not increase with
   increasing numbers of male mates. This phenomenon was caused by a
   fundamental reproductive difference between the sexes: Fertilization and
   gestation occur in the female, which limits her maximum reproductive
   output compared to that of males.(2) From an adaptationist perspective,
   this insight led to the generalization that males should mate
   indiscriminately, whereas females should be more discriminating.
   Empirical observation has not supported the generalization that females
   are always so choosy, however. In a wide variety of animals, females are
   known to mate with multiple partners.(3.4)},

Title = {Territory exclusivity and intergroup encounters in the indris (Mammalia:
   Primates: Indridae: Indri indri) upon methodological tuning},
Journal = {EUROPEAN ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {84},
Number = {1},
Pages = {238-251},
Abstract = {Territorial, socially monogamous species actively defend their home
   range against conspecifics to maintain exclusive access to resources
   such as food or mates. Primates use scent marks and loud calls to signal
   territory occupancy and limit the risk of intergroup encounters,
   maximizing their energetic balance. Indri indri is a little-studied
   territorial, socially monogamous singing primate living in family
   groups. The groups announce territory occupancy with long-distance
   calls, and actively defend their territories from conspecific intruders.
   This work includes data collected in three forests in Madagascar on 16
   indri groups over up to 5 years. We aimed (1) to estimate the extent of
   territories using minimum convex polygon (MCP), implementing minimum
   sampling effort requirements; (2) to quantify territorial exclusivity,
   measuring the overlap between territories; and (3) to evaluate the
   intergroup encounter rate and to quantify the dynamics of group
   encounters. Our results showed that indris range evenly within exclusive
   small territories with no or little overlap. Intergroup encounters are
   rare (0.05 encounters per day), and are located on the periphery of the
   territories. Disputes were mostly solved with vocal confrontation and
   only in 13\% of the cases ended in physical fights. This frame
   underlines a cost-benefit explanation of territoriality, favouring a
   strategy that efficiently limits overlap and avoids costly intergroup
   encounters. We hypothesize that territorial behaviour in indri is
   related to mate-guarding strategy and that vocal behaviour plays a
   fundamental role in regulating intergroup spacing dynamics.},

Title = {Special relationships instead of female dominance for redfronted lemurs,
   Eulemur fulvus rufus},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {239-258},
Abstract = {Most lemurs yet studied in detail exhibit some mode of adult female
   social dominance over males. The known exception, a brown lemur
   subspecies known as rufous or redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus),
   forms multimale-multifemale social groups within which unambiguous
   dominance relations are not observed among adults. Resting groups of
   redfronted lemurs consistently include huddling adult male-female pairs
   whose males selectively scentmark and rub their heads in the scentmarks
   of their female huddling partners. Quantitative observations confirmed
   that some of these male-female pairs maintain special relationships
   satisfying all criteria originally developed in research on
   cercopithecine monkeys. Observations before, during, and after mating
   season, intergroup encounters, male transfers, and changes in
   male-female affiliations illuminated developmental and functional
   aspects of male-female partnerships. Each adult female in two
   semi-free-ranging study groups shared high rates of association,
   grooming, and agonistic support and low rates of agonistic interaction
   with one unrelated or distantly related adult male partner. Such
   affinity characterized small proportions of adult male-female
   relationships. Several males directed not only support but also
   aggression toward adult females with whom they sought to affiliate. All
   bonded males sought to copulate with their partners, and some appeared
   to ignore estrus in nonpartners. All females accepted copulation
   attempts from partners and some seemed to prefer their partners as
   mates. Partial synchronization of brief estrus periods together with
   concealed ovulation appeared to minimize chances for polygynous mating.
   Results support the view that the male-female pair is the fundamental
   social unit of E. fulvus and suggest that female partnership with
   individual males obviates dominance behavior, including female
   dominance, in this lemurid primate. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Large body size has evolved repeatedly in the order Primates, not merely
   among anthropoids but also among prosimians. Whereas high degrees of
   sexual size dimorphism characterize many of the large-bodied
   anthropoids, this is not the case for extinct large-bodied lemurs. This
   paper uses finite mixture analysis and other techniques to ascertain
   just how much skull length dimorphism might be embedded in the generally
   unimodal distributions of skull lengths of giant extinct lemurs from
   single localities, and then compares these results with known skull
   length dimorphisms in extant lemurs and large-bodied catarrhines. We
   show that low levels of skull length sexual dimorphism (or none at all)
   characterize subfossil lemurs, and we explore several possible
   explanations for this phenomenon. Traditional explanations of sexual
   size dimorphism generally focus on body size or mating systems. These
   are not sufficient to explain the variation in sexual dimorphism that
   can be observed in the order Primates.},

   reconciliation would provide an immediate positive feedback that is
   probably independent of the quality of the relationship between

Title = {Sex and seasonal differences in aggression and steroid secretion in
   Lemur catta: Are socially dominant females hormonally `masculinized'?},

Abstract = {Female social dominance characterizes many strepsirrhine primates
   endemic to Madagascar, but currently there is no comprehensive
   explanation for how or why female lemurs routinely dominate males.
   Reconstructing the evolutionary pressures that may have shaped female
   dominance depends on better understanding the mechanism of inheritance,
   variation in trait expression, and correlating variables. Indeed,
   relative to males, many female lemurs also display delayed puberty, size
   monomorphism, and `masculinized' external genitalia. As in the spotted
   hyena (Crocuta crocuta), a species characterized by extreme
   masculinization of the female, this array of traits focuses attention on
   the role of androgens in female development. Consequently, I examined
   endocrine profiles and social interaction in the ringtailed lemur (Lemur
   catta) to search for a potential source of circulating androgen in adult
   females and an endocrine correlate of female dominance or its proxy,
   aggression. I measured serum androstenedione (A(4)), testosterone (T),
   and estradiol (E-2) in reproductively intact, adult lemurs (10 females;
   12 males) over four annual cycles. Whereas T concentrations in males far
   exceeded those in females, A(4) concentrations were only slightly
   greater in males than in females. In both sexes, A(4) and T were
   positively correlated, implicating the Delta(4)-biosynthetic pathway.
   Moreover, seasonal changes in reproductive function in both sexes
   coincided with seasonal changes in behavior, with A(4) and T in males
   versus A(4) and E-2 in females increasing during periods marked by
   heightened aggression. Therefore, A4 and/or E2 may be potentially
   important steroidal sources in female lemurs that could modulate
   aggression and underlie a suite of masculinized features. (c) 2007

Title = {Assessment of Male Reproductive Skew via Highly Polymorphic STR Markers
   in Wild Vervet Monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus},

Volume = {109},

Abstract = {Male reproductive strategies have been well studied in primate species
   where the ability of males to monopolize reproductive access is high.
   Less is known about species where males cannot monopolize mating access.
   Vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) are interesting in this regard
   as female codominance reduces the potential for male monopolization.
   Under this condition, we assessed whether male dominance rank still
   influences male mating and reproductive success, by assigning
   paternities to infants in a population of wild vervets in the Eastern
   Cape, South Africa. To determine paternity, we established
   microsatellite markers from noninvasive fecal samples via cross-species
   amplification. In addition, we evaluated male mating and reproductive
   success for 3 groups over 4 mating seasons. We identified 21 highly
   polymorphic microsatellites (number of alleles = 7.5 +/- 3.1 {[}mean +/-
   SD], observed heterozygosity = 0.691 +/- 0.138 {[}mean +/- SD]) and
   assigned paternity to 94 of 97 sampled infants (96.9\%) with high
   confidence. Matings pooled over 4 seasons were significantly skewed
   across 3 groups, although skew indices were low (B index = 0.023-0.030)
   and mating success did not correlate with male dominance. Paternities
   pooled over 4 seasons were not consistently significantly skewed (B
   index = 0.005-0.062), with high-ranking males siring more offspring than
   subordinates only in some seasons. We detected 6 cases of extra-group
   paternity (6.4\%) and 4 cases of natal breeding (4.3\%). Our results
   suggest that alternative reproductive strategies besides priority of
   access for dominant males are likely to affect paternity success,
   warranting further investigation into the determinants of paternity
   among species with limited male monopolization potential.},

Abstract = {Because ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) are a female-dominant,
   female-philopatric species in which the females provide the majority of
   parental care and troop defense, resource defense is a possible function
   of female lemur scent marking. To test this hypothesis, I conducted
   three studies. First, I presented captive, individually housed females
   with a series of samples of female scent, each from a different female,
   to determine whether they would respond to those samples and
   discriminate between them. Second, I reanalyzed data from a focal animal
   study of four females in two adjacent troops in Berenty Reserve,
   Madagascar, to determine female marking rates before, during, and after
   the mating season, and to clarify the relationship among positions of
   feeding, intertroop defense, and scent marking. The third study was
   based on ad libitum observations of the sniffing and marking behavior of
   a troop in Berenty Reserve during a year when they traveled far out of
   their home range. The females in study I investigated female scent
   samples but provided no evidence that they discriminated between them.
   In study 2 the wild females marked throughout the study and did not
   limit their marking to the mating season. They deposited significantly
   more of their marks in a zone of confrontation with adjacent troops,
   where they also did the majority of their feeding, and they increased
   their rate of marking during agonistic intertroop confrontations. The
   females determined the positions of their scent marks and deposited the
   first mark in the majority of counter-marking sequences. When the
   females traveled out of their defended range in study 3, they
   significantly decreased their rate of marking and increased their rate
   of sniffing spots but not marking them. All evidence gathered so far
   supports the hypothesis that one function of female ring-tailed lemur
   scent marking is to provide intergroup information that is then used to
   reinforce the border of the defended resource.},

Abstract = {It is currently recognized that the method used to collect phenology
   data can affect the resulting pattern. However to dare, the underlying
   influences have not been examined. To examine potential methodological
   biases, we investigated the effects of phenological method, sample size,
   and species composition on phenological patterns using data collected to
   estimate food availability for three primate species in Ranomafana
   National Park, Madagascar. Two phenological methods were compared:
   selected tree observations and systematic transect monitoring. By
   generating bootstrapped subsamples derived from the transect tree data
   set, we simulated two selected tree data sets and subsequently compared
   the observed and bootstrapped values. Although the observed values fell
   within the bootstrapped confidence intervals, suggesting no significant
   effects of sampling protocol or sample size, additional lines of
   evidence suggest otherwise. Observed samples composed of different plant
   species; whether based on species attributes such as life-form or
   categories such as food versus nonfood planes, consistently produced
   different phenological patterns. Wide confidence intervals of the
   bootstrapped samples indicate high individual variation in reproductive
   activity within the species sampled. Finally, we compared how well the
   selected tree and the transect methods represented food items used by
   all three primate species studied and found that transect methods
   sampled a wider diversity of food items, including rare foods, and a
   higher percentage of main primate food items than selected tree methods.},

Year = {2002},
Volume = {52},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine effects of seasonal and social
   factors on male androgen excretion in a seasonally breeding primate
   living in multi-male-multi-female groups. By combining detailed
   behavioural observations (>2,500 h) on 3 groups of redfronted lemurs
   living in Kirindy Forest/Madagascar with non-invasive hormone analysis
   of >800 faecal samples collected concomitantly from the same animals, we
   tested predictions on: (1) the effect of social status on immunoreactive
   testosterone (iT) excretion; (2) seasonal variation of iT across
   reproductive periods; and (3) the relationship between aggression and iT
   excretion. The study lasted 14 months, covering two mating and one birth
   season. The results revealed that males fall into two distinct social
   classes, with one dominant male and several subordinate males in each
   group. In contrast to our prediction, the behavioural differences
   between these two classes were not reflected by differences in androgen
   levels, making physiological suppression of testicular function an
   unlikely mechanism of male reproductive competition. As expected for a
   seasonally breeding animal, iT values were elevated during the mating
   season. Androgen levels tracked the increase in the rate of reproductive
   aggression during the mating season as predicted by the challenge
   hypothesis. An increase in aggression due to spontaneous social
   instability outside the mating season, however, was not linked to a
   parallel rise of iT. Furthermore, the highest iT levels were obtained
   during the birth season, which may be part of a male strategy to remain
   aggressive during this period of high infanticide risk. These findings
   suggest that redfronted lemurs do not respond with increases in
   androgens to short-term challenges and that high androgen levels instead
   correlate with longer-lasting and predictable situations, such as the
   mating and birth seasons.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Benefits of group life depend in large part on whether animals remain
   cohesive, which often requires collective decisions about where and when
   to move. During a group movement, the leader may be considered as the
   individual occupying the vanguard position of the group progression,
   when its movement evokes following by other group members. In
   nondespotic societies, individuals with greater incentives to move
   frequently are leaders. During 15 months of observations (1,712 contact
   hours), we investigated two mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata)
   groups at La Flor de Catemaco (Los Tuxtlas, Mexico) to examine whether
   sex and female reproductive state influenced leadership likelihood in
   two contexts: movements toward feeding trees; movements associated with
   loud calls, a group-defense behavior used by males of this genus.
   Females led and occupied forward positions during group movements toward
   feeding trees more often than adult males. Adult females led these
   movements more frequently when they were gestating than when they were
   lactating or cycling. There were no differences between sexes in the
   leadership of group movements associated with loud calls. Leadership by
   gestating females is perhaps the result of their higher
   nutritional/energetic needs when compared with cycling females, and of
   their greater mobility when compared with lactating females carrying
   dependent offspring. Female leadership during movements toward feeding
   trees may be a mechanism to optimize access to food resources in mantled
   howler monkeys.},

Title = {Genetic Evidence for Male and Female Dispersal in Wild Lemur catta},

Abstract = {Lemur catta has traditionally been considered a species with male-biased
   dispersal; however, occasional female dispersal occurs. Using molecular
   data, we evaluated dispersal patterns in 2 L. catta populations in
   southwestern Madagascar: Tsinnanampesotse National Park (TNP) and Beza
   Mahafaly Special Reserve (BMSR). We also investigated the genetic
   differentiation between the populations and dispersal partner
   relatedness. Results showed minor genetic differentiation between the
   populations (theta(ST) = 0.039), which may indicate gene flow
   historically occurring in this region, made possible by the presence of
   L. catta groups between the sites. Different patterns of sex-biased
   dispersal were found between the sites using corrected assignment
   indices: male-biased dispersal in TNP, and a lack of sex-biased
   dispersal in BMSR. Observational evidence of female dispersal in BMSR
   supports these results and may imply intense female resource competition
   in and around BMSR, because small groups of 2-3 females have been
   observed dispersing within BMSR and entering the reserve from outside.
   These dispersing groups largely consisted of mothers transferring with
   daughters, although we have an aunt-niece pair transferring together.
   Genetic data suggest that males also transfer with relatives. Our data
   demonstrate that dispersal partners consist of same-sexed kin for L.
   catta males and females, highlighting the importance of kin selection.

Abstract = {Latrine behavior, or the preferential, repeated use of 1 or more
   specific defecation sites, is well known among mammals and believed to
   function in olfactory communication among individuals or groups in many
   circumstances. Primates have reduced their capacity for olfaction in
   favor of more developed visual systems; however, several prosimian
   primates regularly use olfactory communication for transmission of
   social signals, most often using scent gland secretions and urine.
   Latrine behaviors have been described rarely in primates and have
   traditionally not been included in reviews of primate olfactory
   communication, yet we found ample evidence that certain primate species
   habitually use latrine sites for defecation. Here we review the previous
   evidence for latrine use in primates and report new and more extensive
   observations of latrine use in 2 lemuriform primates (Lepilemur sp. and
   Hapalemur griseus). Based on these new observations, we present and
   evaluate 4 available hypotheses for the function of latrines
   (advertisement of sexual cycling, predation avoidance, intragroup
   spacing, and intergroup resource defense) in lemur taxa for which
   sufficient evidence of latrine use exists. In all cases, intergroup
   resource defense is the function most consistent with available
   observations.},

Title = {Male Aggression During Mating: Evidence for Sexual Coercion in a Female

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {70},
Number = {12},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this article we document male sexual coercion of a Lemur catta Female
   on St. Catherines Island (SCI), USA. Data presented in this paper were
   collected on one free-ranging L. catta group during October-November
   2002 using all-occurrences sampling for agonism and reproductive
   behavior. We observed a male forcefully attempting to mate with a
   year-old estrous female. Despite the fact that we observed this female
   to present to the male during her estrus, throughout the episode the
   male employed the use of force, and achieved penile intromission on at
   least one occasion while the Female struggled and resisted. We interpret
   his behavior as sexual coercion. As measured by sexual presents, the
   female appeared to more strongly prefer two other males as mates, yet
   each of these males gait-led Fewer mounts and less cumulative tin-le
   spent in mounts than the coercive male. The coercive male was one of two
   group males with the lowest observed mating success, suggesting that
   coercion might be a strategy used by males who are not highly sexually
   preferred. Females undergo early sexual maturation at this site owing to
   provisioning, and can therefore enter estrus before Fully attaining
   dominance over males. As such, these data suggest that one consequence
   of provisioning a wild L. catta population (or of maintaining L. catta
   in captivity) may be that young females can be the targets of sexual
   coercion if they reach sexual maturity before Fully achieving social
   dominance over males. In conclusion, male sexual coercion can occur in
   L. catta despite the Female dominance characteristic of this species,
   and can constrain the mating behavior of females. Am. J. Primatol.

Abstract = {Following the introduction of DNA fingerprinting in the 1980s, studies
   have repeatedly revealed mismatches between the mating system inferred
   from social behaviour and the mating system revealed through genetic
   relationships. In this study, we examined the occurrence of extragroup
   paternities (EGPs) in gelada monkeys at Guassa, Ethiopia and explored
   how EGPs may be acquired in this species, which is conventionally
   considered to have a single breeding male ({''}leader{''}) per social
   group ({''}unit{''}). We found that while leaders sired most offspring,
   a substantial proportion (17 of 88 offspring, 19\%) were sired by
   extra-unit males. Offspring were more likely to be sired by extra-unit
   males when they were: (1) conceived in the 6 months following the start
   of peak rainfall (July-December) and (2) the first successful conception
   for a mother. Furthermore, eight of the 17 extra-unit paternities were
   directly or indirectly the result of a single infertile leader,
   indicating that infertility plays an important role in the occurrence of
   EGPs. Compiling published data revealed that the 19\% EGP rate observed
   among Guassa geladas was also the median for polygynous nonhuman
   primates (range 0-57\%, N = 5 populations), in contrast to geladas in
   the Simien Mountains, where EGPs are absent or rare. Thus, intraspecific
   variation in EGP rates in geladas encompasses much of the range
   described across polygynous primates more broadly. The Guassa gelada EGP
   rate was similar to the median rate reported for mammals. Primates
   generally had a lower median rate of EGPs, more similar to the median
   rate reported for birds. Understanding variation in EGP rates requires
   understanding the outcomes of competing interests of males and females
   within the same species, as well as how these features contribute to the
   evolution of social systems and influence variation in EGP rates at
   higher taxonomic levels. (C) 2021 The Association for the Study of

Title = {The problem of adult play fighting: A comparative analysis of play and
   courtship in primates},
Journal = {ETHOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {105},
Number = {9},
Pages = {783-806},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Although play fighting, like play generally, is predominantly a feature
   of the juvenile phase, such behavior persists in the adults of many
   species. There are two major contexts in which adults engage in play
   fighting - with juveniles and with other adults. The least attention has
   been given to adult-adult play. However, one pattern that has been noted
   by several authors is that the most commonly occurring context of
   adult-adult play fighting is during courtship, and that this is more
   likely to occur in solitary species. Supposedly, such play could
   function to overcome the aggressiveness of potential pairmates
   unfamiliar with one another, or as a means of evaluating mate quality by
   one or both partners. By contrasting the presence and degree of play
   fighting during courtship with the degree of male-female familiarity,
   the hypothesis that the former is influenced by the latter is tested.
   Data on 35 species of primates, from 15 families, were compiled from the
   literature and compared using a method of independent contrasts that
   incorporates information on phylogenetic relationships. A significant
   regression was found, with the degree of male-female familiarity
   accounting for 40\% of the variance in courtship play. Therefore, our
   data support the hypothesis that play fighting in courtship is
   influenced by male-female patterns of association. However, the data
   also indicate that other factors must influence the occurrence of play
   fighting amongst adults, not only during courtship, but also in

Abstract = {Monomorphic lemurs of Madagascar allow us to investigate whether there
   are behavioural mechanisms that compensate for sex-specific differences
   in the costs of maintenance and reproduction in arboreal primates. Food
   selection of the pair-living Lepilemur ruficaudatus was studied in
   relation to food chemistry, and travel distances were measured as
   possible indications of differential investment in ranging activities
   (possibly related to the defence of territories and/or mating
   opportunities). Fourteen females and 14 males were radio-tracked for a
   total of 365 half-nights (from dusk to midnight or from midnight to
   dawn) at different times of the year (birth, lactation and weaning,
   pre-mating, post-mating). When based on monthly means, the two sexes did
   not differ in nightly travel distances. Food selection of females and
   males did not differ in relation to the chemical composition of leaves,
   but fruits consumed by females had lower fibre contents than fruits
   consumed by males. Even though other behavioural data are fragmentary,
   little evidence exists for behavioural mechanisms in L. ruficaudatus to
   compensate for the different energetic costs of females and males.},

Title = {Better Few than Hungry: Flexible Feeding Ecology of Collared Lemurs
   Eulemur collaris in Littoral Forest Fragments},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {Background: Frugivorous primates are known to encounter many problems to
   cope with habitat degradation, due to the fluctuating spatial and
   temporal distribution of their food resources. Since lemur communities
   evolved strategies to deal with periods of food scarcity, these primates
   are expected to be naturally adapted to fluctuating ecological
   conditions and to tolerate a certain degree of habitat changes. However,
   behavioral and ecological strategies adopted by frugivorous lemurs to
   survive in secondary habitats have been little investigated. Here, we
   compared the behavioral ecology of collared lemurs (Eulemur collaris) in
   a degraded fragment of littoral forest of south-east Madagascar,
   Mandena, with that of their conspecifics in a more intact habitat,
   Sainte Luce.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Lemur groups in Mandena and in Sainte
   Luce were censused in 2004/2007 and in 2000, respectively. Data were
   collected via instantaneous sampling on five lemur groups totaling 1,698
   observation hours. The Shannon index was used to determine dietary
   diversity and nutritional analyses were conducted to assess food
   quality. All feeding trees were identified and measured, and ranging
   areas determined via the minimum convex polygon. In the degraded area
   lemurs were able to modify several aspects of their feeding strategies
   by decreasing group size and by increasing feeding time, ranging areas,
   and number of feeding trees. The above strategies were apparently able
   to counteract a clear reduction in both food quality and size of feeding
   trees.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our findings indicate that collared lemurs in
   littoral forest fragments modified their behavior to cope with the
   pressures of fluctuating resource availability. The observed flexibility
   is likely to be an adaptation to Malagasy rainforests, which are known
   to undergo periods of fruit scarcity and low productivity. These results
   should be carefully considered when relocating lemurs or when selecting
   suitable areas for their conservation.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {I calculated rates of predation by 2 species of diurnal raptors,
   Polyboroides radiatus and Accipiter henstii, on the lemur community of
   Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar from 2700 h of observation and 470
   prey deliveries at 7 nests of each hawk species. The 2 hawks consumed 7
   of 12 lemurs found in the park region, with a body mass of 63-3500 g and
   including diurnal and nocturnal species of all group sizes. Calculations
   of predation rates indicate that raptor predation is a significant cause
   of mortality for lemur populations relative to other causes. Minimum
   rates of predation by Polyboroides radiatus and Accipiter henstii on
   Microcebus rufus, Cheirogaleus major, Avahi laniger, Hapalemur griseus,
   Eulemur fulvus rufus, Eulemur rubriventer, and Varecia variegata
   resulted in the raptors removing of 1-21\% of the population per yr,
   similar to other rates of predation on primates documented in the
   literature. Modeling of lemur populations under varying levels of raptor
   predation pressure that I calculated found that one may attribute 3-17\%
   of adult, juvenile, and infant mortality for nocturnal lemurs and 2-66\%
   of adult, juvenile, and infant mortality for diurnal lemurs to diurnal
   raptor predation. Raptor predation may significantly depress intrinsic
   growth rates and carrying capacity of Avahi laniger, Hapalemur griseus,
   Eulemur fulvus rufus, Eulemur rubriventer, and Varecia variegata owing
   to their low fecundities, long life spans, and long age to sexual
   maturation. Nocturnal lemurs may best avoid predation by diurnal raptors
   by exhibiting a solitary lifestyle and cryptic antipredator tactics,
   whereas, diurnal lemurs benefit less by increasing group size than by
   using specific antipredator tactics.},

Title = {Assessment of Organochlorine Pesticides and Metals in Ring-Tailed Lemurs

Abstract = {Like most of Madagascar's endemic primates, ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur
   catta) face a number of threats to their survival. Although habitat loss
   is of greatest concern, other anthropogenic factors including
   environmental contamination may also affect lemur health and survival.
   In this study, we examined ring-tailed lemurs from the Beza Mahafaly
   Special Reserve (BMSR), southern Madagascar for exposure to
   organochlorine (OC) pesticides and metals and examined differences in
   contaminant concentrations between sexes and among age groups, troops,
   and habitats. A total of 14 pesticides and 13 metals was detected in
   lemur blood (24 individuals) and hair (65 individuals) samples,
   respectively. p,p'-DDT, heptachlor, aldrin, heptachlor epoxide, endrin
   aldehyde, and endrin were among the most prevalent pesticides detected.
   Surprisingly, the persistent metabolite of p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, was not
   detected. The most commonly detected metals were aluminum, zinc, boron,
   phosphorus, silicon, and copper, whereas metals considered more
   hazardous to wildlife (e.g. arsenic, cadmium, lead, selenium, vanadium)
   were not found above detection limits. Overall, concentrations of OC
   pesticides and metals were low and similar to those considered to be
   background concentrations in other studies examining the ecotoxicology
   of wild mammals. Few inter-sex, -age, -troop, and -habitat differences
   in contaminant concentrations were observed, suggesting a uniform
   distribution of contaminants within the reserve. Several statistically
   significant relationships between lemur body size and contaminant
   concentrations were observed, but owing to the lack of supportive data
   regarding contaminant exposure in wild primates, the biological
   significance of these findings remains uncertain. Results of this study
   document exposure of ring-tailed lemurs at BMSR to multiple OC
   pesticides and metals and provide essential baseline data for future
   health and toxicological evaluations of lemurs and other wild primates,
   especially those in regions with expanding agricultural and mining
   operations. Am. J. Primatol. 71:998-1010, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss,

Title = {Sex differences in audience effects on anogenital scent marking in the
   red-fronted lemur},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {How the presence of conspecifics affects scent mark deposition remains
   an understudied aspect of olfactory communication, even though scent
   marking occurs in different social contexts. Sex differences in
   scent-marking behaviour are common, and sex-specific effects of the
   audience could therefore be expected. We investigated sex differences in
   intra-group audience effects on anogenital scent marking in four groups
   of wild red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) by performing focal
   scent-marking observations. We observed a total of 327 events divided
   into 223 anogenital scent-marking events and 104 pass-by events (i.e.
   passage without scent marking). Using a combination of generalised
   linear mixed models and exponential random graph models, we found that
   scent marking in red-fronted lemurs is associated with some behavioural
   flexibility linked to the composition of the audience at the time of
   scent deposition. In particular, our study revealed sex differences in
   the audience effects, with males being overall more sensitive to their
   audience than females. Moreover, we show that these audience effects
   were dependent on the relative degree of social integration of the focal
   individual compared to that of individuals in the audience (difference
   in Composite Sociality Index) as well as the strength of the dyadic
   affiliative relationship (rank of Dyadic Composite Sociality Index
   within the group). The audience effects also varied as a function of the
   audience radius considered. Hence, we showed that scent marking in
   red-fronted lemurs is associated with some behavioural flexibility
   linked to the composition of the audience, ascribing red-fronted lemurs'
   social competence in this context.},

Abstract = {Reproductive success in male primates can be influenced by testosterone
   ( T) and cortisol ( C). We examined them in wild Saguinus mystax via
   fecal hormone analysis. Firstly, we wanted to characterize male hormonal
   status over the course of the year. Further we tested the influence of
   the reproductive status of the breeding female, social instability, and
   intergroup encounter rates on T levels, comparing the results with
   predictions of the challenge hypothesis (Wingfield et al., 1990). We
   also tested for interindividual differences in hormonal levels, possibly
   related to social or breeding status. We collected data during a 12-mo
   study on 2 groups of moustached tamarins at the Estacion Biologica
   Quebrada Blanco in northeastern Peru. We found fairly similar T and C
   levels over the course of the year for all males. Yet an elevation of T
   shortly after the birth of infants, during the phase of ovarian
   inactivity of the group's breeding female, was evident. Hormonal levels
   were not significantly elevated during a phase of social instability,
   did not correlate with intergroup encounter rates, and did not differ
   between breeding and nonbreeding males. Our results confirm the
   challenge hypothesis ( Wingfield et al., 1990). The data suggest that
   reproductive competition in moustached tamarins is not based on
   endocrinological, but instead on behavioral mechanisms, possibly
   combined with sperm competition.},

Abstract = {From January 2000 through December 2002, focal plant censuses were
   carried out to assess monthly leaf, flower, and ripe fruit presence for
   423 individual plants (96 plant species, 39 families) within the
   littoral forest of Sainte Luce, Madagascar. Fruit-on-trail counts were
   conducted additionally in 2000 to allow comparison between both
   phenological methods. Despite low climatic seasonality and the absence
   of a dry season in the littoral forest, interannual phenological
   patterns were seasonal. Within year variability was present with clear
   periods of abundance and scarcity. All phenophases were highly
   intercorrelated and peaked from November through February. This was
   found in other humid Malagasy forests as well, while in dry Malagasy
   forests phenophases were separated in time perhaps due to the more
   seasonal climate. Temperature and day length seemed to influence all
   phenophases, the latter showing the strongest effect, while rainfall was
   only weekly associated with flushing and flowering. Differences in the
   presence of ripe fruits when comparing between sampling methods can be
   explained by the differential contribution of several life forms.},

Abstract = {Many primate species currently subsist in fragmented and
   anthropogenically disturbed habitats. Different threats arise depending
   on the species' life history strategy, dietary requirements and habitat
   preference. Additionally, anthropogenic disturbance is far from uniform
   and may affect individual forest fragments in a single landscape in
   differing ways. We studied the effects of fragmentation on three species
   of diurnal primate, Cebus albifrons, Alouatta seniculus and Ateles
   hybridus, in Magdalena Valley, Colombia. We tested the assumption that
   generalist species are more resilient than specialist species to habitat
   degradation by examining the fragments' vegetation and spatial structure
   and how these affected primate presence and abundance patterns. We found
   C. albifrons, a generalist, to be the most abundant species in 9 of 10
   forest fragments, regardless of the level of habitat disturbance. A.
   hybridus, a large-bodied primate with a specialist diet, was either
   absent or low in abundance in fragments that had experienced recent
   disturbances and was found only in higher-quality fragments, regardless
   of the fragment size. A. seniculus, a species considered to have a
   highly flexible diet and the ability to survive in degraded habitat, was
   found in intermediate abundances between those of Cebus spp. and Ateles
   spp., and was more frequently found in high-quality fragments. (C) 2016

Abstract = {The size of the infraorbital foramen (IOF) has been used in drawing both
   phylogenetic and ecological inferences regarding fossil taxa. Within the
   order Primates, frugivores have relatively larger IOFs than folivores or
   insectivores. This study uses relative IOF size in lemurs to test prior
   trophic inferences for subfossil lemurs and to explore the pattern of
   variation within and across lemur families. The IOFs of individuals
   belonging to 12 extinct lemur species were measured and compared to
   those of extant Malagasy strepsirhines. Observations matched
   expectations drawn from more traditional approaches (e. g. dental
   morphology and microwear, stable isotope analysis) remarkably well. We
   confirm that extinct lemurs belonging to the families Megaladapidae and
   Palaeopropithecidae were predominantly folivorous and that species
   belonging to the genus Pachylemur (Lemuridae) were frugivores. Very high
   values for relative IOF area in Archaeolemur support frugivory but are
   also consistent with omnivory, as certain omnivores use facial touch
   cues while feeding. These results provide additional evidence that the
   IOF can be used as an informative osteological feature in both
   phylogenetic and paleoecological interpretations of the fossil record.

Title = {Does habitat disturbance affect stress, body condition and parasitism in
   two sympatric lemurs?},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Understanding how animals react to human-induced changes in their
   environment is a key question in conservation biology. Owing to their
   potential correlation with fitness, several physiological parameters are
   commonly used to assess the effect of habitat disturbance on animals'
   general health status. Here, we studied how two lemur species, the
   fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius) and the grey mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus), respond to changing environmental conditions by
   comparing their stress levels (measured as hair cortisol concentration),
   parasitism and general body condition across four habitats ordered along
   a gradient of human disturbance at Kirindy Forest, Western Madagascar.
   These two species previously revealed contrasting responses to human
   disturbance; whereas M. murinus is known as a resilient species, C.
   medius is rarely encountered in highly disturbed habitats. However,
   neither hair cortisol concentrations nor parasitism patterns
   (prevalence, parasite species richness and rate of multiple infections)
   and body condition varied across the gradient of anthropogenic
   disturbance. Our results indicate that the effect of anthropogenic
   activities at Kirindy Forest is not reflected in the general health
   status of both species, which may have developed a range of behavioural
   adaptations to deal with suboptimal conditions. Nonetheless, a
   difference in relative density among sites suggests that the carrying
   capacity of disturbed habitat is lower, and both species respond
   differently to environmental changes, with C. medius being more
   negatively affected. Thus, even for behaviourally flexible species,
   extended habitat deterioration could hamper long-term viability of
   populations.},

Abstract = {Parallel dispersal occurs when individuals emigrate together with peers
   or close kin, or immigrate into groups containing familiar or closely
   related individuals. To understand the evolution of parallel dispersal
   in male primates, we explore if parallel dispersal co-occurs with male
   coalitions, or with other traits that may facilitate coalition
   formation. We conducted a meta-analysis using phylogenetic comparative
   methods to test for an association between male parallel dispersal and
   male coalition formation, multi-male social groups, male-biased
   dispersal, high paternity concentration, and breeding seasonality. These
   traits were predicted to be correlated with parallel dispersal because
   they increase the availability of potential dispersal partners, increase
   individual competitive ability, or provide inclusive fitness benefits
   for cooperating relatives. Pairwise comparisons revealed that coalitions
   in general were significantly associated with male parallel dispersal.
   However, neither intergroup nor intragroup coalitions were associated
   with parallel dispersal when examined separately, though there was a
   trend towards significance for intergroup coalitions. Male-biased
   dispersal was equivocally associated with parallel dispersal, while
   multi-male social groups, paternity concentration, and breeding
   seasonality were not. These results suggest that the evolution of male
   parallel dispersal may be linked with the propensity of males to form
   coalitions and the need to retain coalition partners.},

Abstract = {Traditional socio-ecological models consider that folivorous primates
   experience limited feeding competition due to the low quality, high
   abundance, and even distribution of leaves. Evidence from several
   folivorous species that experience similar constraints to frugivores
   does not support this hypothesis. The sympatric lemur genera Avahi
   (Indriidae) and Lepilemur (Lepilemuridae) are good models to understand
   how food availability constrains folivores since they are both
   nocturnal, folivorous, and have a comparable body mass. Here we
   investigate how two nocturnal folivorous primates, Avahi meridionalis
   and Lepilemur fleuretae, living in the lowland rain forest of
   Tsitongambarika, South-East Madagascar, partition their dietary niche
   and are influenced by seasonality of young leaves. To account for food
   availability, we collected annual phenological data on 769 trees from
   200 species. We also collected behavioural data on 5 individuals per
   lemur species from August 2015 to July 2016 via continuous focal
   sampling. We found the phenological profile to be seasonal with peaks of
   leaf flushing, flowering, and fruiting occurring in the austral summer.
   The two species showed limited dietary overlap (37\% rich period, 6\%
   lean period), and A. meridionalis showed higher feeding time and longer
   daily distances travelled during the rich period. Lepilemur fleuretae
   showed a dietary shift during the lean period, relying more on mature
   leaves (73.3\% during the lean period, 13.5\% during the rich period)
   but maintaining similar activity levels between seasons. The time spent
   feeding on food items by A. meridionalis was positively correlated with
   the nitrogen content and negatively correlated with polyphenols during
   the rich period. We highlighted a clear effect of the seasonality of
   young leaves on the diet, nutritional content, activity patterns, and
   daily distances travelled by two folivorous species, which can be linked
   to nutrient balancing and time-minimising versus energy-maximising
   strategies.},

Abstract = {In group-living species with male dominance hierarchies where receptive
   periods of females do not overlap, high male reproductive skew would be
   predicted. However, the existence of female multiple mating and
   alternative male mating strategies can call into question single-male
   monopolization of paternity in groups. Ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)
   are seasonally breeding primates that live in multi-male, multi-female
   groups. Although established groups show male dominance hierarchies,
   male dominance relationships can break down during mating periods. In
   addition, females are the dominant sex and mate with multiple males
   during estrus, including group residents, and extra-group malesposing
   the question of whether there is high or low male paternity skew in
   groups. In this study, we analyzed paternity in a population of wild L.
   catta from the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve in southwestern Madagascar.
   Paternity was determined with 80-95\% confidence for 39 offspring born
   to nine different groups. We calculated male reproductive skew indices
   for six groups, and our results showed a range of values corresponding
   to both high and low reproductive skew. Between 21\% and 33\% of
   offspring (3 of 14 or three of nine, counting paternity assignments at
   the 80\% or 95\% confidence levels, respectively) were sired by
   extra-troop males. Males siring offspring within the same group during
   the same year appear to be unrelated. Our study provides evidence of
   varying male reproductive skew in different L. catta groups. A single
   male may monopolize paternity across one or more years, while in other
   groups, >1 male can sire offspring within the same group, even within a
   single year. Extra-group mating is a viable strategy that can result in
   extra-group paternity for L. catta males.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Plants producing toxic plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) deter
   folivores from feeding on them. Animals that can cope with noxious PSMs
   have a niche with a competitive advantage over other species. However,
   the ability to cope with toxic PSMs incurs the costs of detoxification.
   To assess possible compensations for the ingestion of toxic PSMs, we
   compare the chemical quality of plants consumed by bamboo lemurs (genera
   Hapalemur and Prolemur; strepsirrhine primates of Madagascar) in areas
   with and without bamboo. Some bamboo lemurs consume bamboo containing
   concentrations of cyanogenic substances 10-50 times above the average
   lethal dosage for mammals, and we postulate that animals consuming
   cyanogenic substances need supplementary protein or readily available
   energy for detoxification. We compared the chemical composition of food
   consumed by three species of bamboo lemurs that feed mainly (>80\% of
   their time) on bamboo in the evergreen rainforest of Ranomafana
   (Madagascar) with published data of the diets of bamboo lemurs at two
   sites without highly cyanogenic plants (reed beds of Lac Alaotra and the
   evergreen littoral forest of Mandena) and with food of sympatric
   folivorous lemur species that do not feed on bamboo. Lemurs feeding on
   bamboo consumed up to twice as much protein as bamboo lemurs in areas
   without bamboo and sympatric lemur species that feed on leaves of trees.
   Concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates (a source of energy)
   showed the opposite trend. This result supports the hypothesis that
   feeding on cyanogenic plants is linked to high protein intake, either as
   a source of protein or for sulfur-containing amino acids that can be
   used for detoxification. Owing to the high protein concentrations in
   bamboo, however, we cannot distinguish between the hypothesis that
   lemurs that eat bamboo target additional food items with higher protein
   from the hypothesis that lemurs feeding on bamboo unavoidably obtain
   higher concentrations of protein than animals feeding on leaves of
   trees, without an added nutritional benefit.},

Abstract = {Squeals are sharp and forceful short-range vocalizations used as
   aggressive and submissive agonistic signals by many mammalian species.
   The ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), a female-dominant strepsirhine
   primate, has a male-specific squeal call with proposed male-male
   agonistic functions and male-female courtship functions that have never
   been empirically tested. The goal of my study is to clarify why
   ring-tailed lemur males squeal at other males and females by applying
   the handicap hypothesis to this male-specific vocalization. This
   hypothesis has rarely been tested in primates, and this study elucidates
   how the rate of a male-specific call relates to male-male and
   male-female behavior in a Malagasy strepsirhine. To test whether males
   squeal towards other males to assert dominance, I predict that male
   squealing rate is positively correlated with dominance rank. I further
   predict that male ring-tailed lemurs squeal at other males while engaged
   in agonistic interactions, and that squealing during an interaction is
   positively correlated with winning that encounter. To test whether males
   squeal towards females as a mate attraction signal, I predict that male
   squealing rate is higher on estrus days, and that estrous females
   indicate attraction by approaching squealing males. From March to July
   2010, 480hr of focal data were collected on 25 males aged three and
   older at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar. I continuously
   observed each male for 30min at a time and recorded all agonistic
   interactions and squeal vocalizations using 1-0 sampling at 2.5-min
   intervals. Squealing rate was higher during times of male-male agonism
   when compared to times without male-male agonism, and males with higher
   dominance ranks had higher squealing rates. In contrast, the mate
   attraction hypothesis was not supported. My results suggest that the
   male squeal is an agonistic signal when used in male-male interaction in
   ring-tailed lemurs, but does not specifically indicate aggression or
   submission. Am. J. Primatol. 75:1174-1184, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley

   vomeronasal organ, investigate scents via olfactory and gustatory means,
   and are exquisitely sensitive to chemically encoded messages. Variation
   in delivery, scent mixing and multimodality alters signal detection,
   longevity and intended audience. Based on an integrative, 19-species
   review, the main scent source used (excretory versus glandular)
   differentiates nocturnal from diurnal or cathemeral species, reflecting
   differing socioecological demands and evolutionary trajectories.
   Condition-dependent signals reflect immutable (species, sex, identity,
   genetic diversity, immunity and kinship) and transient (health, social
   status, reproductive state and breeding history) traits, consistent with
   socio-reproductive functions. Sex reversals in glandular elaboration,
   marking rates or chemical richness in female-dominant species implicate
   sexual selection of olfactory ornaments in both sexes. Whereas some
   compounds may be endogenously produced and modified (e.g. via hormones),
   microbial analyses of different odorants support the fermentation
   hypothesis of bacterial contribution. The intimate contexts of
   information transfer and varied functions provide important parallels
   applicable to olfactory communication in humans. This article is part of
   the Theo Murphy meeting issue `Olfactory communication in humans'.},

Title = {Predator avoidance and dietary fibre predict diurnality in the

Abstract = {Though numerous mammalian taxa exhibit cathemerality (i.e. activity
   distributed across the 24-h cycle), this includes very few primates,
   exceptions being species from Aotinae and Lemuridae. Four non-mutually
   exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the ultimate
   determinants for cathemeral activity in lemurs: thermoregulatory
   benefits, anti-predator strategy, competition avoidance and metabolic
   dietary-related needs. However, these have only been explored in the
   frugivorous genus Eulemur, with some species increasing nocturnality as
   a possible response to avoid diurnal raptors and to increase their
   ability to digest fibre during resource-scarce periods. Since Eulemur
   lack specializations for digesting bulk food, this strategy would allow
   for processing fibres over the full 24-h. The folivorous lemurids, i.e.
   genus Hapalemur, provide a divergent model to explore these hypotheses
   due to gastrointestinal adaptations for digesting dietary fibre and
   small body size compared to Eulemur. We linked continuous activity data
   collected from archival tags with observational behaviour and feeding
   data from three groups of adult Hapalemur meridionalis from January to
   December 2013. We tested the effects of thermoregulation, predator
   avoidance and the weighted proportion of digestible dietary fibre on the
   daily diurnal/nocturnal activity ratio using a Linear Mixed-Model. Our
   best-fit model revealed that increased canopy exposure and dietary fibre
   predicted greater diurnality. Our findings partly contrast with previous
   predictions for frugivorous lemurids. We propose a divergent adaptive
   explanation for folivorous lemurids. We suggest that the need to avoid
   terrestrial predators, as well as longer digestive bouts during bulk
   food periods, may override cathemerality in favour of diurnality in
   these bamboo lemurs.
   Significance statement
   Southern bamboo lemurs are active throughout the 24-h day, with high
   proportions of dietary fibre increasing diurnality, in contrast to other
   cathemeral primates. They also increase diurnality on days when using
   areas with greater canopy exposure, potentially avoiding nocturnal
   predators in risky foraging areas. We suggest that folivorous lemurids
   may require long periods of inactivity to conserve energy and digest
   dietary fibre, thus limiting activity to periods of optimal foraging
   efficiency over the 24-h cycle.},

Title = {Patterns of species change in anthropogenically disturbed forests of

Abstract = {Five main conclusions arise from this review of the responses of species
   to anthropogenic disturbance in Madagascar: First, species' reactions to
   anthropogenic disturbance are generally negative, but remain poorly
   known. Our knowledge is patchy among and within higher taxonomic groups;
   we are still largely gathering case studies. Second, taxonomic groups
   vary considerably in which proximate factors are most important. Third,
   several groups show differing responses within different ecoregions.
   Whether these differences are consistent across groups requires further
   testing. Fourth, related species often have divergent reactions to
   disturbance, even within lower taxonomic groupings (families or genera).
   Thus, we cannot rely on phylogenetic relatedness or even ecological
   similarity to infer similarity in responses. Finally, disturbance
   typically reduces species diversity (especially of native and/or endemic
   species), but also causes species turnover, typically with forest
   specialists replaced by grassland generalists, and endemics replaced by
   non-endemics (including invasives). Given these knowledge gaps, we
   stress the urgency of applied studies that assess species' ecology,
   behaviour and health across disturbance gradients, including purely
   anthropogenic landscapes. Remaining natural vegetation and protected
   areas will be unable to preserve Madagascar's biodiversity under the
   impact of climatic change; we must understand responses of plants and
   animals to disturbance in order to create buffer zones and corridors
   combining secondary, degraded and natural habitats. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {There is a well-documented relationship between development and other
   life-history parameters among anthropoid primates. Smaller-bodied
   anthropoids tend to mature more rapidly than do larger-bodied species.
   Among anthropoids of similar body sizes, folivorous species tend to grow
   and mature more quickly than do frugivorous species, thus attaining
   adult body size at an earlier age. This pattern conforms to the
   expectations of Janson and van Schaik's ``ecological risk aversion
   hypothesis,{''} which predicts that rates of growth and maturation
   should vary in inverse relation to the intensity of intraspecific
   feeding competition. According to the ecological risk aversion
   hypothesis (RAH), species experiencing high intraspecific feeding
   competition will grow and mature slowly to reduce the risk of mortality
   due to food shortages. Species experiencing low levels of intraspecific
   feeding competition will shorten the juvenile period to reduce the
   overall duration of this high-risk portion of the life cycle. This paper
   focuses on development and maturation in lemurs. We show that folivorous
   lemurs (such as indriids) grow and mature more slowly than like-sized
   frugivorous lemurs (e.g., most lemurids), but tend to exhibit faster
   dental development. Their dental developmental schedules are accelerated
   on an absolute scale, relative to craniofacial growth, and relative to
   particular life-history landmarks, such as weaning. Dental development
   has a strong phylogenetic component: even those lemurids that consume
   substantial amounts of foliage have slower dental development than those
   indriids that consume substantial amounts of fruit. Implications of
   these results for the RAH are discussed, and an explanation for this
   hypothesis' failure to predict lemur growth schedules is offered. We
   propose that the differing developmental schedules of folivorous and
   frugivorous lemurs may reflect different solutions to the ecological
   problem of environmental instability: some rely on a strategy of low
   maternal input and slow returns, while others rely on a strategy of high
   maternal input and fast returns. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Do functional traits offset the effects of fragmentation? The case of
   large-bodied diurnal lemur species},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Number = {4, SI},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Primates worldwide are faced with increasing threats making them more
   vulnerable to extinction. Anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat
   degradation and fragmentation, are among the main concerns, and in
   Madagascar, these issues have become widespread. As this situation
   continues to worsen, we sought to understand how fragmentation affects
   primate distribution throughout the island. Further, because species may
   exhibit different sensitivity to fragmentation, we also aimed to
   estimate the role of functional traits in mitigating their response. We
   collated data from 32 large-bodied lemur species ranges, consisting of
   species from the families Lemuridae (five genera) and Indriidae (two
   genera). We fitted Generalized Linear Models to determine the role of
   habitat fragmentation characteristics, for example, forest cover, patch
   size, edge density, and landscape configuration, as well as the
   protected area (PA) network, on the species relative probability of
   presence. We then assessed how the influence of functional traits
   (dietary guild, home range size) mitigate the response of species to
   these habitat metrics. Habitat area had a strong positive effect for
   many species, and there were significantly negative effects of
   fragmentation on the distribution of many lemur species. In addition,
   there was a positive influence of PAs on many lemur species'
   distribution. Functional trait classifications showed that lemurs of all
   dietary guilds are negatively affected by fragmentation; however,
   folivore-frugivores show greater flexibility/variability in terms of
   habitat area and landscape complexity compared to nearly exclusive
   folivores and frugivores. Furthermore, species of all home range sizes
   showed a negative response to fragmentation, while habitat area had an
   increasingly positive effect as home range increased in size. Overall,
   the general trends for the majority of lemur species are dire and point
   to the need for immediate actions on a multitude of fronts, most
   importantly landscape-level reforestation efforts.},

Title = {Profiling caregivers: Hormonal variation underlying allomaternal care in

Abstract = {Neuroendocrine evidence suggests that paternal care is mediated by
   hormonal mechanisms, where hormonal changes in expectant and new fathers
   facilitate infant care. In species with obligate and extensive paternal
   care such as humans, androgen levels decline once males are paired and
   have offspring, and in direct response to offspring care. Facultative
   infant care is widespread in the Order Primates, but the underlying
   hormonal mechanisms are largely unknown. We found that wild, red-bellied
   lemurs living in family groups (two adults and their presumed offspring)
   varied in the amount of care they provided infants. The more fathers
   invested in helping infants (measured as a composite of carrying,
   holding, huddling, grooming, and playing), and specifically the more
   they huddled and groomed with infants, the higher their fecal androgen
   (fA) levels, contrary to expectations. Carrying was negatively related
   to fA levels. Helping by subadults and juveniles was not related to
   their own fA levels. Elevated fA levels during infant dependence have
   been observed in other vertebrate species, and are thought to reflect
   reinvestment in mating rather than investment in dependent offspring.
   However, red-bellied lemurs do not mate until after infants are weaned,
   and they have long-term pair-bonds, suggesting that elevated fA levels
   play a role in offspring care. These results support a growing body of
   research suggesting that elevated androgen levels do not inhibit
   protective infant care.},

Title = {Evaluating ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) from southwestern Madagascar

Abstract = {In light of historical and recent anthropogenic influences on Malagasy
   primate populations, in this study ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta)
   samples from two sites in southwestern Madagascar, Beza Mahafaly Special
   Reserve (BMSR) and Tsimanampetsotsa National Park (TNP), were evaluated
   for the genetic signature of a population bottleneck. A total of 45
   individuals (20 from BMSR and 25 from TNP) were genotyped at seven
   microsatellite loci. Three methods were used to evaluate these
   populations for evidence of a historical bottleneck: M-ratio,
   mode-shift, and heterozygosity excess tests. Three mutation models were
   used for heterozygosity excess tests: the stepwise mutation model (SMM),
   two-phase model (TPM), and infinite allele model (IAM). M-ratio
   estimations indicated a potential bottleneck in both populations under
   some conditions. Although mode-shift tests did not strongly indicate a
   population bottleneck in the recent historical past when samples from
   all individuals were included, a female-only analysis indicated a
   potential bottleneck in TNP. Heterozygosity excess was indicated under
   two of the three mutation models (IAM and TPM), with TNP showing
   stronger evidence of heterozygosity excess than BMSR. Taken together,
   these results suggest that a bottleneck may have occurred among L. catta
   in southwestern Madagascar in the recent past. Given knowledge of how
   current major stochastic climatic events and human-induced change can
   negatively impact extant lemur populations, it is reasonable that
   comparable events in the historical past could have caused a population
   bottleneck. This evaluation additionally functions to highlight the
   continuing environmental and anthropogenic challenges faced by lemurs in
   southwestern Madagascar. Am J Phys Anthropol 147: 21-29, 2012. (C) 2011

Abstract = {A basic understanding of the taxonomy, diversity, and distributions of
   primates is essential for their conservation. This review of the status
   of the taxonomy of lemurs is based on a 5-d workshop entitled ``Primate
   Taxonomy for the New Millennium,{''} held at the Disney Institute,
   Orlando, Florida, in February 2000. The aim is not to present a
   taxonomic revision, but to review our current understanding of the
   diversity and current and past ranges of lemurs and indicate where there
   is controversy, discrepancy, or lack of knowledge. Our goal therefore is
   to provide a baseline for future taxonomic investigation, as well as a
   clearer focus for research and conservation priorities. We here focus on
   the lemurs of Madagascar and recognize 5 families, 15 genera, and 99
   species and subspecies. We list 39 species of lemurs described since
   2000: 2 dwarf lemurs, Cheirogaleus; 11 mouse lemurs, Microcebus; a giant
   mouse lemur, Mirza; a bamboo lemur, Hapalemur; 17 sportive lemurs,
   Lepilemur; and 7 woolly lemurs, Avahi. Taxonomic revisions have resulted
   in the resurrection of a further 9 taxa. However, the figures do not
   represent the total diversity of Malagasy lemurs because more new
   species are being identified via new field studies and accompanying
   genetic research, and should be described in the near future.},

Title = {Testosterone in juvenile and adolescent male chimpanzees (Pan

Year = {2006},
Volume = {130},

Abstract = {Testosterone is a steroid hormone with diverse effects on male
   reproductive function and behavior. The relationship between
   testosterone and social behavior such as mating and aggression has been
   investigated in a variety of primate species, but few such studies have
   been conducted on chimpanzees, and even fewer on primates during the
   juvenile and adolescent periods. This study explores the relationship
   between baseline urinary testosterone and behavioral variables including
   dominance rank, rates of aggression toward peers, and behavioral style
   in 16 juvenile and adolescent male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) living
   at the New Iberia Research Center in Louisiana. Behavioral observations
   and urine collection occurred during four research periods, each a year
   apart. After correcting for the positive association between
   testosterone and age, testosterone was positively associated with both
   dominance rank and rates of aggression directed at others. It was
   negatively associated with rates of aggression received. Individuals
   scoring highest in the ``mellow{''} behavioral style component showed
   higher levels of testosterone than individuals scoring lowest in this
   component, an effect that may be partially due to the confounding effect
   of rank. The results of this study suggest that hormonal changes during
   the period preceding adulthood are not simply programmed physiological
   processes tied primarily to age-related change, but that important
   age-independent relationships with behavior also exist.},

Volume = {139},

Abstract = {Urine marking has been neglected in prosimian primates. Captive studies
   showed that the Malagasy prosimian Lemur catta scent marks with urine,
   as well as via specialized depositions. L. catta urine mark, a
   multimodal signal, differs from simple urination in terms of different
   design features, including tail configuration: the tail is held up
   during marking (UT-up) and down during urination (UT-down). We explore
   economy and function of UT-up in the female dominant L. catta. We
   collected 240 h of observations on one group at Berenty (south
   Madagascar) during the nonmating period via all occurrences sampling. We
   gathered behavioral bouts/contexts (marking, traveling, feeding,
   resting, and fights) and recorded 191 UT-ups and 79 UT-downs. Via Global
   Positioning System we established the location of the places frequented
   i) by extragroup individuals and ii) by group members, in this case
   recording also behavioral context and time spent in each place. We found
   that L. catta UT-up is not an artifact of captivity. Moreover, UT-up in
   the nonmating period plays a role in territorial defense, which is
   mostly performed by females in L. catta society. Female UT-ups were the
   most investigated and UT-ups were performed/investigated more by
   females. Finally, signal use is parsimonious, in that urine is
   economically placed where and when detection probability by competitors
   is higher. UT-ups were performed in places most frequented by extragroup
   individuals and in presence of extragroup competitors (nonrandom
   topography and timing). In conclusion, we suggest that UT-up is an
   economical signal with a primarily territorial function. Am J Phys

Abstract = {Infant killing by primates is highly controversial. Sexual selection of
   infanticidal males has been disputed especially for seasonally breeding
   species, in which death of an infant does not advance conception of the

   University Primate Center, and review cases seen elsewhere. Observed
   attacks leading to wounds or death conservatively total twelve by
   extratroop males, two by troop males, and seven by troop females.
   Eulemur ave occasional vertebrate predators, whose prey includes infant
   Lemur catta. Wounds inflicted by lemurs are usually abdominal canine
   slashes or bites to the head with rare eating, a pattern distinct front
   carnivore and raptor kills. Infant killing as inferred front corpses is
   more frequent than previously thought, but still rare. Adaptive
   advantages of killing plausibly include eliminating resource competitors
   of females, and sexual selection on males.},

Abstract = {This study investigated hormonal and demographic processes underlying
   unimale and multimale mating systems in primates. Reproductive skew and
   challenge models of male competition provide conflicting predictions of
   the relationship of male residence to group composition and androgen
   regulation. These predictions were tested using endocrine and
   socioecological data from Kenyan vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus
   aethiops). Serum samples from 57 adult male monkeys, drawn from 19
   separate groups and 4 populations, were assayed for testosterone by
   radioimmunoassay. Male ability to respond to conspecific challenge was
   assessed by their testosterone response to the capture protocol.
   Analyses showed that reproductive skew models were useful predictors of
   intergroup and interpopulation variation in male residence and T
   profiles. The Limited Control model of male residence was supported by
   positive correlations of the number of males per group with the number
   of females without dependent offspring, demonstrating that
   monopolization potential was a key determinant of male residence.
   Testosterone concentrations under conditions that elevated serum levels
   were positively correlated with infanticide risk, supporting the
   Concession model. Population comparisons provided evidence for increased
   T responsiveness where groups were predominantly unimale. Unimale
   populations were from sites with higher rainfall, suggesting that
   ecological factors contributed to population differences in male
   residence and T regulation.},

Title = {The social systems of gregarious lemurs: Lack of convergence with
   anthropoids due to evolutionary disequilibrium?},
Journal = {ETHOLOGY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {102},
Number = {11},
Pages = {915-941},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The gregarious lemurs of Madagascar show a lack of convergence with
   anthropoid primates in several social, demographic, morphological and
   ecological features. They lack sexual dimorphism in canine and body
   size, and live in groups with equal adult sex ratios that can vary in
   composition from pairs to larger units. In most species, females
   dominate males, and have brief and often synchronized estruses. Finally,
   lemurs are often active during both day and night (i.e. cathemeral).
   Three hypotheses for this lack of convergence are discussed. The
   traditional explanation is that Madagascar's unique ecological pressures
   have forced females to exclude males from access to limiting resources,
   selecting for the other unique features as means to maintain female
   dominance over males. This idea is not logically consistent and is also
   poorly supported empirically. The second hypothesis claims that
   cathemerality imposes unique constraints on lemur social organization.
   The social behavior of cathemeral taxa is largely consistent with this
   idea. However, the social organization of the diurnal species is not.
   The third hypothesis claims that recent ecological changes, in
   particular the demise of large diurnal raptors, have produced a mismatch
   between current activity periods and adaptations to activity period.
   This idea is supported by a review of morphological adaptations to light
   conditions among lemurs, and, more generally, by a comparative analysis
   of cathemerality among tropical forest mammals. We conclude that the
   social systems of non-nocturnal lemurs are best considered as groups
   formed by species adapted to live in pairs. However, we cannot
   conclusively exclude the possibility that cathemeral activity is an old
   and stable activity pattern among lemurs. We indicate which data would
   decide the issue, and discuss the implications for views of social
   evolution of lemurs and other animals.},

Title = {Life history costs and benefits of encephalization: a comparative test
   using data from long-term studies of primates in the wild},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {54},
Number = {5},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The correlation between brain size and life history has been
   investigated in many previous studies, and several viable explanations
   have been proposed. However, the results of these studies are often at
   odds, causing uncertainties about whether these two character complexes
   underwent correlated evolution. These disparities could arise from the
   mixture of wild and captive values in the datasets, potentially
   obscuring real relationships, and from differences in the methods of
   controlling for phylogenetic non independence of species values. This
   paper seeks to resolve these difficulties by (1) proposing an
   overarching hypothesis that encompasses many of the previously proposed
   hypotheses, and (2) testing the predictions of this hypothesis using
   rigorously compiled data and utilizing multiple methods of analysis. We
   hypothesize that the adaptive benefit of increased encephalization is an
   increase in reproductive lifespan or efficiency, which must be
   sufficient to outweigh the costs due to growing and maturing the larger
   brain. These costs and benefits are directly reflected in the length of
   life history stages. We tested this hypothesis on a wide range of
   primate species. Our results demonstrate that encephalization is
   significantly correlated with prolongation of all stages of
   developmental life history except the lactational period, and is
   significantly correlated with an extension of the reproductive lifespan.
   These results support the contention that the link between brain size
   and life history is caused by a balance between the costs of growing a
   brain and the survival benefits the brain provides. Thus, our results
   suggest that the evolution of prolonged life history during human
   evolution is caused by increased encephalization. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {5},
Pages = {900-913},

Abstract = {The characteristics of food ingested by a primate affect its
   assimilation of energy by modulating food passage rate. In general,
   digestive time increases in folivorous primates and decreases in
   frugivorous primates when they are fed higher fiber diets but this
   relationship is understudied in exudativorous primates. We compared the
   food passage rate of five slow loris species. We studied 34 wild-caught
   slow lorises (15 Nycticebus coucang, 15 N. javanicus, and 4 N.
   menegensis) in an Indonesian rescue center and four captive-born slow
   lorises (2 N. bengalensis and 2 N. pygmaeus) in a UK institution. We fed
   the Indonesian subjects two different diets: a captive-type diet
   comprising fruits, vegetables, and insects and a wild-type diet
   formulated to be similar in nutrients to that consumed by slow lorises
   in the wild, consisting of gum, insects, vegetables, and nectar. We fed
   the UK subjects a diet of gum, vegetables, insects, and hard-boiled
   eggs. We formulated this diet to mimic the wild diet, with notably
   higher fiber fractions and lower soluble sugars than the previous diet.
   We measured two variables: the transit time (TT) and the mean retention
   time (MRT). We mixed 1 tsp. of glitter in bananas or gum as our markers
   and fed them to the slow lorises immediately before their main diet. We
   noted the date and time of feeding and of appearances of the marker in
   feces. We weighed food given and left over for each individual to
   calculate ingested foods and nutrients. We found that TTs were not
   affected by diet treatment but MRTs were significantly longer for all
   species fed the wild-type diet. Our results show that Nycticebus spp.
   have long MRTs for their body weight, and N. pygmdaeus may have the
   slowest MRT of all primates in relation to body mass. The digestive
   flexibility of exudativorous primates should allow them to maximize
   fermentation opportunities when they ingest more (appropriate) fiber by
   increasing the amount of time the fiber substrate stays in the large
   intestine. Exudativorous primates appear to have plastic digestive
   strategies that may be an adaptation to cope with relatively
   nutrient-poor staple food sources such as gum. The provision of gum in a
   captive setting may therefore provide benefits for gut health in slow
   lorises.},

Title = {Eco-evo-devo of the lemur syndrome: did adaptive behavioral plasticity
   get canalized in a large primate radiation?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 24},
Abstract = {Background: Comprehensive explanations of behavioral adaptations rarely
   invoke all levels famously admonished by Niko Tinbergen. The role of
   developmental processes and plasticity, in particular, has often been
   neglected. In this paper, we combine ecological, physiological and
   developmental perspectives in developing a hypothesis to account for the
   evolution of `the lemur syndrome', a combination of reduced sexual
   dimorphism, even adult sex ratios, female dominance and mild genital
   masculinization characterizing group-living species in two families of
   Malagasy primates.
   Results: We review the different components of the lemur syndrome and
   compare it with similar adaptations reported for other mammals. We find
   support for the assertion that the lemur syndrome represents a unique
   set of integrated behavioral, demographic and morphological traits. We
   combine existing hypotheses about underlying adaptive function and
   proximate causation by adding a potential developmental mechanism
   linking maternal stress and filial masculinization, and outline an
   evolutionary scenario for its canalization.
   Conclusions: We propose a new hypothesis linking ecological,
   physiological, developmental and evolutionary processes to adumbrate a
   comprehensive explanation for the evolution of the lemur syndrome, whose
   assumptions and predictions can guide diverse future research on lemurs.
   This hypothesis should also encourage students of other behavioral
   phenomena to consider the potential role of developmental plasticity in
   evolutionary innovation.},

Abstract = {I investigated sex differences in feeding ecology in a wild group of
   Hapalemur griseus, gray bamboo lemur; in southeastern Madagascar: Males
   and females differed in daily dietary diversity, height use while
   feeding, and spatial position within the group. Based on all-occurrences
   of feeding bouts and 15-min point samples, the adult female had
   significantly higher daily dietary diversity indices than those of
   males. The female also fed at significantly lower heights than. the
   males did. There are also significant differences between age classes
   with the subadult male exhibiting the lowest dietary diversity and
   feeding at the greatest heights. During feeding, the female stayed in
   closest proximity to both juveniles, whereas adult males were
   peripheral. In contrast, the males moved closer in proximity to the
   female when resting and traveling. These sex differences could be
   explained 1) by the metabolic cost of reproduction for females, 2) as
   strategies to mitigate the cost of feeding competition between males and
   females, 3) by male role performance as a predator detector, and 4) by
   different social priorities of males and females.},

   selection theory. Using a conceptual model, we show the conditions for
   which passive mate guarding with copulatory plugs can be an alternative
   and more successful strategy to active (direct) guarding, reducing
   selection pressure on large male size. The model predicts that
   copulatory plugs in mammals should be favoured in species for which
   females have short sexual receptivity periods. Using data on 62 primate
   species and a phylogenetic regression approach, we show that, as
   predicted, copulatory plugs are negatively associated with degree of
   sexual dimorphism and females' sexual receptivity length. Penile spines
   are also significantly associated with plug use and short receptivity
   periods suggesting a possible offensive role in sperm competition.
   Results highlight that life-history characteristics, such as sexual
   receptivity lengths, may alter the costs and benefits of alternative
   male strategies and thus alter the strength of sexual selection.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-69},
Abstract = {This study examined whether fecal cortisol could be used as an index of
   stress responses. The stress responsiveness of fecal cortisol was tested
   with a stressor known to stimulate adrenal activity, the stress of
   anesthesia. Daily fecal and urine samples were collected from four
   captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) before and after anesthetizations
   with Telazol(R)/Ketasat(R) Tests of assay validity indicated that
   cortisol was measurable in chimpanzee fecal extracts, Fecal cortisol
   concentrations were significantly elevated 2 days after anesthetization,
   with elevations in seven of the eight treatments, The posttreatment peak
   was significantly greater than baseline values in three of the four
   subjects. Both fecal concentrations and proportionate increases in
   response to stress were significantly correlated with the corresponding
   values in urinary cortisol, confirming the stressfulness of these
   procedures and the stress responsiveness of fecal cortisol, These
   findings provide evidence for the application of fecal cortisol as a
   noninvasive index of physiologic stress in nonhuman primates. (C) 1998

Title = {Habitat Degradation and Seasonality Affect Physiological Stress Levels
   of Eulemur collaris in Littoral Forest Fragments},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},

Month = {SEP 17},
Abstract = {The littoral forest on sandy soil is among the most threatened habitats
   in Madagascar and, as such, it represents a hot-spot within a
   conservation hot-spot. Assessing the health of the resident lemur fauna
   is not only critical for the long-term viability of these populations,
   but also necessary for the future re-habilitation of this unique
   habitat. Since the Endangered collared brown lemur, Eulemur collaris, is
   the largest seed disperser of the Malagasy south-eastern littoral forest
   its survival in this habitat is crucial. In this study we compared fecal
   glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) levels, a measure of physiological
   stress and potential early indicator of population health, between
   groups of collared brown lemurs living in a degraded forest fragment and
   groups occurring in a more preserved area. For this, we analysed 279
   fecal samples collected year-round from 4 groups of collared brown
   lemurs using a validated 11-oxoetiocholanolone enzyme immunoassay and
   tested if fGCM levels were influenced by reproductive stages,
   phenological seasons, sex, and habitat degradation. The lemurs living in
   the degraded forest had significantly higher fGCM levels than those
   living in the more preserved area. In particular, the highest fGCM
   levels were found during the mating season in all animals and in females
   during gestation in the degraded forest. Since mating and gestation are
   both occurring during the lean season in the littoral forest, these
   results likely reflect a combination of ecological and reproductive
   pressures. Our findings provide a clear indication that habitat
   degradation has additive effects to the challenges found in the natural
   habitat. Since increased stress hormone output may have long-term
   negative effects on population health and reproduction, our data
   emphasize the need for and may add to the development of effective
   conservation plans for the species.},

Abstract = {Sexual dimorphism in body size and canine weaponry is commonly
   associated with high levels of male-male competition. When group living
   species do not rely heavily on male-male competition for access to
   females, sperm competition may represent a viable alternative strategy.
   Unlike most haplorhine primates, lemurs are typically monomorphic in
   body weight and canine height. We assessed variability of body mass
   dimorphism and canine size dimorphism in brown lemurs using morphometric
   data from 3 populations in southeastern Madagascar: Eulemur fulvus
   rufus, E. albocollaris, and hybrids of the species. We found significant
   male-biased canine dimorphism in E. albocollaris in conjunction with
   body-size monomorphism. We observed similar patterns in the hybrids, but
   E. fulvus rufus exhibited significant female-biased size dimorphism and
   canine monomorphism. Testes volume was relatively high across study
   populations. Thus, sperm competition appears to be strong in brown
   lemurs. E. albocollaris males combine sperm competition with large
   canines, but not higher body mass, indicating a difference in sexual
   strategy from most lemurs. Patterns of body mass and canine size
   dimorphism are not uniform across brown lemur populations, indicating
   that future work on these populations can explicitly test models that
   predict relationships between size dimorphism and various types of
   competition.},

Title = {Androgen and glucocorticoid levels reflect seasonally occurring social

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {62},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Intense reproductive competition and social instability are assumed to
   increase concentrations of glucocorticoids and androgens in vertebrates,
   as a means of coping with these challenges. In seasonally breeding
   redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus), the mating and the birth
   season and the associated increased male competition are predicted to
   pose such reproductive challenges. In this paper, we investigate
   seasonal variation in hormone excretion in male redfronted lemurs, and
   examine whether this variation is associated with social or ecological
   factors. Although dominance status has been shown to affect individual
   stress levels across many taxa, we predicted no rank-related differences
   in glucocorticoids for redfronted lemurs because relatively equal costs
   are associated with both high and low rank positions (based on patterns
   of rank acquisition/maintenance and threats toward subordinates). Over a
   14-month period, we collected behavioral data (1843 focal hours) and 617
   fecal samples from 13 redfronted lemur males in Kirindy
   Forest/Madagascar. We found no general rank-related pattern of
   testosterone or glucocorticoid excretion in this species. Both hormones
   were excreted at significantly higher levels during the mating and the
   birth season, despite social stability during both periods. The elevated
   mating season levels may be explained by increased within-group
   reproductive competition during this time and are in line with previous
   studies of other seasonally reproducing primates. For the birth season
   increase, we propose that the predictable risk of infanticide in this
   highly seasonal species affects male gonadal and adrenal endocrine
   activity. We evaluate alternative social and ecological factors
   influencing the production of both hormone classes and conclude based on
   our preliminary investigations that none of them can account for the
   observed pattern.},

Title = {Intrasexual selection and testis size in strepsirhine primates},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-19},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {The main objective of this study was to investigate two predictions of
   sexual selection theory concerning interspecific variation in testis
   size among strepsirhine primates (Lemuriformes and Lorisiformes). First,
   the unique evolutionary history of lemurs provides an opportunity for an
   independent test of the predictions of sperm competition theory
   regarding the relationship between mating system and relative testis
   size. Second, I examined the evolutionary relationship between the
   morphological correlates of pre- and postcopulatory competition (i.e.,
   between sexual dimorphism and testis size) because polygamous lemurs, in
   contrast to other polygamous primates, lack sexual dimorphism. Based on
   measurements from 174 captive strepsirhines from 24 species, I found
   that multi-mate species had significantly larger testes than pair-living
   ones, but that they did not differ significantly from solitary species.
   This result deviates from theoretical expectations, but may be the
   result of yet-unknown heterogeneity in mechanisms of male-male
   competition in both multi-male and solitary species. There was no
   difference in relative testis size between nonmonogamous lemurs and
   lorises, indicating that presumably lower levels of precopulatory
   competition are not necessarily compensated by more intense sperm
   competition. Body size and phylogenetic effects were also found to
   considerably affect interspecific variability in testis size. Analyses
   of independent contrasts revealed that evolutionary changes in mating
   system, testis size, sexual size, and canine dimorphism were not, or
   only weakly: associated in this monophyletic group of primates.
   Additional comprehensive comparative studies of sexual dimorphism,
   testis size, mating system, and copulatory behavior in these and other
   taxa are indicated to illuminate general patterns and causes of
   covariation among these traits.},

Abstract = {We combined data on gut-passage times, feeding, and movement to explore
   the patterns of seed dispersal by Eulemur rubriventer, Eulemur
   rufrifrons, and Varecia variegata editorum lemurs in Ranomafana National

   Long-distance dispersal (>500m) was rare and average dispersal distances
   were short relative to those reported of similar-sized haplorrhine
   primates. The three lemur species showed no significant differences in
   mean seed-dispersal distances. However, they differed in the shape of
   their frequency distributions of seed-dispersal distances as a result of
   differences in how they moved through their habitats. The short
   distances of seed dispersal we observed and the depauperate frugivorous
   fauna in Madagascar suggest seed-dispersal may be more limited than in

Abstract = {The future of Madagascar's forests and their resident lemurs is
   precarious. Determining how species respond to forest fragmentation is
   essential for management efforts. We use stable isotope biogeochemistry
   to investigate how disturbance affects resource partitioning between two
   genera of cheirogaleid lemurs (Cheirogaleus and Microcebus) from three
   humid forest sites: continuous and fragmented forest at Tsinjoarivo, and
   selectively logged forest at Ranomafana. We test three hypotheses: (H1)
   cheirogaleids are unaffected by forest fragmentation, (H2) species
   respond individually to disturbance and may exploit novel resources in
   fragmented habitat, and (H3) species alter their behavior to rely on the
   same key resource in disturbed forest. We find significant isotopic
   differences among species and localities. Carbon data suggest that
   Microcebus feed lower in the canopy than Cheirogaleus at all three
   localities and that sympatric Cheirogaleus crossleyi and C. sibreei feed
   at different canopy heights in the fragmented forest. Microcbus have
   higher nitrogen isotope values than Cheirogaleus at all localities,
   indicating more faunivory. After accounting for baseline isotope values
   in plants, our results provide the most support for H3. We find similar
   isotopic variations among localities for both genera. Small differences
   in carbon among localities may reflect shifts in diet or habitat use.
   Elevated nitrogen values for cheirogaleid lemurs in fragments may
   reflect increased arthropod consumption or nutritional stress. These
   results suggest that cheirogaleids are affected by forest disturbance in
   Eastern Madagascar and stress the importance of accounting for baseline
   isotopic differences in plants in any work comparing localities.},

Title = {The Association of Intergroup Encounters, Dominance Status, and Fecal
   Androgen and Glucocorticoid Profiles in Wild Male White-Faced Capuchins
   (Cebus capucinus)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {75},
Number = {2},
Pages = {107-115},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Androgens play a role in male reproductive competition, frequently via
   aggression, while glucocorticoids are associated with the stress
   response. However, the relationships of these hormones with different
   sources of competition (intra- vs. intergroup) and dominance status are
   highly variable. Here, we consider the fecal androgen (fA) and
   glucocorticoid (fGC) profiles of alpha and subordinate male Cebus
   capucinus in the context of intergroup competition during a rare period
   of low intragroup competition (i.e. all females were either pregnant or
   lactating). Intergroup encounters (IGEs) are a long-term reproductive
   strategy in male white-faced capuchins, enabling them to assess the
   composition of neighboring groups. IGEs pose a threat to resident males
   as these can result in injury or death, loss of dominance rank, group
   eviction, and group takeovers that are frequently associated with
   infanticide. From February to July 2007, fecal samples were collected
   from eight males in three groups of white-faced capuchins in the Santa
   Rosa Sector of the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, Costa Rica. IGE rate
   was positively associated with both fA and fGC levels, indicating that
   IGEs are perceived as reproductive challenges by resident males, and may
   be associated with elevated metabolic costs. Alpha males sire the
   majority of group offspring and, accordingly, the threat of IGEs to both
   future (via rank loss or eviction) and current (via infanticide)
   reproductive success is greater than for subordinate males. Consistent
   with this observation, alpha males had higher fA and fGC levels than
   subordinate males. Given that all females were either pregnant or
   lactating and pronounced overt intragroup competition was absent, we
   interpret the difference in hormone profiles of alpha and subordinate
   males as being primarily associated with variation in the perceived
   threats of IGEs according to dominance status. Future studies should
   focus on the interaction of intra- and intergroup competition by
   examining hormone levels in the presence of periovulatory females. Am.

Abstract = {In this study we investigated the importance of biparental care for the
   evolution and/or maintenance of pair-living in red-tailed sportive
   lemurs (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), a nocturnal folivorous lemur. Between
   2000 and 2005, we collected data on life history traits from a total of
   14 radio-collared pairs of adults and their offspring in Kirindy forest,
   western Madagascar. Predation rate varied between years with a minimum
   of 0\% and a maximum of 40\% per year. Patterns of parental care were
   quantified during simultaneous focal observations of both pair-partners
   in 2003 and 2004. Mating activity was limited to the months of May and
   June, as indicated by conspicuous changes of vulval morphology and male
   mate guarding behavior. After a gestation length of about 5 months,
   which is much longer than expected for a lemur of this body mass, single
   infants were born in November. Lactation lasted for about 50 days. Apart
   from lactation, females provided infant care by warming, grooming and
   transporting infants orally. Infants were parked in dense vegetation
   while females foraged. Males were seen only rarely in proximity to
   infants and we found no evidence for direct infant care provided by
   social fathers. We conclude that the necessity of direct infant care
   cannot explain the evolution and/or maintenance of pair-living in
   Lepilemur ruficaudatus.},

Title = {Spatial distribution and population composition of the brown mouse lemur

Abstract = {Through a 16-mo mark-recapture trap study, I examined aspects of spatial
   distribution and population composition in the brown mouse lemur,
   Microcebus rufus, a 42 g nocturnal strepsirhine. The study took place in
   the rainforest of Ranomafana National Park in southeastern Madagascar.
   Sherman live traps were set monthly for a variable number of nights in a
   quasi-grid 50 m apart. Captured individuals were marked for future
   identification and released at site of capture. More males than females
   were captured overall (102 versus 72) and at 83\% of trap sites. Trap
   sex ratio fluctuated significantly over the course of the study. It was
   particularly male-biased between June and August (3.9:1), when more
   previously uncaptured males than females (14 versus 6) entered the trap
   population. Some of these males remained in the trap population.
   Although the average number of individuals captured was not
   significantly different between the first four and last four months of
   the study, the composition of the population changed. The female
   population, however, changed less: 28.9\% of all females captured in the
   first four months of the study were recaptured in the last four months,
   compared to 9.7\% of males. It is suggested that the pattern of
   appearance of new individuals and disappearance of others, both
   predominantly male, may indicate migratory activity. Furthermore, an
   average of eight individuals were captured at each trap site (similar to
   70\% of traps captured more than five), suggesting a high degree of
   spatial overlap. The average number of male and female individuals
   captured in each trap (5.5 males versus 2.5 females), the average number
   of trap sites at which males and females were captured (3.6 versus 2.4),
   and the average number of captures for males and females (9.8 versus
   5.7) all differed significantly between the sexes. Am. J. Primatol.

Title = {Seasonal and social influences on fecal androgen and glucocorticoid
   excretion in wild male long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis)},
Journal = {PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {98},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {168-175},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Whereas it is well known that in strictly seasonal breeding primates
   (income breeders), alike other vertebrates, males show pronounced
   changes in testicular and adrenal hormone levels concurrent with
   reproductive activity, hormonal patterns in males of non-strictly
   seasonal breeding primate species (capital breeders) and their relation
   to seasonal and social correlates remain largely unknown. In the present
   study, we examined the annual pattern of fecal androgen and
   glucocorticoid excretion and their relationship to environmental
   (rainfall, temperature) and social factors (number of cycling females,
   male aggression and copulation rates, male dominance rank) in a group of
   wild long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis), a species with a
   moderate degree of reproductive seasonality and classified as capital
   breeder. The study was carried out in the Gunung Leuser National Park,
   North Sumatra. Indonesia over a period of ten months encompassing the
   conception and the birth season. Our results show that male long-tailed
   macaques exhibit a distinct annual variation in both androgen and
   glucocorticoid levels. Androgen (but not glucocorticoid) levels were
   significantly elevated during the conception period in association with
   elevated rates of male-male aggression and copulatory activity, both
   strongly related to the number of cycling females in the group. Neither
   glucocorticoid nor androgen levels were related to male dominance rank
   or to the environmental parameters investigated. Interestingly, levels
   of both hormones started to increase in the late birth season and thus
   1-2 months prior to the mating season, suggesting that male long-tailed
   macaques go through pre-breeding hormonal changes in preparation for
   prospective challenges. Our data thus provide the first evidence that
   males of a non-strictly seasonal breeding species/capital breeder show
   endocrine patterns generally similar to those found in strictly
   seasonal/income breeders. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The biogeography of large islands, or how does the size of the

Journal = {REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {62},

Abstract = {We compare selected aspects of the biotas of long-isolated islands
   ranging in size from Reunion to early Pliocene South America, focusing
   on Madagascar, New Zealand, New Caledonia and the Hawaiian Islands.
   Although Madagascar and New Zealand were joined to larger land masses
   less than 90 million years ago, their biotas arc overwhelmingly
   dominated by descendants of colonists from overseas. The size of a
   long-isolated land mass decisively influences major features of its
   ecosystem. On smaller islands, extinction is more likely, colonization
   is rarer, and there are fewer opportunities for diversification. The
   largest herbivores and the largest carnivores are smaller on smaller
   islands. Reduced diversity, lower predation pressure and diminished
   evolutionary innovation reduce the severity of competition on smaller
   islands: their plants are less well defended against vertebrate
   herbivores, and their primary productivity is lower, while their annuals
   are longer-lived, less fecund, and have lower basal metabolism than
   mainland ecological counterparts. Herbivores arc most likely to evolve
   convergently with counterparts on other land masses with predators of
   similar size and/or efficiency. Thus sloth lemurs converged on tree
   sloths, Megaladapis on koalas, and moa-nalos on moas and elephant birds.
   The degree of an island's isolation also affects its ecosystem's
   characteristics. More isolated islands receive fewer immigrants, so
   diversity is lower on more isolated islands, especially small islands
   with high risks of extinction. Fewer mainland immigrants, whose
   efficiency was tested against a variety of competitors and well-defended
   prey, reach more isolated islands, so competition is less intense on
   these islands, and these islands' predators are less efficient. Smaller
   size and greater isolation therefore make a land mass more invasible.
   Islands with the fewest predators and the slowest pace of life are most
   likely to be catastrophically disrupted by mainland invaders. All these
   phenomena have analogues in human economies. As a rule, economies with
   higher total production support more intense competition, more
   innovation, a greater diversity of occupations, a faster pace of life,
   and greater productivity per capita.},

Title = {Trends in forest fragment research in Madagascar: Documented responses

Abstract = {The rise in research investigating fragmentation and its impact on
   primates and other taxa reflects the growing presence of fragmented
   landscapes themselves. Although numerous studies report the negative
   effects of fragmentation on biodiversity, it is difficult to generalize
   responses to fragmentation for specific taxonomic groups, such as
   non-human primates, when studies have not employed a definitive concept
   of fragmentation or fragments themselves. Madagascar's high degree of
   fragmentation, wealth of endemic taxa, and extensive history of
   ecological research provide the opportunity to compare fragmentation
   studies across similar contexts. We conducted a literature search of
   peer-reviewed articles on fragmentation in Madagascar to characterize
   its trends. A total of 70 articles, 46 of which concentrated on lemurs,
   tested the impacts of fragmentation on Malagasy taxa, while additional
   sources conducted research in one or more fragments without testing its
   effects (n = 112 total, 79 on lemurs). Studies on lemurs most frequently
   tested fragmentation's impacts on genetics and biodiversity metrics (n =
   16 and 15 studies, respectively), although health, modeling, behavioral,
   and cross-disciplinary techniques were also reported. Responses to
   fragmentation were reported for 49 lemur species, with most studies
   concentrated in eastern Madagascar (87\%). Although there was variation
   in the metrics reported in studies testing the effects of fragmentation
   on Malagasy species, the most common measures were fragment area,
   isolation, or comparison to a control site. Landscape-scale approaches
   and examination of fragmentation per se were rarely employed.
   Characterizing trends of fragmentation research in Madagascar emphasizes
   the challenges of documenting fragmentation's effects while highlighting
   the benefits of research within fragmented landscapes, particularly when
   combined with consideration for how the matrix within human-modified
   landscapes may impact primate populations.},

Title = {Endocrine characterization of female reproductive status in wild
   redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus)},
Journal = {GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {131},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In order to characterize the endocrine changes associated with ovarian
   function and pregnancy in wild redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus),
   profiles of immunoreactive 5alpha-pregnane-3alpha-ol-20-one (5-P-30H)
   and total estrogens (E-t) in feces were generated during the breeding
   season and gestation. HPLC data confirmed the presence of high amounts
   of 5-P-30H in the feces of redfronted lemurs and showed that estrone and
   estradiol-17beta were the major estrogens excreted into feces, with
   estrone predominating. Due to an extreme day-to-day variability in
   excretion of both hormones during the breeding season, estrus cycle
   characterization was not possible for the free-ranging females.
   Comparison with endocrine data from captive animals suggested that this
   might have been associated with a highly variable amount of undigested
   fecal matter in the feces of wild females. A gestation length of 121.3
   days was calculated on the basis of the day of behavioral estrus and
   date of parturition. Hormonally, pregnancy could be reliably diagnosed
   from day 40-45 after conception, when fecal progestogen levels clearly
   increased above breeding season concentrations in all females. Levels
   gradually increased thereafter, with 15- to 35-fold elevated maximum
   levels being reached shortly before parturition. In contrast, the
   pattern of fecal estrogen excretion was strongly related to the sex of
   the fetus in utero, with only females carrying male infants showing
   elevated (25- to 50-fold) estrogen levels during the last third of
   gestation, while levels remained at low breeding season levels in
   female-carrying mothers. Thus, fecal estrogen measurements during the
   last 6-7 weeks of gestation allow fetal sex to be determined prenatally.
   By providing the first data on the reproductive endocrinology of E.
   fulvus, we have shown that fecal hormone analysis is a useful tool to
   monitor endocrine changes associated with pregnancy, while it appears to
   have certain limitations regarding the assessment of ovarian function.

Title = {Sex roles and adult sex ratios: insights from mammalian biology and

Journal = {PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {372},
Number = {1729},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {Theoretical models and empirical studies in various taxa have identified
   important links between variation in sex roles and the number of adult
   males and females (adult sex ratio (ASR)) in a population. In this
   review, I examine these relationships in non-human primates. Because
   most existing theoretical models of the evolution of sex roles focus on
   the evolutionary origins of sex-biased behaviour, they offer only a
   general scaffold for predicting variation in sex roles among and within
   species. I argue that studies examining sex role variation at these more
   specific levels need to take social organization into account to
   identify meaningful levels for the measurement of ASR and to account for
   the fact that ASR and sex roles mutually influence each other. Moreover,
   taxon-specific life-history traits can constrain sex role flexibility
   and impact the operational sex ratio (OSR) by specifying the minimum
   length of female time outs from reproduction. Using examples from the
   primate literature, I highlight practical problems in estimating ASR and
   OSR. I then argue that interspecific variation in the occurrence of
   indirect forms of paternal care might indeed be linked to variation in
   ASR. Some studies also indicate that female aggression and bonding, as
   well as components of intersexual relationships, are sensitive to
   variation in ASR. Thus, links between primate sex roles and sex ratios
   merit further study, and such studies could prompt the development of
   more specific theoretical models that make realistic assumptions about
   taxon-specific life history and social organization.},

Title = {Frugivory in Four Sympatric Lemurs: Implications for the Future of

Abstract = {Although some conservationists accept that not all species can be saved,
   we illustrate the difficulty in deciding which species are dispensable.
   In this article, we examine the possibility that the integrity of a
   forest relies on its entire faunal assemblage. In Madagascar, one faunal
   group, the lemurs, accounts for the greatest biomass and species
   richness among frugivores. For example, 7 of the 13 sympatric lemur
   species in Madagascar's eastern rainforests consume primarily fruit.
   Because of this, we suggest that some tree species may rely heavily on
   particular lemur taxa for both seed dispersal and germination. In
   Ranomafana National Park, the diets for four of the day-active lemur
   frugivores have been documented during annual cycles over a 5-year
   period. We predicted that, although the fruit of some plant taxa would
   be exploited by multiple lemur species, the fruit of others would be
   eaten by one lemur species alone. Analyses reveal that while lemurs
   overlap in a number of fruit taxa exploited, 46\% (16/35) of families
   and 56\% (29/52) of genera are eaten exclusively by one lemur species.
   We, therefore, predict local changes in forest composition and structure
   if certain of these lemur species are eliminated from a forest owing to
   hunting, disease, or habitat disturbance. We also suggest that this
   result may be of global significance because carbon sequestration by the
   tropical forests in Madagascar may be reduced as a result of this
   predicted change in forest composition. Am. J. Primatol. 73:585-602,

Abstract = {Mortality patterns are thought to be strong selective forces on life
   history traits, with high adult mortality and low immature mortality
   favoring early and rapid reproduction. Patas monkeys (Erythrocebus
   patas) have the highest potential rates of population increase for their
   body size of any haplorhine primate because they reproduce both earlier
   and more often. We report here 10 yr of comparative demographic data on
   a population of patas monkeys and a sympatric population of vervet
   monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops), a closely related species differing in
   aspects of social system, ecology, and life history. The data reveal
   that 1) adult female patas monkeys have significantly higher mortality
   than adult female vervets; 2) infant mortality in patas monkeys is
   relatively low compared to the norm for mammals because it is not
   significantly different from that of adult female patas monkeys; and 3)
   infant mortality is significantly higher than adult female mortality in
   vervets. For both species, much of the mortality could be attributed to
   predation. An epidemic illness was also a major contributor to the
   mortality of adult female patas monkeys whereas chronic exposure to
   pathogens in a cold and damp microenvironment may have contributed to
   the mortality of infant vervets. Both populations experienced large
   fluctuations during the study period. Our results support the prediction
   from demographic models of life history evolution that high adult
   mortality relative to immature mortality selects for early maturation.},

Abstract = {The persistence of tropical rainforests, together with their flora and
   fauna, is highly threatened by anthropogenic disturbances. In this
   study, we investigate to what extent selective logging influences the
   structure and composition of a tropical rainforest in Madagascar and
   subsequently lemur encounter rates and cluster sizes. We quantified
   forest structure variables and conducted transect surveys of seven
   sympatric diurnal lemur species in five protected forest sites with
   different logging histories. We found that DBH, tree height, the
   interquartile ranges of DBH and tree height (measure of forest
   heterogeneity), tree species and family richness were relatively high
   and tree density was relatively low in less disturbed compared to
   disturbed sites. Although the disturbed forests have not fully recovered
   to previous conditions, they seem to have recovered from a functional
   perspective into suitable lemur habitat, as lemur encounter rates and
   cluster sizes were similar in disturbed and less disturbed sites. We
   only found slightly higher encounter rates for Varecia variegate (P =
   0.078) and lower encounter rates for Eulernur rufifrons (P = 0.059) in
   less disturbed forests. This is one of the first studies that report the
   presence of V. variegate, a species characterised by its drastic
   decline, in previously logged sites. Lemurs travelling between disturbed
   and less disturbed sites disperse seeds and hereby facilitate forest
   regeneration. Therefore, we promote the need for better attention to the
   value of logged forests for biodiversity conservation in Madagascar and
   suggest that there is considerable potential for regenerating logged
   forests to support lemur communities.},

Title = {The Evolution of Eulemur Social Organization},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-28},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent comparative studies on the evolution of mammalian sociality came
   to opposite conclusions regarding the direction and drivers of
   evolutionary transitions in social organization, particularly concerning
   the evolution of pair-living among primates. Because the genus Eulemur
   is one of the few exceptional primate genera that contain both group-and
   pair-living species, eulemurs offer a rare opportunity to illuminate the
   processes driving social diversity among species with very similar life
   histories and ecologies. The aims of our study were therefore 1) to
   reconstruct the evolution of social organization in eulemurs with new
   demographic and phylogenetic data and 2) to evaluate several hypotheses
   about the evolution of pair-living with data from our long-term study of
   Eulemur rufifrons and published data on other eulemurs. Our review of
   published data confirmed that E. mongoz and E. rubriventer are
   pair-living, whereas the 10 other species of Eulemur live in groups with
   multiple adult males and females. Furthermore, pair-living evolved at
   least once among eulemurs from group-living ancestors. The available
   comparative evidence indicated that this evolutionary transition was
   probably not driven by male infanticide, social instability, or singular
   ecological factors. Instead, we propose that female competition has
   favored small female group size and that this effect may have been
   exacerbated by interspecific competition with sympatric congeners in the
   ancestors of the pair-living species. In conclusion, we confirmed that
   the evolution of pair-living from group-living ancestors among true
   lemurs is exceptional, but not unique, among mammals, and that commonly
   invoked hypotheses for the evolution of pair-living do not appear to be
   supported for this genus.},

Journal = {HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Pages = {105-113},

Abstract = {In polygynous mammals, where males compete over access to females, the
   potential of males to monopolize reproductive females largely depends on
   the spatio-temporal distribution of reproductive females. We
   investigated mechanisms of male reproductive competition and its
   hormonal basis in a cercopithecine species with reduced contest
   potential owing to female reproductive synchrony and concealed
   ovulation. Over 16 months including two mating seasons we collected 1218
   h of observational focal animal data and 1254 fecal samples of 11-12
   adult and large subadult male Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis)
   living in their natural habitat in Thailand. Androgen output along with
   aggressive behavior showed a seasonal pattern, with highest values being
   obtained by all males during the mating season and by those males
   experiencing acute social challenges, e.g. rank change and dispersal.
   Individual androgen levels and rates of attacks were linked across the
   study period, suggesting a promoting function of androgens for
   aggressive behavior. Dominance rank predicted neither mating success nor
   androgen levels consistently, indicating a reduced selective advantage
   of high social status for general mating access. However, high ranking
   males engaged in extended consortships with reproductive females.
   Distribution of consortships across males followed a priority of access
   distribution, with the two top ranking males accounting for 75\% of
   consort activity, suggesting that high social status also carries
   fitness benefits in a species characterized by low contest potential.

Title = {It's All in the Timing: Birth Seasonality and Infant Survival in Eulemur
   rubriventer},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Pages = {715-735},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Highly seasonal breeding has been considered one of the keys to
   understanding Malagasy primate socioecology. Strict seasonal breeding
   may be particularly critical for Malagasy primates because they live in
   such energetically challenging seasonal environments. Lemurs also live
   in highly unpredictable environments, and there is growing evidence that
   reproductive timing may be mediated by additional factors, suggesting
   that more relaxed breeding seasonality is adaptive in some cases. I
   tested the adaptive breadth of the birth peak in Eulemur rubriventer,
   which breed in several different months. I describe reproduction in the
   species by determining the timing and extent of the birth season (period
   in which all births occur) and birth peak (period in which the majority
   of births occur); test whether relaxed reproductive seasonality might
   increase reproductive success by comparing infant mortality within and
   outside the birth peak; and model the extent to which fruit availability
   has an influence on the timing of reproduction. I collected birth data
   on 5 groups in 2003-2005, which I combined with demographic data that D.
   Overdorff collected from 5 focal groups and additional censused groups
   between 1988 and 1996. Thirty births occurred in 8 different months.
   Births were significantly seasonal, with a unimodal birth peak in late
   August/September/October, and a mean birth date of October 11.
   Twenty-three births (76.7\%) occurred within 54 d (14.79\%) of the year.
   No births occurred May-July, indicating that conceptions did not occur
   from late December through late February, and cycling (estimated using
   gestation length) did not occur until ca. 101 d after the austral summer
   solstice (December 21). Of 22 infants followed regularly, 18 were born
   in the birth peak, of which 2 died (11\%). All 4 infants born out of
   season died. Based on fruit availability, I calculated a Theoretical
   Overlap index (T), which indicated a 3-mo window with optimal food
   conditions for reproduction. This window corresponded to the timing and
   breadth of the birth peak in Eulemur rubriventer. These results indicate
   that a breeding season > 3 mo within a given year is not adaptive in the
   species, likely due in large part to the availability of fruit during
   key reproductive stages, particularly before breeding.},

Abstract = {Activity budget comparisons between groups or individuals in the wild
   and those in captivity are commonly used to determine the range of
   wild-type behaviors that nonhuman animals in captivity perform. These
   comparisons are conducted with the view that individuals displaying a
   greater range of wild-type behaviors have enhanced welfare. Such
   comparisons have a greater appeal when it comes to primates because
   increased levels of anthropomorphism toward primates lead to welfare
   concerns. However, the validity of such comparisons has not been
   assessed. From the reviewed literature, some of the main complexities
   identified when defining ``good welfare{''} using activity budgets were
   the ideas of behavioral motivation and adaptation, obstacles when using
   the wild as a benchmark for good welfare, study methods causing possible
   variances in behavior, and social and environmental factors. It is
   proposed that such influencing factors would be controlled for
   adequately in future studies with the use of multiple indices to measure
   welfare and methods that infer positive emotional states. It is hoped we
   can then build evidence of an animal's emotional state and allow welfare
   to be inferred to a higher degree.},

Volume = {161},

Abstract = {Objectives: The proximate and ultimate determinants that may have
   prompted some primates to shift from an arboreal to terrestrial feeding
   niche, whether due to environmental change, seasonality, and/or
   predation pressure, are poorly understood. Within a fragmented littoral
   forest in southeast Madagascar, an arboreal strepsirrhine population
   spends a large proportion of time on the ground, thus we aimed to
   identify which factors influence terrestrial feeding.
   Methods: From January to December 2013, we conducted 103 full-day focal
   follows on three social groups of southern bamboo lemurs H.
   meridionalis. We continuously recorded feeding time on all arboreal and
   terrestrial items, as well as whether the focal individual was under the
   canopy or exposed, and the distance to their nearest conspecific
   neighbor. All observed food items were collected and analyzed for
   macronutrient content. Daily climatic variables (temperature,
   precipitation), resource seasonality, daily path length (DPL), along
   with dietary and predation risk proxies, were used as fixed effects in a
   linear mixed model, with the daily proportion of terrestrial feeding as
   the dependent variable.
   Results: Our model indicated that daily terrestrial feeding increased at
   cooler temperature, was associated with reduced DPL, and the intake of
   dietary metabolizable energy increased as terrestrial feeding increased.
   All other fixed effects were not significant predictors.
   Discussion: Our study provides a window into the ultimate determinants
   of niche expansion: ancestral primates, in absence of their primary
   resources, may have initially descended to the ground in peripheral
   population range areas where the benefits (eg., nutritional pay-off)
   out-weighed the costs.},

Abstract = {Folivory has evolved in all primate radiations but the relative
   importance of resource quantity and nutritional quality of food is
   controversial. To understand how food abundance and different nutrients
   affect a folivorous diet, we investigated food composition of the
   leaf-eating lemur Avahi meridionalis. From June to December 2004, we
   conducted 26 nights of focal observation (256.1 h) in Sainte Luce
   pluvial littoral forest (southeast Madagascar) and recorded feeding
   behavior of 4 radiocollared individuals. Within the subjects' home
   ranges, we recorded vegetation characteristics (morphospecies,
   phenology, diameter at breast height) and sampled food and nonfood items
   for chemical analyses. A. meridionalis did not eat fruit but only leaves
   and flowers and did not base their choice on food abundance. Adult
   leaves eaten were higher in easily soluble protein than adult leaves
   that were not consumed. The subjects ate young leaves and flowers as
   soon as they became available. These young leaves contained the same
   concentrations of soluble protein, higher concentrations of crude
   protein, and lower concentrations of acid detergent fiber and sugar than
   mature food leaves. A. meridionalis ate leaves with condensed tannins,
   alkaloids, and intermediate concentrations of polyphenolics. Contrary to
   previous studies that considered Avahi spp. a specialist, A.
   meridionalis acted as leaf-eating generalists with moderate selectivity,
   based on nutritional quality and tolerance of a wide array of plant
   secondary metabolites. This illustrates the dietary flexibility within a
   single genus of primates that seems to be driven by environmental
   constraints rather than morphological or physiological adaptations.},

Abstract = {Lemurs, lorises, and tarsiers are socially and ecologically diverse
   primates that include some of the most endangered mammals. We review
   results of long-term studies of 15 lemur species from 7 sites in
   Madagascar and 1 species each of loris and tarsier in Indonesia. We
   emphasize that the existence of long-term study populations is a crucial
   prerequisite for planning and conducting shorter studies on specific
   topics, as exemplified by various ecophysiological studies of lemurs.
   Extended studies of known individuals have revealed variation in social
   organization within and between ecologically similar species. Even for
   these primates with relatively fast life histories, it required more
   than a decade of paternity data to characterize male reproductive skew.
   The long-term consequences of female rank on reproductive success remain
   poorly known, however. Long-term monitoring of known individuals is the
   only method to obtain data on life-history adaptations, which appear to
   be shaped by predation in the species covered here; long-term studies
   are also needed for addressing particular questions in community
   ecology. The mere presence of long-term projects has a positive effect
   on the protection of study sites, and they generate unique data that are
   fundamental to conservation measures, such as close monitoring of
   populations.},

Title = {Female reproductive competition in Eulemur rufifrons: eviction and
   reproductive restraint in a plurally breeding Malagasy primate},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY},

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {In mammals with female philopatry, co-resident females inevitably
   compete with each other for resources or reproductive opportunities,
   thereby reducing the kin-selected benefits of altruism towards
   relatives. These counteracting forces of cooperation and competition
   among kin should be particularly pronounced in plurally breeding species
   with limited alternative breeding opportunities outside the natal group.
   However, little is still known about the costs of reproductive
   competition on females fitness and the victims potential
   counter-strategies. Here we summarize long-term behavioural, demographic
   and genetic data collected on a plurally breeding primate from
   Madagascar to illuminate mechanisms and effects of female reproductive
   competition, focusing on forcible eviction and potential reproductive
   restraint. The main results of our study indicate that females in groups
   of redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) above a critical size suffer
   from competition from their close relatives: females in larger groups
   face an increased probability of not giving birth as well as a higher
   probability of being evicted, especially during the annual mating and
   birth seasons. Eviction is not predicted by the number of adult females,
   the number of close female relatives, female age or inter-annual
   variation in rainfall but only by total group size. Thus, eviction in
   this species is clearly linked with reproductive competition, it cannot
   be forestalled by reproductive restraint or having many relatives in the
   group, and it occurs in the absence of a clear dominance hierarchy. Our
   study therefore also underscores the notion that potential inclusive
   fitness benefits from living with relatives may have been generally
   over-rated and should not be taken for granted.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the correlates of variation in dental development
   across the order Primates. We are particularly interested in how 1)
   dental precocity (percentage of total postcanine primary and secondary
   teeth that have erupted at selected absolute ages and life cycle stages)
   and 2) dental endowment at weaning (percentage of adult postcanine
   occlusal area that is present at weaning) are related to variation in
   body or brain size and diet in primates. We ask whether folivores have
   more accelerated dental schedules than do like-sized frugivores, and if
   so, to what extent this is part and parcel of a general pattern of
   acceleration of life histories in more folivorous taxa. What is the
   adaptive significance of variation in dental eruption schedules across
   the order Primates? We show that folivorous primate species tend to
   exhibit more rapid dental development ton an absolute scale) than
   comparably sized frugivores, and their dental development tends to be
   more advanced at weaning. Our data affirm an important role for brain
   (rather than body) size as a predictor of both absolute and relative
   dental development. Tests of alternative dietary hypotheses offer the
   strongest support for the foraging independence and food processing
   hypotheses. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Patterns of behavior across reproductive states of free-ranging female

Abstract = {Reports on the behavior of spider monkeys (genus Ateles) describe a
   suite of 5-6 behaviors that are indicative of an estrous female. This
   study presents hormonal data as an independent measure of reproductive
   state to determine if these behaviors are associated with any particular
   reproductive state or stage of the ovarian cycle. Fecal samples
   collected from 6 free-ranging female black-handed spider monkeys (Ateles
   geoffroyi) over the course of 11 months were assayed for estrogen (E1C)
   and progesterone (PdG) metabolites, using an enzyme immunoassay.
   Behavioral data collected from the same females were analyzed for
   patterns associated with different reproductive states. A more detailed
   analysis of behavioral data associated with reproductively cycling
   periods determined whether each behavior clustered with copulations or a
   particular phase in the ovarian cycle. Observations of place-sniffing
   were more frequent for 4 of 5 females when reproductively cycling. Of
   all copulations observed, 80\% occurred when the female participant was
   reproductively cycling. In addition, the rates of self-clitoral hold and
   self-clitoral rub behaviors were significantly higher for 2 of 4 and 4
   of 5 of females, respectively, when reproductively cycling. No behavior
   consistently occurred in association with copulations or with any
   particular phase in the ovarian cycle. Results from this study suggest
   that the behaviors tested in this paper can provide some information
   regarding female spider monkey reproductive state (whether or not she is
   reproductively cycling), but that they are not indicators of estrus in
   female spider monkeys. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {In this study, we compare the life-history patterns of male and female
   Eulemur fulvus rufus based on longitudinal data collected on individuals
   from two study groups from 1988-1998 in southeastern Madagascar Mean
   group size was 9.5 individuals, and groups either contained more adult
   males than females or equal numbers of both sexes. Females reproduced
   for the first time between 2 and 4 years of age and reproduced each
   gear, although the mean interbirth interval between surviving offspring
   was 2.1 years. An average of two adult females reproduced annually in
   each social group, and age and body weight may positively influence
   reproductive success. Females also appear ts be philopatric but Plot
   female-bonded. Young natal males immigrated between 3 and 4.5 years of
   age and may join a new group within 6-12 months based on the age of
   emigrants. Once in a social group, they remained until old age, although
   a male's spatial position in the social group varied with age. Young
   nonnatal males were members of the social core and had the first
   opportunity to mate with all estrous females. Older males were
   peripheral to the social group and mated with females later in their
   cycle. We hypothesize that group size, the number of females in the
   group, and individual variation in reproductive success is influenced by
   several ecological conditions at this site: extreme variability in food
   availability during reproductive periods, the lack of large food
   patches, low plant species diversity and small numbers of important
   aseasonal food sources such as Ficus species, (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Explaining geographical variation in the isotope composition of mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2106-2121},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Aim We sought to quantify geographical variation in the stable isotope
   values of mouse lemurs (Microcebus) and to determine whether this
   variation reflects trophic differences among populations or baseline
   isotopic differences among habitats. If the latter pattern is
   demonstrated, then Microcebus can become a proxy for tracking baseline
   habitat isotopic variability. Establishing such a baseline is crucial
   for identifying niche partitioning in modern and ancient communities.
   Location We studied five species of Microcebus from eight distinct
   habitats across Madagascar.
   Methods We compared isotopic variation in C-3 plants and Microcebus fur
   within and among localities. We predicted that carbon and nitrogen
   isotope values of Microcebus should: (1) vary as a function of abiotic
   variables such as rainfall and temperature, and (2) covary with isotopic
   values in plants. We checked for trophic differences among Microcebus
   populations by comparing the average difference between mouse lemur and
   plant isotope values for each locality. We then used multiple regression
   models to explain spatial isotope variation in mouse lemurs, testing a
   suite of explanatory abiotic variables.
   Results We found substantial isotopic variation geographically. Ranges
   for mean isotope values were similar for both Microcebus and plants
   across localities (carbon 3.5-4.0 parts per thousand; nitrogen 10.5-11.0
   parts per thousand). Mean mouse lemur and plant isotope values were
   lowest in cool, moist localities and highest in hot, dry localities.
   Rainfall explained 58\% of the variation in Microcebus carbon isotope
   values, and mean plant nitrogen isotope values explained 99.7\% of the
   variation in Microcebus nitrogen isotope values. Average differences
   between mouse lemur and plant isotope values (carbon 5.0 parts per
   thousand; nitrogen 5.9 parts per thousand) were similar across
   localities.
   Main conclusions Isotopic data suggest that trophic differences among
   Microcebus populations were small. Carbon isotope values in mouse lemurs
   were negatively correlated with rainfall. Nitrogen isotope values in
   Microcebus and plants covaried. Such findings suggest that nitrogen
   isotope values for Microcebus are a particularly good proxy for tracking
   baseline isotopic differences among habitats. Our results will
   facilitate future comparative research on modern mouse lemur
   communities, and ecological interpretations of extinct Holocene
   communities.},

Title = {The influence of growth patterns on sexual size monomorphism in lemurs},

Abstract = {The lack of sexual size dimorphism among lemurs is puzzling given the
   high degree of polygyny in this clade. It has been proposed that the
   unique ecological conditions of Madagascar favour rapid completion of
   growth, limiting the opportunities for bimaturism and sexual size
   dimorphism in lemurs. Using recently compiled large data sets on many
   species across the lemur clade, I examined the prevalence of sexual size
   monomorphism of body mass among lemurs and tested the hypothesis that
   limited growth durations constrain sexual size dimorphism. I used
   segmented regression analyses to accurately model growth in each
   species. The majority of species analysed exhibited a period of rapid
   growth followed by a distinct period of slow growth prior to attainment
   of adult body mass. Whereas the first period of growth was constrained
   by the need to attain the majority of adult body mass prior to the onset
   of the infant's first dry season, the subsequent period of slow growth
   was unconstrained and sufficiently long to promote sexual bimaturism.
   Sex differences in the duration and rate of growth during this second
   growth phase appeared to account for the sexual size dimorphism
   exhibited by three lemur species. Therefore, constraints on growth
   processes do not limit sexual size dimorphism in lemurs, and other
   explanations for the prevalence of sexual size monomorphism in this
   clade should be examined. The importance of considering ontogeny in
   future investigations of sexual size monomorphism in lemurs is
   highlighted.},

Abstract = {Understanding the paleoecology of extinct subfossil lemurs requires
   reconstruction of dietary preferences. Tooth morphology is strongly
   correlated with diet in living primates and is appropriate for inferring
   dietary ecology. Recently, dental topographic analysis has shown great
   promise in reconstructing diet from molar tooth form. Compared with
   traditionally used shearing metrics, dental topography is better suited
   for the extraordinary diversity of tooth form among subfossil lemurs and
   has been shown to be less sensitive to phylogenetic sources of shape
   variation. Specifically, we computed orientation patch counts rotated
   (OPCR) and Dirichlet normal energy (DNE) of molar teeth belonging to 14
   species of subfossil lemurs and compared these values to those of an
   extant lemur sample. The two metrics succeeded in separating species in
   a manner that provides insights into both food processing and diet. We
   used them to examine the changes in lemur community ecology in Southern
   and Southwestern Madagascar that accompanied the extinction of giant
   lemurs. We show that the poverty of Madagascar's frugivore community is
   a long-standing phenomenon and that extinction of large-bodied lemurs in
   the South and Southwest resulted not merely in a loss of guild elements
   but also, most likely, in changes in the ecology of extant lemurs. Am J

Abstract = {The removal, or absence, of predatory species could be a contributing
   proximate factor to the rise of primate cathemerality. But predators
   themselves can also be cathemeral, so cathemerality could well be an
   evolutionary stable strategy. From a comparative perspective, it appears
   that the effect of predatory species cannot provide a unitary
   explanation for cathemerality. Varying distributions and population
   densities of predators, especially raptors, may be key factors in owl
   monkey ( Aotus) cathemerality, but temperature and lunar cycle variation
   have also been implicated. In Madagascar, while raptors are potential
   predators of lemur species, the cathemerality of Eulemur species
   coincides with that of the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), a major predatory
   threat to lemurs. Thus, lemurid cathemerality may be more parsimoniously
   explained as an evolutionary stable strategy. Copyright (c) 2006 S.

   in the most fundamental way in the evolution of solitary, pair-living
   and group-living species, but deviate in several respects within these
   basic categories of social organization. Solitary lemurs remain poorly
   studied, but their social organization appears to be broadly similar to
   that of other solitary primates, even though the unexpected lack. of
   sexual dimorphism may indicate that similar types of social organization
   can give rise to different mating systems. The determinants of a
   solitary lifestyle remain elusive. Pair-living lemurs show striking
   convergences with other monogamous primates in several behavioural
   traits, but also deviate in that the majority of species are at least
   partly nocturnal and do not exhibit direct paternal care of dependent
   young. Group-living lemurs have not evolved single-male groups,
   male-bonded and multi-level societies, and polyandrous groups may also
   be lacking. Female philopatry is common, but female bonds are generally
   weakly developed and eviction of females from natal groups is not
   unusual. Group-living lemurs also differ from anthropoids in that their
   groups have even adult sex ratios, smaller average size and may split up
   on a seasonal basis. Feeding competition, predation risk and
   reproductive competition can not fully explain these unusual aspects of
   lemur social organization. It has therefore been suggested that the
   social consequences of the risk of infanticide and of recent changes in
   activity may be ultimately responsible for these idiosyncracies of
   group-living lemurs, an explanation largely supported by the available
   evidence. Thus, social factors and fundamental life-history traits, in
   addition to ecological factors, contribute importantly to variation in
   social systems among lemurs, and possibly other primates. However,
   neither the diversity of lemur social systems, nor the evolutionary
   forces and mechanisms operating in these and other primates are yet
   fully understood.},

Booktitle = {COORDINATION IN HUMAN AND PRIMATE GROUPS},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {37-56},
Abstract = {Many animals are organised into social groups. Because individuals have
   different preferences and diverging needs, conflicts of interests exist;
   these conflicts are particularly revealed and negotiated in the context
   of group movements. Thus, group movements provide an excellent example
   to study coordination processes in non-human primates. In this chapter
   we review several aspects related to group movements in non-human
   primates. We first summarise the current understanding of variation in
   spacing patterns, types of leadership, and decision-making processes. We
   then focus on methodological issues and discuss various operational
   definitions of group movements, and we propose an operational definition
   that has already been applied successfully in studies of small
   free-ranging groups. We conclude by discussing the possibilities and
   limitations of transferring concepts and methods from studies of
   non-human primate groups to research on human groups.},

Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {66},
Number = {10},

Abstract = {Examining seasonal mortality patterns can yield insights into the
   drivers of mortality and thus potential selection pressures acting on
   individuals in different environments. We compiled adult and juvenile
   mortality data from nine wild non-human primate taxa to investigate the
   role of seasonality in patterns of mortality and address the following
   questions: Is mortality highly seasonal across species? Does greater
   environmental seasonality lead to more seasonal mortality patterns? If
   mortality is seasonal, is it higher during wet seasons or during periods
   of food scarcity? and Do folivores show less seasonal mortality than
   frugivores? We found seasonal mortality patterns in five of nine taxa,
   and mortality was more often tied to wet seasons than food-scarce
   periods, a relationship that may be driven by disease. Controlling for
   phylogeny, we found a positive relationship between the degree of
   environmental seasonality and mortality, with folivores exhibiting more
   seasonal mortality than frugivores. These results suggest that mortality
   patterns are influenced both by diet and degree of environmental
   seasonality. Applied to a wider array of taxa, analyses of seasonal
   mortality patterns may aid understanding of life-history evolution and
   selection pressures acting across a broad spectrum of environments and
   spatial and temporal scales.},

Volume = {78},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Ruffed lemurs (genus Varecia) are often described as having a flexible
   social organization, such that both cohesive (low fission-fusion
   dynamics) and fluid (high fission-fusion dynamics) grouping patterns
   have been observed. In ruffed lemur communities with high fission-fusion
   dynamics, group members vary in their temporal and spatial dispersion
   throughout a communally defended territory. These patterns have been
   likened to those observed in several haplorrhine species that exhibit
   the most fluid types of fission-fusion social organization (e. g., Pan
   and Ateles). To substantiate and further refine these claims, we
   describe the fission-fusion dynamics of a black-and-white ruffed lemur
   (Varecia variegata) community at Mangevo, an undisturbed primary
   rainforest site in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. We collected
   instantaneous group scan samples from August 2007-December 2008 (4,044
   observation hours) to study and characterize patterns of subgroup size,
   composition, cohesion, and social association. In 16 consecutive months,
   we never found all members of the community together. In fact,
   individuals spent nearly half of their time alone. Subgroups were small,
   cohesive, and typically of mixed-sex composition. Mixed-sex subgroups
   were significantly larger, less cohesive, and more common than either
   male-only or female-only subgroups. Subgroup dynamics were related to
   shifts in climate, phenology of preferred fruit species, and female
   reproductive state. Onaverage, association indices were low. Males and
   females were equally gregarious; however, adult male-male associations
   were significantly weaker than any other association type. Results
   presented herein document striking differences in fission-fusion
   dynamics between black-and-white ruffed lemurs and haplorrhines, while
   also demonstrating many broad-scale similarities to haplorrhine taxa
   that possess the most fluid fission-fusion societies. (C) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {Eulemur fulvus rufus has been described as having stable
   multi-male/multi-female groups, a male-biased sex ratio, and female
   philopatry. However, in a 16-year study of this subspecies we documented
   a great deal of demographic change as several groups permanently
   fissioned, some groups disappeared, and new groups formed. We split the
   dataset into two periods, 1988 to 1993 and 1994 to 2003, which coincided
   with the first disappearance of a study group (in August 1994) and the
   first permanent group fission (in December 1994). The average group size
   decreased by nearly half between the study periods (10.5-5.6), while the
   frequency of group membership changes increased (2.0-8.3 times/year),
   and the birth rate decreased (0.56-0.38). Females, as well as males,
   immigrated into study groups and transferred between groups, something
   that has been rarely seen in this subspecies. We also found a
   significant decline in the amount of fruit from the earliest part of the
   study to the latter part of the study. Study groups did not switch to
   other types of foods during periods of fruit shortage, but traveled
   outside of their home range areas more often over the study period.
   Finally, the density E. f rufus decreased in the study area while the
   densities of their main food competitors, Varecia variegata and Eulemur
   rubriventer, increased. Although few primate populations are numerically
   stable over time, we suggest that female behavioral responses to
   decreases in fruit availability may have influenced some of the
   demographic changes we witnessed in this study.},

   The Effects of Female Behavior and Ejaculation},

Abstract = {In this study, dominance rank instability among male Lemur catta during
   mating was investigated. Also, data on agonism and sexual behavior
   across five consecutive mating seasons in a population of L. catta on
   St. Catherines Island, USA, were collected. Instances of male rank
   instability were categorized into three types. Type I consisted of a
   temporary switch in the dominance ranks of two males, which lasted for a
   per riod of minutes or hours. Type 2 dyadic male agonistic interactions
   showed highly variable outcomes for a period of time during which wins
   and losses were neither predictable nor consistent. Type 3 interactions
   consisted of a single agonistic win by a lower-ranked male over a more
   dominant male. More Type 2 interactions (indicating greater dominance
   instability) occurred when males had not spent the previous mating
   season in the same group, but this trend was not statistically
   significant. The majority of periods of male rank instability were
   preceded by female proceptivity or receptivity directed to a
   lower-ranked male. As such, exhibition of female mate choice for a
   lower-ranking male appeared to incite male-male competition. Following
   receipt of female proceptivity or receptivity, males who were
   lower-ranking took significantly longer to achieve their first agonistic
   win over a more dominant male than did males who were higher-ranked.
   Ejaculation frequently preceded loss of dominance. In conclusion,
   temporary rank reversals and overall dominance rank instability commonly
   occur among male L. catta in mating contexts, and these temporary
   increases in dominance status appear to positively affect male mating
   success. Am J Phys Anthropol 138:293-305, 2009. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {A new method of scoring dental microscopic use wear, initially developed
   for and applied to extant and extinct ungulates, is here applied to
   primates, and the efficacy of the method as a tool for diagnosing diet
   in both ungulates and primates is established. The method employs
   standard refractive light microscopy instead of scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), and all use-wear features are counted or scored under
   low magnification (35X). We use measurement systems analysis (variance
   components analysis of sources of measurement error) to evaluate the
   consistency and reproducibility of measurements using this method. The
   method is shown to have low intra- and inter-observer measurement error,
   and to effectively distinguish among graminivores, folivores, and
   frugivores. It can also be used to identify seed predators and to
   diagnose hard-object feeding. The method is also shown to be robust to
   the selection of measurement site; it works equally well when applied to
   upper or to lower molars. Finally, we use analysis of variance to
   examine the consistency of the signals across mammalian orders, and
   discriminant function analysis to develop dietary diagnostic tools for a
   set of ``classified{''} primates with known diets. We test the success
   of these tools not merely by examining their a posteriori classification
   ``success,{''} but by using them to construct predicted dietary profiles
   for a sample of unclassified extant primate species, again with known
   diets. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Reproductive skew in female-dominated mammalian societies},
Booktitle = {REPRODUCTIVE SKEW IN VERTEBRATES: PROXIMATE AND ULTIMATE CAUSES},
Year = {2009},
Pages = {53-83},
Abstract = {We review available data documenting reproductive skew in the small
   group of mammals characterized by female dominance over males, focusing
   mainly on lemurs and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta). Although most
   females in all lemur species examined here appear to bear young at each
   opportunity, we know very little about variation in longer-term
   reproductive success or rates of reproduction among female lemurs.
   Therefore we cannot draw firm conclusions in regard to reproductive skew
   among female lemurs except that at present this appears to be slight.
   However, current data show that female lemurs typically mate with
   multiple males, and that a substantial fraction of litters containing
   multiple offspring is sired by more than one male. The extent of
   reproductive skew in male lemurs varies among species, but there is a
   slight trend, among the lemur species for which genetic data exist, for
   male skew to decrease as the intensity of female dominance increases.
   Variance in reproductive success among female spotted hyenas appears to
   be substantially greater than it is in male-dominated species in which
   plural breeding occurs. In this species, female dominance, combined with
   virilization of the external genitalia, may increase female control over
   mating to its extreme limit, such that we find very little reproductive
   skew among males relative to that found in other polygynous mammals. The
   most dominant male hyenas often achieve very little reproductive
   success. Overall, reproductive skew among females in female-dominated
   mammals appears to be the same as or slightly greater than that in
   male-dominated species, whereas skew among males in female-dominated
   species generally tends to be relatively low.},

   Baseline},
Booktitle = {MIND THE GAP: TRACING THE ORIGINS OF HUMAN UNIVERSALS},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {395-426},
Abstract = {Social behavior, culture, and cognition are domains where presumably
   most human universals exist. Identification of these derived human
   traits depends and relies on comparisons with other primates, notably
   chimpanzees. This approach can also be used to reconstruct primate and
   human behavioral evolution. Accordingly, traits found in both Homo and
   Pan can be inferred to have existed in their last common ancestor as
   well. By analogy, traits shared between humans and other primates can be
   traced back even further down on our family tree. Here, we look at the
   other side of human universals, i.e., behavioral and cognitive traits of
   the most basal living primates, which ought to represent the common
   primate legacy upon which later taxon-specific specializations were
   built. Specifically, we review studies investigating cognitive abilities
   and social behavior of the lemuriform primates of Madagascar. The
   Malagasy lemurs are particularly important for this purpose because they
   alone, among strepsirrhine primates, have evolved group-living, which
   characterizes most living haplorrhines. Even though lemurs have
   relatively smaller brains than New and Old World monkeys and great apes,
   their ability to solve problems that require technical intelligence is
   qualitatively on par with that of haplorrhines. In the domain of social
   intelligence, however, lemurs deviate from the better-known haplorrhine
   models (i.e., cercopithecines) in several respects. Most importantly,
   their behavioral strategies reflect an emphasis on within-group
   competition, rather than cooperation, which may represent lemur-specific
   adaptations to an ecologically unpredictable environment, rather than
   fundamental deficits in social intelligence. In any event, a broad
   comparative perspective including the best living models of the earliest
   gregarious primates can enrich reconstructions and other evolutionary
   analyzes of primate social behavior, including that of humans.},

Year = {1999},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {31-72},
Abstract = {The last decade's lemur research includes successes in discovering new
   living and extinct species and learning about the distribution,
   biogeography, physiology, behavior, and ecology of previously
   little-studied species. In addition, in both the dry forest and rain
   forest, long-term studies of lemur demography, life history and
   reproduction, have been completed in conjunction with data on tree
   productivity, phenology, and climate. Lemurs contrast with anthropoids
   in several behavioral features, including female dominance, targeted
   female-female aggression, lack of sexual dimorphism regardless of mating
   system, sperm competition coupled with male-male aggression, high infant
   mortality, cathemerality, and strict seasonal breeding. Hypotheses to
   explain these traits include the ``energy conservation hypothesis{''}
   (ECH) suggesting that harsh and unpredictable climate factors on the
   island of Madagascar have affected the evolution of female dominance,
   and the ``evolutionary disequilibrium hypotheses{''} (EVDH) suggesting
   that the recent megafauna extinctions have influenced lemurs to become
   diurnal. These hypotheses are compared and contrasted in light of recent
   empirical data on climate, subfossils, and lemur behavior. New data on
   life histories of the rain forest lemurs at Ranomafana National Park
   give further support to the ECH. Birth seasons are synchronized within
   each species, but there is a 6-month distribution of births among
   species. Gestation and lactation lengths vary among sympatric lemurs,
   but all lemur species in the rain forest wean in synchrony at the season
   most likely to have abundant resources. Across-species weaning synchrony
   seen in Ranomafana corroborates data from the dry forest that late
   lactation and weaning is the life history event that is the primary
   focus of the annual schedule. Lemur adaptations may assure maximum
   offspring survival in this environment with an unpredictable food supply
   and heavy predation. In conclusion, a more comprehensive energy
   frugality hypothesis (EFH) is proposed, which postulates that the
   majority of lemur traits are either adaptations to conserve energy
   (e.g., low basal metabolic rate (BMR), torpor, sperm competition, small
   group size, seasonal breeding) or to maximize use of scarce resources
   (e.g., cathemerality, territoriality, female dominance, fibrous diet,
   weaning synchrony). Among primates, the isolated adaptive radiation of
   lemurs on Madagascar may have been uniquely characterized by selection
   toward efficiency to cope with the harsh and unpredictable island
   environment. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
