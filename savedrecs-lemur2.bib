Abstract = {The ability to associate memorized objects with their location in space
   gradually declines during normal aging and can drastically be affected
   by neurodegenerative diseases. This study investigates object-location
   paired-associates learning (PAL) in the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus
   murinus), a nonhuman primate model of brain aging. Touchscreen-based
   testing of 6 young adults (1-5 years) and 6 old adults (>7 years) in the
   procedural rodent dPAL-task revealed significant age-related performance
   decline, evident in group differences in the percentage of correct
   decision during learning and the number of sessions needed to reach a
   predefined criterion. Response pattern analyses suggest decreased
   susceptibility to relative stimulus-position biases in young animals,
   facilitating PAL. Additional data from a subset of ``overtrained{''}
   individuals (n=7) and challenge sessions using a modified protocol
   (sPAL) further suggest that learning criteria routinely used in animal
   studies on PAL can underestimate the endpoint at which a stable
   performance is reached and that more conservative criteria are needed to
   improve construct validity of the task. To conclude, this is the first
   report of an age effect on dPAL and corroborates the role of mouse
   lemurs as valuable natural nonhuman primate models in aging research.},

Abstract = {This study was intended to examine the effect of a combination of
   different NaOH concentration treatments and drying methods on the in
   vitro total gas production. The materials used in this study were lemuru
   fish oil and the capsules were starch, caustic soda, CaCl2, and the
   chemicals for in vitro gas test analysis. This study applied a
   Completely Randomized Design (CRD) on 3x2 factorial and 3 replications.
   The parameters observed in the experiment included the total gas
   production. The data in this study were tested using an analysis of
   variance and continued with the Duncan test. The results of this study
   indicated that there is no interaction between the different NaOH
   concentrations and the drying method on the total gas production. Based
   on these results, it can be concluded that the difference in the NaOH
   levels in lemuru fish oil and the drying method has no effect on the
   rumen fermentation. The gas production from fractions a, b, and a + b in
   the sun drying method was significantly higher than on the oven drying
   method.},

Abstract = {We provide an anecdote of daytime activity within the northern giant
   mouse lemur (Mirza zaza), a small threatened primate that has always
   been considered strictly nocturnal, in the Anabohazo forest of
   northwestern Madagascar. During the dry season, we witnessed two
   individual M. zaza travelling separately in the afternoon period of
   three different days. Our observations indicate that M. zaza may
   undertake activity that is essential for their survival within both the
   light and dark periods of a day-cycle, and our findings suggest that the
   activity cycle of this species may be highly flexible. These
   observations have important implications to understand the evolution of
   activity patterns in M. zaza, and these findings warrant future, long
   term studies to establish the annual activity patterns of M. zaza and to
   determine whether this species is potentially cathemeral and why.},

Abstract = {This study has purpose to estimate the metabolic energy of protected
   lemuru fish oil using the rumen fermentation gas production analysis.
   This study applied a combination of treatments, which is differences in
   NaOH concentrations and drying methods on the total gas production in
   vitro. The gas production was determined at the incubation of 0, 2, 4,
   8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours. This study applied a Completely Randomized
   Design on 3x2 factorial. The parameters observed included the total gas
   production, the data were tested using an analysis of variance and
   continued with the Duncan test. The results of this study indicated that
   at the incubation time of 48 hours and 72 hours, there was no difference
   in the interaction between the NaOH concentration and the drying method
   on the total gas production, and there was a significant difference
   between the NaOH concentration and the drying method in terms of
   metabolizable energy (ME). The results of the highest ME value in the
   protected lemuru fish oil were 10\% NaOH concentration and the sun
   drying method was 4.56 MJ/ Kg BK, it can be concluded that the ME
   estimation is influenced by the yield of incubation gas production for
   24 hours.},

Title = {Mitochondrial DNA reveals genetically structured haplogroups of Bali
   sardinella (Sardinella lemuru) in Philippine waters},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Population genetic structure of Sardinella lemuru in Philippine waters
   was examined using mitochondrial DNA markers, control region (CR) and
   cytochrome oxidase I (COI). The sampling effort was focused along the
   northern coast of Mindanao where the species was previously reported to
   have regionally structured stocks. Sequences from online databases were
   included to expand geographic coverage of the analyses. Phylogeographic
   and population genetic inferences revealed the presence of genetically
   structured sympatric haplogroups across the archipelago (CR: n = 493, K
   = 3, between-group genetic distance = 0.038 - 0.054, global phi(ST) =
   0.41 p < 0.001; COI: n = 159, K = 2, between-group genetic distance =
   0.012, global phi(ST) = 0.77, p < 0.001). In contrast, little to no
   genetic differentiation was inferred when samples were assigned based on
   geographic location (CR global phi(ST) = 0.01, p 0.05; COI global
   phi(ST) = 0.001, p 0.05). These results suggest that (1) gene flow
   occurs across space, but is limited among sympatric haplogroups, (2)
   these sympatric haplogroups do not correspond to cryptic species, and
   (3) differences in mutation rates between the two markers may have led
   to a different number of haplogroups being recovered. High haplotype
   diversity (H-CR = 0.99; H-COI = 0.798), low nucleotide diversity (pi(CR)
   = 0.041; pi(COI) = 0.005), and significantly negative Fu's F-S values
   implied demographic expansion for all haplogroups. The mismatch
   distribution and Bayesian Skyline plot indicated that expansion occurred
   during the late Pleistocene. Based on our results, we hypothesize that
   the Philippines is a secondary contact zone for S. lemuru, and testing
   this requires that samples be obtained from the entire habitat range of
   the species along the Indo-West Pacific Region.

Title = {Population Estimates of Hubbard's Sportive Lemur (Lepilemur hubbardorum)

Volume = {92},

Abstract = {Estimates of population size are fundamental to setting conservation
   priorities for threatened primate species. Many taxa in the lemur genus
   Lepilemur remain understudied, and basic population statistics are often
   dated, incomplete, or absent. Hubbard's sportive lemur (Lepilemur
   hubbardorum) is known only from the Zombitse-Vohibasia National Park
   region in southwestern Madagascar. It is listed as Endangered by the
   IUCN owing to its fragmented, declining habitat and limited geographic
   range. However, this classification has not been confirmed through
   systematic population estimates. To address this issue, we undertook
   line transect surveys in the Zombitse parcel of the National Park. We
   applied geospatial analyses and data to quantify forest area as a proxy
   for L. hubbardorumhabitat. We recorded a total of 234 L. hubbardorum
   sightings over 18 survey nights, representing 47.2 km of survey effort.
   Our surveys revealed population densities of 145.6 L. hubbardorum
   individuals per km(2) (95\% CI: 97.2-218.1), for an extrapolated
   abundance estimate of ca. 16,500-18,000 L. hubbardorum individuals
   across the protected forests of the Zombitse parcel. This abundance
   estimate should be considered provisional, however, because our
   restricted sampling area did not include the more remote regions of the
   National Park where habitat disturbance and hunting practices have
   likely contributed to localized population declines.},

Title = {Litter sex composition influences competitive performance during first
   reproduction in male mouse lemurs},
Journal = {PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {228},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {In litter-bearing mammals, conditions experienced early in life can have
   long-lasting consequences on adult behavioral and physiological
   phenotypes, including reproductive fitness and survival. Using data from
   a large database, we focused our analysis on the consequences of litter
   composition on the reproductive performance of 131 mouse lemur males
   during their first breeding season. For male offspring, body mass at
   birth and at weaning only depended on the litter size (from one to 3),
   with the lowest values in triplets. Early growth had no relationship
   with the future reproductive success when males entered their first
   breeding season. When mouse lemurs were kept in groups with 2 or 3
   competitors, males entered sexual competition for priority access to
   females in estrus, leading to a hierarchy with the dominant male
   ensuring the successful mating of the females. Genetic paternity tests
   showed that males born in same-sex litters (M, MM, MMM) were more
   competitive and fathered more offspring than males born in mixed-sex
   litters (MF, MMF, MFF), indicating the negative impact of a sister on
   male reproductive success. However, testosterone levels were unrelated
   to early growth or litter sex composition but were dependent on social
   interactions during sexual competition, with higher values in successful
   males. The effects of litter composition on the mating success of male
   mouse lemurs might mainly occur through social interactions between male
   offspring born in same-sex litters. Play fighting between juvenile males
   could play a major role in their acquisition of the skills required to
   succeed in sexual competition.},

Abstract = {Digestive tract measurements are often considered species specific, but
   little information exists on the degree to which they change during

   debatable. In the present study, the macroscopic anatomy of the

   stomach and intestines) of 58 Lemur catta {[}ranging in age from 1 month
   (neonates) to 25 years], which had been stored frozen (n = 27) or fixed
   in formalin (n = 31), was quantified. Particular attention was paid to
   the caecum and the possible presence of an appendix. The intraspecific
   allometric scaling of body mass (BM)(0.46{[}0.40;0.51]) for total
   intestine length and BM0.48{[}0.41;0.54] for small intestine length was
   higher than the expected geometric scaling of BM0.33, and similar to
   that reported in the literature for interspecific scaling. This
   difference in scaling is usually explained by the hypothesis that, to
   maintain optimal absorption, the diameter of the intestinal tube cannot
   increase geometrically. Therefore, geometric volume gain of increasing
   body mass is accommodated for by more-than-geometric length scaling.
   According to the literature, not all L. catta have an appendix. No
   appendix was found in the specimens in the present study. The
   proportions of length measurements did not change markedly during
   ontogeny, indicating that the proportions of the foetus are
   representative of those of the adult animal. By contrast, width and
   tissue-mass scaling of the caecum indicated disproportionate growth of
   this organ during ontogeny that was not reflected in its length.
   Compared to overall intraspecific variation, the method of storage
   (frozen vs. formalin) had no relevant impact on length or weight
   measurements.},

Abstract = {Ranging behavior is one important strategy by which nonhuman primates
   obtain access to resources critical to their biological maintenance and
   reproductive success. As most primates live in permanent social groups,
   their members must balance the benefits of group living with the costs
   of intragroup competition for resources. However, some taxa live in more
   spatiotemporally flexible social groups, whose members modify patterns
   of association and range use as a method to mitigate these costs. Here,
   we describe the range use of one such taxon, the black-and-white ruffed
   lemur (Varecia variegata), at an undisturbed primary rain forest site in
   Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, and characterize sex differences
   in annual home range area, overlap, and daily distances traveled.
   Moreover, we characterize seasonal variability in range use and ask
   whether ranging behaviors can be explained by either climatic or
   reproductive seasonality. We found that females used significantly
   larger home ranges than males, though sexes shared equal and moderate
   levels of home range overlap. Overall, range use did not vary across
   seasons, although within sexes, male range use varied significantly with
   climate. Moreover, daily path length was best predicted by day length,
   female reproductive state, and sex, but was unrelated to climate
   variables. While the patterns of range use and spatial association
   presented here share some similarities with ``bisexually bonded{''}
   community models described for chimpanzees, we argue that ruffed lemurs
   best conform to a ``nuclear neighborhood{''} community model wherein
   nuclear (core) groups share the highest levels of home range overlap,
   and where these groups cluster spatially into adjacent
   ``neighborhoods{''} within the larger, communally defended territory.},

Title = {Long-term management of congestive heart failure secondary to mitral
   stenosis in a ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta)},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {257},

Abstract = {CASE DESCRIPTION
   A 15-year-old sexually intact female ring-tailed lemur ( Lemur catta)
   was evaluated for a heart murmur and progressive radiographic
   cardiomegaly.
   CLINICAL FINDINGS
   The lemur was clinically normal at the time of initial evaluation.
   Results of transthoracic echocardiography performed when the animal was
   anesthetized indicated mitral valve stenosis and severe left atrial
   dilation. Three months later, signs of left-sided congestive heart
   failure (CHF; coughing, exercise intolerance, and tachypnea) were
   observed and confirmed by the presence of radiographic pulmonary edema.
   TREATMENT AND OUTCOME
   Medical treatment that consisted of aspirin, benazepril, furosemide,
   pimobendan, spironolactone, and ultimately torsemide in lieu of
   furosemide successfully controlled the lemur's clinical signs for 33
   months after the development of CHF. Euthanasia was then elected on the
   basis of perceived poor quality of life because tachypnea became
   refractory to progressively higher dosages of diuretic. Necropsy
   confirmed mitral stenosis with severe left atrial dilation and chronic
   pulmonary congestion.
   CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   The present report described the long-term medical management of CHF
   secondary to mitral stenosis in a lemur. Mitral stenosis was suspected
   to be a congenital defect, similar to the cause of mitral stenosis
   reported for dogs and cats, rather than to be an acquired change in
   association with rheumatic heart disease as commonly occurs for people.
   The lemur's CHF was well managed for 33 months with treatment, including
   pimobendan, which was well tolerated.},

Title = {Brown Mouse Lemurs (Microcebus rufus) May Lack Opportunities to Learn

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},
Number = {5},
Pages = {452-462},

Abstract = {Diurnal primates commonly modify their behaviour in response to predator
   vocalizations, but little is known about how nocturnal primates perceive
   predator calls. Mouse lemurs do not innately perceive predator calls as
   dangerous but may learn to do so in the wild. I hypothesized that wild
   brown mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus) in Ranomafana National Park,
   Madagascar, differentiate between predator and non-predator
   vocalizations and exposed 29 adult subjects to calls of 3 sympatric
   predators (goshawk, fossa and owl), 3 sympatric non-predators and 4
   controls. Brown mouse lemurs did not differentiate among stimuli, and
   there was no evidence that any recording was associated with danger, as
   neither activity nor spatial preferences changed in response to a
   stimulus, nor did subjects exhibit obvious behaviours indicative of
   danger such as flight or position on the branches. The failure to
   perceive predator calls as dangerous is common among small nocturnal
   solitary prey species and could be explained by a lack of learning
   opportunities. In social species acquired behaviours can spread quickly
   by social learning. Solitary species like mouse lemurs have to
   individually learn to associate predator calls with danger which is
   dependent on encounter rates. Unlike diurnal prey mouse lemurs lack the
   opportunity to observe diurnal raptors and associate their calls with
   the bird, and owls are proficient predators, which are difficult to
   observe in a rain forest where they hunt cryptically from perches. While
   sometimes nocturnal, the fossa is solitary and largely silent, and is
   also particularly rare at my study site. Cryptic, rare or non-vocal
   predators provide prey with few opportunities to associate their calls
   with danger. Mouse lemurs are subject to high predation rates by a wide
   range of predators and need to balance the costs and benefits of
   antipredation behaviours. Their cryptic lifestyle and preference for
   dense vegetation lowers the likelihood of being detected by predators,
   and they utilize visual and olfactory predator cues to make decisions
   about risk. Furthermore, their high reproductive output compensates for
   the high predation rates.},

Abstract = {Predator odors such as urine and feces are known to elicit antipredator
   behaviors in prey including avoidance, fear, and curiosity. We measured
   how wild brown mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus) responded to odors of
   mammalian, avian, and snake predators as well as nonpredator controls.
   The first experiment took place under controlled conditions in a
   laboratory where we recorded the occurrence of four behavioral
   categories (ignore, curiosity, alert, and fear) in response to a single
   odor. Subjects exhibited behavioral change significantly more often in
   response to the predator than to control stimuli, but did not
   distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar predators. Mammalian
   predator urine and feces were most likely to elicit behavioral change.
   The owl was the only predator to never elicit behavioral change,
   possibly because owls do not provide relevant odor cues. A second
   experiment employing live traps in the forest found that neither
   predator nor control odors affected the likelihood of capture. Due to
   their longevity, odors do not provide accurate information of spatial
   and temporal risk, and while mouse lemurs may have initially hesitated
   to enter a trap, in the absence of additional information about risk,
   they may have eventually ignored the stimuli. This study found that
   brown mouse lemurs are able to distinguish between predator and
   nonpredator odors, and that risk assessment may be affected by the
   experience, as well as predator and sensory stimulus quality.},

Title = {Mid-Cenozoic climate change, extinction, and faunal turnover in
   Madagascar, and their bearing on the evolution of lemurs},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Background Was there a mid-Cenozoic vertebrate extinction and recovery
   event in Madagascar and, if so, what are its implications for the
   evolution of lemurs? The near lack of an early and mid-Cenozoic fossil
   record on Madagascar has inhibited direct testing of any such
   hypotheses. We compare the terrestrial vertebrate fauna of Madagascar in
   the Holocene to that of early Cenozoic continental Africa to shed light
   on the probability of a major mid-Cenozoic lemur extinction event,
   followed by an ``adaptive radiation{''} or recovery. We also use
   multiple analytic approaches to test competing models of lemur
   diversification and the null hypothesis that no unusual mid-Cenozoic
   extinction of lemurs occurred. Results Comparisons of the terrestrial
   vertebrate faunas of the early Cenozoic on continental Africa and
   Holocene on Madagascar support the inference that Madagascar suffered a
   major mid-Cenozoic extinction event. Evolutionary modeling offers some
   corroboration, although the level of support varies by phylogeny and
   model used. Using the lemur phylogeny and divergence dates generated by
   Kistler and colleagues, RPANDA and TESS offer moderate support for the
   occurrence of unusual extinction at or near the Eocene-Oligocene (E-O)
   boundary (34 Ma). TreePar, operating under the condition of obligate
   mass extinction, found peak diversification at 31 Ma, and low
   probability of survival of prior lineages. Extinction at the E-O
   boundary received greater support than other candidate extinctions or
   the null hypothesis of no major extinction. Using the lemur phylogeny
   and divergence dates generated by Herrera \& Davalos, evidence for
   large-scale extinction diminishes and its most likely timing shifts to
   before 40 Ma, which fails to conform to global expectations. Conclusions
   While support for large-scale mid-Cenozoic lemur extinction on
   Madagascar based on phylogenetic modeling is inconclusive, the African
   fossil record does provide indirect support. Furthermore, a major
   extinction and recovery of lemuriforms during the Eocene-Oligocene
   transition (EOT) would coincide with other major vertebrate extinctions
   in North America, Europe, and Africa. It would suggest that Madagascar's
   lemurs were impacted by the climate shift from ``greenhouse{''} to
   ``ice-house{''} conditions that occurred at that time. This could, in
   turn, help to explain some of the peculiar characteristics of the
   lemuriform clade.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary Excessive body mass, i.e., being overweight or obese, is
   a health concern. Some lemur species are prone to extreme weight gain in
   captivity, yet for others a healthy body condition is typical. The first
   aim of our study was to examine possible ecological explanations for
   these species' differences in susceptibility to captive weight gain
   across 13 lemur species. Our second aim was to explore demographic and
   environmental risk factors across individuals from the four best-sampled
   species. We found a potential ecological explanation for susceptibility
   to captive weight gain: being adapted to unpredictable wild food
   resources. Additionally, we also revealed one environmental and four
   demographic risk factors, e.g., increasing age and, for males, being
   housed with only fixed climbing structures. Our results indicate
   targeted practical ways to help address weight issues in affected
   animals, e.g., by highlighting at-risk species for whom extra care
   should be taken when designing diets; and by providing a mixture of
   flexible and fixed climbing structures within enclosures. Excessive body
   mass, i.e., being overweight or obese, is a health concern associated
   with issues such as reduced fertility and lifespan. Some lemur species
   are prone to extreme weight gain in captivity, yet others are not. To
   better understand species- and individual-level effects on
   susceptibility to captive weight gain, we use two complementary methods:
   phylogenetic comparative methods to examine ecological explanations for
   susceptibility to weight gain across species, and epidemiological
   approaches to examine demographic and environment effects within
   species. Data on body masses and living conditions were collected using
   a survey, yielding useable data on 675 lemurs representing 13 species
   from 96 collections worldwide. Data on species-typical wild ecology for
   comparative analyses came from published literature and climate
   databases. We uncovered one potential ecological risk factor: species
   adapted to greater wild food resource unpredictability tended to be more
   prone to weight gain. Our epidemiological analyses on the four
   best-sampled species revealed four demographic and one environmental
   risk factors, e.g., for males, being housed with only fixed climbing
   structures. We make practical recommendations to help address weight
   concerns, and describe future research including ways to validate the
   proxy we used to infer body condition.},

Abstract = {Invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystem
   function. Thus, understanding their spread and ecological impacts is
   critical for management and control. Strawberry guava (Psidium
   cattleianumSabine) is an aggressive invader across the tropics and has
   been rapidly spreading throughout the eastern rainforests of Madagascar.
   However, both the mechanisms of its spread on the island and the
   consequences of its invasion on native floral and faunal communities
   remain largely unexplored. By surveying multiple sites across
   Madagascar's eastern rainforests, we demonstrate that the introduction
   ofP. cattleianumsignificantly correlates with changes in forest
   structure-namely tree/shrub size, taxonomic richness, and taxonomic
   diversity. Further, at a local scale, the presence ofP. cattleianumwas
   associated with an increase in frugivore species richness; its primary
   dispersers during our study period were lemurs. Moreover, we identified
   species-specific effects of lemur gut-passage on the germination ofP.
   cattleianumseeds. Finally, microsatellite analysis ofP. cattleianumfrom
   a variety of locations across Madagascar demonstrated three distinct,
   highly differentiated, genetic population clusters, each with high
   levels of intra-population diversity, suggesting multiple independent
   introductions ofP. cattleianuminto Madagascar followed by long-distance
   dispersal. Collectively, these findings illuminate the complex status of
   strawberry guava invasion in Madagascar, which poses a growing threat to
   the island's unique flora and yet provides important forage for
   threatened and charismatic animal species.},

Abstract = {Among rodents, information about the external world is mainly acquired
   via the olfactory system, which is one of five sensory modalities.
   Several semiochemical signals are used for inter- and intraspecies
   communication {[}1]. In contrast, primates are generally regarded as
   vision-oriented mammals, and have been thought to trade their olfactory
   sensitivity for good sight. However, strepsirrhines have a
   well-developed olfactory system {[}2] and a larger repertoire of
   functional olfactory and vomeronasal receptor genes than haplorhines
   {[}3, 4]. Moreover, strepsirrhines are well known for their use of
   olfactory communication in social behavior. Ring-tailed lemurs are a
   species of Malagasy strepsirrhines, and use olfactory cues for
   conspecific communication. Male lemurs mark their scent by spreading
   volatiles from the antebrachial gland on their wrists. This study
   combined ethological and chemical approaches to identify a key
   odorant(s) in antebrachial secretions involved in the sexual
   communication of lemurs. The results of a behavioral assay indicated
   that females sniff the males' antebrachial secretions longer during the
   breeding season than during the nonbreeding season. By examining
   seasonal changes in volatiles using gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry, we found that the secretion of three C12 and C14 aldehydes
   with a fruity and floral scent significantly increased during the
   breeding season in a testosterone-dependent manner. Females sniffed for
   longer at biologically relevant concentrations of two of the aldehydes
   (12-methyltridecanal and tetradecanal) and were attracted to a mixture
   of these plus the third aldehyde, dodecanal. Our results suggest that
   these aldehydes are putative lemur pheromones involved in the
   attractiveness of males to females during the breeding season.},

Title = {Genetic relatedness cannot explain social preferences in black-and-white
   ruffed lemurs, Varecia variegata},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {164},
Pages = {73-82},

Abstract = {Fission-fusion social dynamics are common among a number of vertebrate
   taxa, and yet the factors shaping these variable associations among
   subgroup members have not been widely addressed. Associations may occur
   simply because of shared habitat preferences; however, social ties may
   also be influenced by genetic relatedness (kinship) or social
   attraction. Here, we investigate the association patterns of wild
   black-and-white ruffed lemurs, Varecia variegata, in Ranomafana National
   Park, Madagascar using behavioural, spatial (home range) and genetic
   data from 24 individually identified animals. We collected 40 840
   records of group composition over a 17-month period and from this
   calculated pairwise association indices. We also used ranging
   coordinates and genetic samples to estimate patterns of spatial overlap
   and kinship, and then related these measures to patterns of affiliation.
   From these analyses, we found that dyadic ruffed lemur social
   associations were generally sparse and weak, that home range overlap was
   minimal and that average relatedness within the community was low. We
   found no evidence that kinship was related to patterns of either spatial
   overlap or social association; instead, associations were primarily
   driven by space use. Moreover, social preferences were unrelated to
   kinship. While home range overlap explained most of the variation seen
   in social association, some variation remained unaccounted for,
   suggesting that other social, ecological and biological factors such as
   shared resource defence or communal breeding might also play a role in
   social attraction. Our results further highlight the need to consider
   individual space use and nuances of species behaviour when investigating
   social preference and social association more generally. (c) 2020 The

   comparisons difficult. The aim of this study was to examine differences
   in the strength and direction of lateralization in multiple lemur
   species when engaged in a standardized, novel cognitive task.
   Materials and Methods We assessed laterality in seven lemur species at
   the Duke Lemur Center when using a novel puzzle-box. We recorded which
   hand opened the apparatus door and which hand picked up the food reward.
   We also recorded whether the mouth was used for either action instead of
   the hands. We then calculated handedness indices (HI), z-scores, and
   mouth-use rates.
   Results Overall, 62\% of individuals were more lateralized than chance.
   However, within-genera, there were relatively equal numbers of
   individuals with a left- or right-hand bias, which resulted in
   ambipreference at the genus level. The hand a lemur used on its first
   success in the task predicted its overall HI value, and the strength of
   lateralization increased as the number of successes increased. Varecia
   had significantly higher mouth-use rates than all other genera.
   Discussion We found evidence of an individual learning trajectory in
   which the hand used on a lemur's first success was canalized as the
   preferred (and lateralized) hand, in support of the ``cognitive
   simplicity{''} hypothesis. Individual variability in hand preference was
   high, which is consistent with previous research. Between-genera
   differences in mouth use appear to reflect species-specific feeding
   postures and differences in manual dexterity.},

Abstract = {Although studies have sought to characterize variation in forearm
   muscular anatomy across the primate order, none have attempted to
   quantify ontogenetic changes in forearm myology within a single taxon.
   Herein, we present muscle architecture data for the forearm musculature
   (flexors and extensors of the wrist and digits) of Microcebus murinus, a
   small Lemuroid that has been the focus of several developmental studies.
   A quadratic curvilinear model described ontogenetic changes in muscle
   mass and fascicle length; however, fascicle lengths reached peak levels
   at an earlier age and showed a stronger decline during senescence.
   Conversely, physiological cross-sectional area followed a more linear
   trend, increasing steadily throughout life. As previous studies into the
   functional role of the primate forelimb emphasize the importance of long
   muscle fascicles within arboreal taxa in order to maximize mobility and
   flexibility, the early attainment of peak fascicle lengths may
   consequently reflect the importance of agility within this mobile and
   highly arboreal species. Similarly, observed myological trends in
   forearm strength are supported by previous in vivo data on grip strength
   within M. murinus in which senescent individuals showed no decline in
   forearm force relative to prime age individuals. This trend is
   interpreted to reflect compensation for the previously reported decline
   in hind limb grip strength in the hind limb with age, such that older
   individuals are able to maintain arboreal stability. Interestingly, the
   ontogenetic trajectory of each architectural variable mirrored previous
   observations of the masticatory musculature in M. murinus, suggesting
   that ontogenetic trends are relatively conserved between anatomical
   regions. Anat Rec, 303:1354-1363, 2020. (c) 2019 American Association

Title = {Ontogeny of locomotion in mouse lemurs: Implications for primate
   evolution},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {142},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The environment of juvenile primates is very challenging. They have to
   forage and move on the same substrates as adults do and escape the same
   predators, despite their immature state. In this study, we explore the
   developmental strategies that may provide effective locomotor abilities
   early in life. This could provide new insights into the selective
   pressures acting on juvenile primates and into evolution of primate
   locomotion. We conducted an ontogenetic study of 36 arboreal gray mouse
   lemurs from birth to adulthood (6 months of age). The investigated
   parameters were, for both limbs, (1) grasping behavior during locomotion
   (i.e., grip postures), (2) grasping performance (i.e., pull strength),
   and (3) motor coordination (i.e., rotarod test). Our results show that
   8-day-old babies are able to climb substrates of various slopes and
   diameters outside of their nest. Although juveniles cannot successfully
   complete a motor coordination test before 30 days of age, young
   individuals display relative pull strengths that are very high or even
   on par with adults, guaranteeing stability on narrow substrates. These
   powerful grasps highlight the importance of the grasping function for
   these juveniles that are not carried and move independently on arboreal
   substrates shortly after their first week of life. Moreover, the pedal
   grasping provides a secure grasp on all substrates across ontogeny;
   however, manual secure grasps decrease during development, being highly
   used only shortly after birth on vertical and narrow substrates. These
   results first suggest different functional roles of the hands and feet,
   with the hind limbs ensuring body balance on the substrates, freeing the
   upper limbs for manipulation. They further show vertical and narrow
   branches to be especially challenging, requiring strong grasps, which
   suggests that they may drive the evolution of strong grasping abilities
   in primates. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Life in a fragment: Evolution of foraging strategies of translocated

Abstract = {While the drivers of primate persistence in forest fragments have been
   often considered at the population level, the strategies to persist in
   these habitats have been little investigated at the individual or group
   level. Considering the rapid variation of fragment characteristics over
   time, longitudinal data on primates living in fragmented habitats are
   necessary to understand the key elements for their persistence. Since
   translocated animals have to cope with unfamiliar areas and face unknown
   fluctuations in food abundance, they offer the opportunity to study the
   factors contributing to successful migration between fragments. Here, we
   illustrated the evolution of the foraging strategies of translocated
   collared brown lemurs (Eulemur collaris) over an 18-year period in the
   Mandena Conservation Zone, south-east Madagascar. Our aim was to explore
   the ability of these frugivorous lemurs to adjust to recently colonized
   fragmented forests. Although the lemurs remained mainly frugivorous
   throughout the study period, over the years we identified a reduction in
   the consumption of leaves and exotic/pioneer plant species. These
   adjustments were expected in frugivorous primates living in a degraded
   area, but we hypothesize that they may also reflect the initial need to
   cope with an unfamiliar environment after the translocation. Since
   fragmentation is often associated with the loss of large trees and
   native vegetation, we suggest that the availability of exotic and/or
   pioneer plant species can provide an easy-to-access, nonseasonal food
   resource and be a key factor for persistence during the initial stage of
   the recolonization.},

Abstract = {The most common disease-causing mutation in the Cystic Fibrosis
   Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene, F508del, leads to
   cystic fibrosis (CF), by arresting CFTR processing and trafficking to
   the plasma membrane. The FDA-approved modulators partially restore CFTR
   function and slow down the progression of CF lung disease by increasing
   processing and delivery to the plasma membrane and improving activity of
   F508del-CFTR Cl- channels. However, the modulators do not correct
   compromised membrane stability of rescued F508del-CFTR. Transforming
   growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 is a well-established gene modifier of CF
   associated with worse lung disease in F508del-homozygous patients, by
   inhibiting CFTR biogenesis and blocking the functional rescue of
   F508del-CFTR. Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) is a transmembrane protein
   localized at the apical and basolateral membrane domain of human
   bronchial epithelial cells. Phosphorylation of the apical membrane CFTR
   by LMTK2 triggers its endocytosis and reduces the abundance of
   membrane-associated CFTR, impairing the CFTR-mediated Cl- transport. We
   have previously shown that LMTK2 knockdown improves the
   pharmacologically rescued F508del-CFTR abundance and function. Thus,
   reducing the LMTK2 recruitment to the plasma membrane may provide a
   useful strategy to potentiate the pharmacological rescue of
   F508del-CFTR. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of LMTK2 recruitment to
   the apical plasma membrane in polarized CFBE41o- cells. TGF-beta 1
   increased LMTK2 abundance selectively at the apical membrane by
   accelerating its recycling in Rab11-positive vesicles without affecting
   LMTK2 mRNA levels, protein biosynthesis, or endocytosis. Our data
   suggest that controlling TGF-beta 1 signaling may attenuate recruitment
   of LMTK2 to the apical membrane thereby improving stability of
   pharmacologically rescued F508del-CFTR.},

Abstract = {With the predicted increase in extreme weather events as a result of
   global climate change, animals living in dry or seasonally dry habitats
   are likely to experience dramatic fluctuations in water availability
   from season to season and year to year. Understanding how animals
   respond to short-term changes in water availability is paramount for
   future conservation and management of water-dependent wild populations.
   We investigated how short-term changes to the availability of water
   influenced habitat use of four groups of red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur
   rufifrons) in a dry deciduous forest in western Madagascar using
   detailed spatial data collected from GPS collars over 15 weeks. We
   experimentally manipulated water availability in the habitat and
   compared ranging patterns of the lemurs during the experiments to those
   before and after the experiments. Lemur groups shifted the intensity of
   their habitat use relative to changes in natural and experimental water
   availability. Specifically, lemurs were more likely to spend time in
   areas near experimental water sources during the experiment than in the
   same areas without water. Lemurs were less likely to spend time near
   previous habitual water sources when experimental water sources were
   available. We observed shifts in ranging intensity in response to
   natural changes to water availability when waterholes disappeared across
   the dry season. Our findings support the importance of water for shaping
   wild animal ranging patterns. We propose that water should be a primary
   consideration in future studies of habitat use, especially given the
   potential for climate change and human land use to further alter water
   availability for wild animals.},

Abstract = {Functional studies of skeletal anatomy are predicated on the fundamental
   assumption that form will follow function. For instance, previous
   studies have shown that the femora of specialized leaping primates are
   more robust than those of more generalized primate quadrupeds. Are such
   differences solely a plastic response to differential loading patterns
   during postnatal life, or might they also reflect more canalized
   developmental mechanisms present at birth? Here, we show that perinatal
   Lemur catta, an arboreal/terrestrial quadruped, have less robust femora
   than perinatal Propithecus coquereli, a closely related species
   specialized for vertical clinging and leaping (a highly unusual
   locomotor mode in which the hindlimbs are used to launch the animal
   between vertical tree trunks). These results suggest that functional
   differences in long bone cross-sectional dimensions are manifest at
   birth, belying simple interpretations of adult postcranial form as a
   direct record of loading patterns during postnatal life. Despite these
   significant differences in bone robusticity, we find that hindlimb bone
   mineralization, material properties, and measures of whole-bone strength
   generally overlap in perinatal L. catta and P. coquereli, indicating
   little differentiation in postcranial maturity at birth despite known
   differences in the pace of craniodental development between the species.
   In a broader perspective, our results likely reflect evolution acting
   during prenatal ontogeny. Even though primates are notable for
   relatively prolonged gestation and postnatal parental care, neonates are
   not buffered from selection, perhaps especially in the unpredictable and
   volatile environment of Madagascar. Anat Rec, 2018. (c) 2018 Wiley

Title = {Overexpression of lemur tyrosine kinase-2 protects neurons from

Abstract = {Lemur tyrosine kinase-2 (LMTK2), a newly identified serine/threonine
   kinase, is a potential regulator of cell survival and apoptosis.
   However, little is known about its role in regulating neuronal survival
   during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. The present study aimed to
   explore the potential function of LMTK2 in regulating neuronal survival
   using an in vitro model of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation
   (OGD/R)-induced injury. Herein, we found that LMTK2 expression was
   markedly decreased in neurons following OGD/R exposure. Gain-of-function
   experiments demonstrated that LMTK2 overexpression significantly
   improved the viability and reduced apoptosis of neurons with
   OGD/R-induced injury. Moreover, LMTK2 overexpression reduced the
   production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in OGD/R-exposed neurons.
   Notably, our results elucidated that LMTK2 overexpression reinforced the
   activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
   (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) antioxidant signaling
   associated with increased glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta)
   phosphorylation. GSK-3 beta inhibition by its specific inhibitor
   significantly reversed LMTK2-inhibition-linked apoptosis and ROS
   production. Additionally, silencing Nrf2 partially reversed the
   LMTK2-overexpression-mediated neuroprotective effect in OGD/R-injured
   neurons. Taken together, our results demonstrated that LMTK2
   overexpression alleviated OGD/R-induced neuronal apoptosis and oxidative
   damage by enhancing Nrf2/ARE antioxidant signaling via modulation of
   GSK-3 beta phosphorylation. Our study suggests LMTK2 is a potential
   target for neuroprotection during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. (C)

Title = {Female Power: A New Framework for Understanding ``Female Dominance{''}
   in Lemurs},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Female dominance is often associated with lemurs. However, consensus
   does not exist among primatologists on how to define, measure, or
   explain female dominance. This review explores the utility of applying a
   broader concept of power to understanding lemur intersexual
   relationships. In this framework, power is defined as arising from an
   asymmetry in a dyadic relationship and can be divided into 2 types:
   dominance and leverage. Intersexual asymmetries based upon females
   having superior fighting ability are considered female dominance.
   However, economic power also exists, and females with resource-based
   power exhibit female leverage. Additionally, power has 4 characteristics
   (base, means, amount, and scope) that describe the precise nature of
   observed phenomena. This article utilizes the 4 characteristics outlined
   in the power framework to review the existing ``female dominance{''}
   literature for lemurs and highlights the value of adopting both an
   expanded concept of power and a more precise language. By placing the
   multiple phenomena currently labeled under the single term ``female
   dominance{''} within the power framework, much of the confusion
   disappears. Thus, not only is the debate reframed, facilitating
   endeavors to find evolutionary explanations, but the uniqueness of
   female power in lemurs can be determined empirically rather than by
   definition.},

Abstract = {Lemuru fish oil (LFO) can be used as an energy source in poultry diet
   which contains unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids are
   easily oxidized thus require protection. Vitamin E and Selenium (Se) are
   antioxidants that can protect fatty acids from oxidation. This study
   aimed to evaluate blood metabolites and blood profiles of broiler fed
   ration containing LFO with the supplementation of antioxidants in form
   of different levels of vitamin E and Se. The study used 180 broiler
   chickens (Lohman MB 202) with 50:50 ratio of male and female reared for
   35 days. Randomized factorial design with two factors and three
   replications were used in this study, as for the first factor is two
   levels of vitamin E (0 mg kg(-1) and 200 mg kg(-1)) and the second
   factor is three levels of Se (0 mg kg(-1), 0.3 mg kg(-1) 0.6 mg kg(-1)).
   The results showed the use of 200 mg kg(-1) of vitamin E showed the
   increment of the blood hemoglobin, while the use of 0.6 mg kg(-1) Se
   decreased the number of lymphocytes and the combination both vitamin E
   and Se did not show any significant effect on the performance as well as
   the blood metabolites and blood profiles. The use of vitamin E 200 mg
   kg(-1) and Se 0.3 mg kg(-1) showed a lower H/L ratio compared to the
   other treatments, but there was no interaction between the two
   treatments. The supplementation of vitamin E 200 mg kg(-1) shows the
   best results in maintaining the health of broilers based on blood
   profile results.},

Abstract = {The non-invasive assessment of adrenocortical activity by measuring
   faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) in faeces is currently a widely
   used method, especially in exotic animals. The aim of our study was to
   biologically validate the suitability of six different enzyme
   immunoassays (EIAs) to quantify changes in FGM concentrations after a
   known strong stress stimulus (capture, sedation, blood collection for
   serological examination and tuberculination) in ring-tailed lemurs
   (Lemur cotta). Faecal samples were collected from six animals (four
   males and two females) twice daily spanning from two days before until
   three days after the exposure to the stress stimulus. The faecal samples
   obtained were extracted and the supernatants were measured for
   immunoreactive FGM concentrations using six different EIAs, namely
   cortisol, corticosterone, 11-oxoaetiocholanolone 1,
   11-oxoaetiocholanolone II, 11 beta-hydroxyaetiocholanolone and
   5a-pregnane-3 beta,11 beta,21-triol-20-one EIA. The baseline levels,
   peak levels (absolute concentration and percentage increase), the
   duration of the peak and lag time of the peak were calculated and
   statistically evaluated. The FGM concentrations started to increase on
   average 23 hours after the exposure to the stress stimulus and returned
   to pre-stress levels on average within 36 hours. Our results suggest
   that the two group-specific 11-oxoaetiocholanolone EIAs and the 11
   beta-hydroxyaetiocholanolone assay are generally suitable for the
   monitoring of stress response in ring-tailed lemurs.},

Title = {Genetic and morphological diversity of mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) in
   northern Madagascar: The discovery of a putative new species?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Abstract = {Tropical forests harbor extremely high levels of biological diversity
   and are quickly disappearing. Despite the increasingly recognized high
   rate of habitat loss, it is expected that new species will be discovered
   as more effort is put to document tropical biodiversity. Exploring
   under-studied regions is particularly urgent if we consider the rapid
   changes in habitat due to anthropogenic activities. Madagascar is known
   for its extraordinary biological diversity and endemicity. It is also
   threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. It holds more than 100
   endemic primate species (lemurs). Among these, Microcebus (mouse lemurs)
   is one of the more diverse genera. We sampled mouse lemurs from several
   sites across northern Madagascar, including forests never sampled
   before. We obtained morphological data from 99 Microcebus individuals;
   we extracted DNA from tissue samples of 42 individuals and amplified two
   mitochondrial loci (cytb and cox2) commonly used for species
   identification. Our findings update the distribution of three species
   (Microcebus tavaratra, Microcebus arnholdi, and Microcebus mamiratra),
   including a major increase in the distribution area of M. arnholdi. We
   also report the discovery of a new Microcebus lineage genetically
   related to M. arnholdi. Several complementary approaches suggest that
   the newly identified Microcebus lineage might correspond to a new
   putative species, to be confirmed or rejected with additional data. In
   addition, morphological analyses showed (a) clear phenotypic differences
   between M. tavaratra and M. arnholdi, but no clear differences between
   the new Microcebus lineage and the sister species M. arnholdi; and (b) a
   significant correlation between climatic variables and morphology,
   suggesting a possible relationship between species identity, morphology,
   and environment. By integrating morphological, climatic, genetic, and
   spatial data of two northern Microcebus species, we show that the
   spatial distribution of forest-dwelling species may be used as a proxy
   to reconstruct the past spatial changes in forest cover and vegetation
   type.},

Abstract = {Effective, targeted management and conservation plans for wildlife
   populations require reliable population sampling and estimation.
   Unfortunately, robust, comprehensive primate population estimates are
   often lacking, particularly for rare, elusive species. Historically,
   population estimates of primates have relied on labor-intensive
   line-transect sampling and distance estimation techniques. We used
   occupancy sampling to estimate the probability of occupancy and
   detection of seven lemur species in Ranomafana National Park,
   Madagascar, and explore relationships between occupancy and detection
   and landscape, habitat, and co-occurring species variables. We detected
   and provide estimates of occupancy and/or detection for seven lemur
   species in a World Heritage Site: Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar.
   We found habitat type was an important variable explaining occupancy
   patterns for detection of golden bamboo lemur (Hapalemur aureus), as
   well as red bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) and black-and-white
   ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata). The presence of free-ranging dogs
   (Canis familiaris) was an important factor in several competing models
   for red-bellied lemurs and eastern lesser bamboo lemurs (Hapalemur
   griseus), highlighting the threat posed by this exotic predator to
   primates. While some estimates had error values overlapping zero,
   reflecting the rarity and low detection of these species, these results
   indicate the importance of protecting multiple forest types to maintain
   lemur biodiversity and the underappreciated conservation threat of
   invasive species in Madagascar.},

Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neocortical Lewy body disease (LBD) are the
   most common neurodegenerative dementias, with no available curative
   treatment. Elucidating pathomechanism and identifying novel therapeutic
   targets are of paramount importance. Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) is
   involved in several physiological and pathological cellular processes.
   Herewith a neuropathological characterization is presented in AD and
   neocortical LBD samples using chromogenic and fluorescent LMTK2
   immunohistochemistry on post-mortem brain tissues and compared them to
   age-matched controls (CNTs). LMTK2 immunopositivity was limited to the
   neuronal cytoplasm. Neurons, including tau-positive tangle-bearing ones,
   showed decreased chromogenic and immunofluorescent labelling in AD in
   every cortical layer compared to CNT and neocortical LBD. Digital image
   analysis was performed to measure the average immunopositivity of
   groups. Mean grey values were calculated for each group after measuring
   the grey scale LMTK2 signal intensity of each individual neuron. There
   was significant difference between the mean grey values of CNT vs. AD
   and neocortical LBD vs. AD. The moderate decrease in neocortical LBD
   suggests the effect of coexisting AD pathology. We provide
   neuropathological evidence on decreased neuronal LMTK2 immunolabelling
   in AD, with implications for pathogenesis.},

Title = {Elevation gradients of lemur abundance emphasise the importance of
   Madagascar's lowland rainforest for the conservation of endemic taxa},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-37},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Elevation gradients correlate with changes in several environmental
   conditions and are known to be related to animal abundance. Animals in
   regions with a naturally limited extent of lowland rainforest are
   expected to have evolved adaptations to intermediate elevations that
   provided a stable environment during their evolution. Since the lowland
   rainforest of Madagascar has a limited extent and suffers from
   increasing anthropogenic pressure, it is essential to understand how
   well species tolerate intermediate and high elevations. In this study,
   we aim to quantify the relationship between lemur abundance and
   elevation in the eastern rainforest of Madagascar. We correlated
   abundance data on 26 lemur species (10 genera), including 492 records
   from 26 studies, with elevation. We analysed the consistency of
   correlations across species with a meta-analytical approach. We
   controlled for species' body mass, elevational range and median
   elevation. We then ran generalised linear mixed models to determine
   whether lemur abundance was related to elevation, body mass, plant
   productivity and anthropogenic disturbance. Overall, the abundance of
   lemur species in Malagasy rainforests was negatively correlated with
   elevation, and species occupying broader elevational ranges showed
   stronger correlations. Body mass was not related to species' tolerance
   of high elevations. Even though several lemur species are able to occupy
   the entire elevation gradient, the few remaining patches of lowland
   rainforests host lemur species at greater abundances than other sites.
   Abundance across species was negatively related to body mass, elevation
   and seasonality in plant productivity and positively related to plant
   productivity. Despite the ecological flexibility of many lemur species,
   the remnant patches of lowland rainforests host the highest levels of
   lemur abundance and are key to lemur conservation. It is crucial to
   preserve this priority habitat both for biodiversity conservation and
   for our understanding of lemur adaptations.},

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Alarm vocalizations are a common feature of the mammalian antipredator
   response. The meaning and function of these calls vary between species,
   with some species using calls to reference-specific categories of
   predators. Species can also use more than just the calls of conspecifics
   to detect threat, `eavesdropping' on other species' signalling to avoid
   predation. However, the evidence to date for both referential signalling
   and eavesdropping within primates is limited. We investigated two
   sympatric populations of wild lemur, the Coquerel's sifaka Propithecus
   coquereli and the common brown lemur Eulemur fulvus, presenting them
   with playbacks of predator calls, conspecific alarm calls and
   heterospecific lemur alarm calls, and recorded their behavioural
   responses following the playbacks. Results suggest that the Coquerel's
   sifaka may have functionally referential alarm calls with high
   specificity for aerial predators, but there was no evidence for any
   referential nature of the other call investigated. Brown lemurs appear
   to have a mixed alarm system, with one call being specific with respect
   to aerial predators. The other call investigated appeared to reference
   terrestrial predators. However, it was also used in other contexts, so
   does not meet the criteria for functional reference. Both species showed
   evidence for heterospecific alarm call recognition, with both the
   Coquerel's sifaka and the brown lemurs responding appropriately to
   heterospecific aerial alarm calls.},

Title = {Strengths and Weaknesses of the Gray Mouse Lemur (Microcebus murinus) as
   a Model for the Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms and
   Neuropsychiatric Symptoms of Dementia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {To face the load of the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the aging
   population, there is an urgent need to develop more translatable animal
   models with similarities to humans in both the symptomatology and
   physiopathology of dementia. Due to their close evolutionary similarity
   to humans, non-human primates (NHPs) are of primary interest. Of the
   NHPs, to date, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) has shown
   promising evidence of its translatability to humans. The present review
   reports the known advantages and limitations of using this species at
   all levels of investigation in the context of neuropsychiatric
   conditions. In this easily bred Malagasy primate with a relatively short
   life span (approximately 12 years), age-related cognitive decline,
   amyloid angiopathy, and risk factors (i.e., glucoregulatory imbalance)
   are congruent with those observed in humans. More specifically,
   analogous behavioral and psychological symptoms and neuropsychiatric
   symptoms of dementia (BPSD/NPS) to those in humans can be found in the
   aging mouse lemur. Aged mouse lemurs show typical age-related
   alterations of locomotor activity daily rhythms such as decreased rhythm
   amplitude, increased fragmentation, and increased activity during the
   resting-sleeping phase of the day and desynchronization with the
   light-dark cycle. In addition, sleep deprivation successfully induces
   cognitive deficits in adult mouse lemurs, and the effectiveness of
   approved cognitive enhancers such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or
   N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists is demonstrated in sleep-deprived
   animals. This result supports the translational potential of this animal
   model, especially for unraveling the mechanisms underlying dementia and
   for developing novel therapeutics to prevent age-associated cognitive
   decline. In conclusion, actual knowledge of BPSD/NPS-like symptoms of
   age-related cognitive deficits in the gray mouse lemur and the recent
   demonstration of the similarity of these symptoms with those seen in
   humans offer promising new ways of investigating both the prevention and
   treatment of pathological aging.},

Title = {An empirical estimate of the generation time of mouse lemurs},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Abstract = {The generation time of organisms drives the rate of change in
   populations and across evolutionary times. In long-lived species,
   generation time should also account for overlapping generations, and the
   average age of parents has been proposed as a best approximation under
   these conditions. This study uses this definition to estimate the
   generation time of a widely studied small primate, Microcebus murinus,
   based on parentage data generated for a free-living population over a
   6-year period in northwestern Madagascar. The average age of parents was
   calculated separately for mothers and fathers of three different
   offspring cohorts that differed in the degree of demographic
   uncertainty. In addition, adult survival rates were calculated for males
   and females based on long-term capture data from the same population to
   estimate the possible upper limits of generation time. Adult survival
   was low with only 44\% of adult females and 38\% of adult males being
   recaptured at the beginning of their second breeding season. The average
   age of mothers was 1.56-1.91 years, pointing toward a 2-year female
   generation time due to the high proportion of 1-year old mothers in all
   three cohorts. Female generation time estimates were fairly stable
   across the three offspring cohorts. In contrast, the average age of
   fathers differed by more than 1 year from the first to the third
   offspring cohort (1.71-2.83 years) pointing toward a 3-year generation
   time, but also suggesting a higher degree of demographic uncertainty in
   the early years of the study. For future modeling purposes, we,
   therefore, propose to use the average, 2.5 years, of male and female
   values as new estimate for the generation time of mouse lemurs.},

Abstract = {Mouse lemurs are the smallest of extant primates and are thought to
   resemble early primates in many ways. We provide histological
   descriptions of the major sensory nuclei of the dorsal thalamus and the
   superior colliculus (SC) of mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). The
   dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus has the six layers typical of
   strepsirrhine primates, with matching pairs of magnocellular,
   parvocellular, and koniocellular layers, one of each pair for each eye.
   Unlike most primates, magnocellular and parvocellular layers exhibit
   only small differences in cell size. All layers express vesicular
   glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), reflecting terminations of retinal
   inputs, and the expression of VGLUT2 is much less dense in the
   koniocellular layers. Parvalbumin is densely expressed in all layers,
   while SMI-32 is densely expressed only in the magnocellular layers. The
   adjoining pulvinar complex has a posterior nucleus with strong VGLUT2
   expression, reflecting terminations from the SC. The SC is laminated
   with dense expression of VGLUT2 in the upper superficial gray layer,
   reflecting terminations from the retina. The ventral (MGNv), medial, and
   dorsal divisions of the medial geniculate complex are only moderately
   differentiated, although patches of dense VGLUT2 expression are found
   along the outer border of MGNv. The ventroposterior nucleus has darkly
   stained cells in Nissl stained sections, and narrow septa separating
   patchy regions of dense VGLUT2 expression that likely represent
   different body parts. Overall, these structures resemble those in other
   strepsirrhine primates, although they are smaller, with the sensory
   nuclei appearing to occupy proportionately more of the dorsal thalamus
   than in larger primates.},

Abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation are major ecological forces threatening
   animal communities across the globe. These issues are especially true in
   Madagascar, where forest loss is ongoing. We examined the effects of
   forest fragmentation on the distribution and abundance of sympatric,
   endemic gray, and golden-brown mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus and
   Microcebus ravelobensis), the endemic western tuft-tailed rat (Eliurus
   myoxinus), and the invasive black rat (Rattus rattus) in two regions in
   northwestern Madagascar. We used systematic capture procedures in 40
   forest fragments and four continuous forest sites which differed in
   size, shape, and degree of isolation. With a trapping effort of 11,567
   trap nights during two dry seasons (2017-2018), we captured 929
   individuals (432 M. ravelobensis, 196 M. murinus, 116 E. myoxinus, and
   185 R. rattus). We examined the influence of study region, forest type
   (fragment vs. continuous), forest size, forest shape, the proportion of
   50-m forest edge and distance to continuous forest on the abundance and
   interaction of the four species. Responses to fragmentation differed
   strongly between species, but no interaction could be detected between
   the abundance of the different species. Thus competition within and
   between native and invasive species may not be regulating abundances in
   these regions. On the contrary, the abundance of M. ravelobensis and E.
   myoxinus differed significantly between study regions and was negatively
   affected by fragmentation. In contrast, there was no evidence of an
   impact of fragmentation on the abundance of M. murinus. Finally, the
   invasive R. rattus responded positively to the increasing distance to
   the continuous forest. In conclusion, the response of small Malagasy
   mammals to forest fragmentation varies largely between species, and
   fragmentation effects need to be examined at a species-specific level to
   fully understand their ecological dynamics and complexity.},

Abstract = {This article explores some rare sides of twin research. The focus of
   this article is the sad plight of the Dionne quintuplets, born in Canada
   in 1934. However, several other studies belong in this category, such as
   Dr Josef Mengele's horrifying twin research conducted at the Auschwitz
   concentration camp, Dr John Money's misguided attempt to turn an
   accidentally castrated male twin into a female, Russian scientists'
   cruel medical study of conjoined female twins and Dr Peter Neubauer's
   secret project that tracked the development of separated twins. Reviews
   of current twin research span twins' representation of self-image, twins
   with Kleine-Levin Syndrome, heteropaternal twinning in lemurs and
   factors affecting risk of dental caries. Media coverage includes a pair
   of high-society models, a book about the `Winkelevii' twins, Super Bowl
   twin teammates, a family with three sets of fraternal twins, a twin
   sister surrogate and a near presidential twin.},

Title = {Heritability and genetic correlations of personality, life history and

Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {The recent interest in animal personality has sparked a number of
   studies on the heritability of personality traits. Yet, how the sources
   variance these traits can be decomposed remains unclear. Moreover,
   whether genetic correlations with life-history traits, personality
   traits and other phenotypic traits exist as predicted by the
   pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis remains poorly understood. Our aim was
   to compare the heritability of personality, life-history and
   morphological traits and their potential genetic correlations in a small
   primate (Microcebus murinus). We performed an animal model analysis on
   six traits measured in a large sample of captive mouse lemurs (N = 486).
   We chose two personality traits, two life-history traits and two
   morphological traits to (i) estimate the genetic and/or environmental
   contribution to their variance, and (ii) test for genetic correlations
   between these traits. We found modest narrow-sense heritability for
   personality traits, morphological traits and life-history traits. Other
   factors including maternal effects also influence the sources of
   variation in life-history and morphological traits. We found genetic
   correlations between emergence latency on the one hand and radius length
   and growth rate on the other hand. Emergence latency was also
   genetically correlated with birth weight and was influenced by maternal
   identity. These results provide insights into the influence of genes and
   maternal effects on the partitioning of sources of variation in
   personality, life-history and morphological traits in a captive primate
   model and suggest that the pace-of-life syndrome may be partly explained
   by genetic trait covariances.},

Abstract = {Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) was recently identified as a novel
   cancer-related gene in several human cancers. However, little is known
   of its function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we aim to
   investigate the expression pattern, biological function, and regulatory
   mechanism of LMTK2 in HCC. We found that LMTK2 was highly expressed in
   HCC tissues, and patients with high expression of LMTK2 in tumor tissues
   had shorter survival times. LMTK2 expression was also elevated in HCC
   cell lines, and LMTK2 silencing markedly repressed the proliferation and
   invasion of HCC cells. By contrast, LMTK2 overexpression exerted
   promotion effects on HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Our results
   demonstrate that LMTK2 silencing decreases the phosphorylation of
   glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta and the expression of an
   active beta-catenin protein, leading to inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin
   signaling. Notably, GSK-3 beta inhibition significantly reversed the
   LMTK2 silencing-mediated antitumor effect on proliferation, invasion,
   and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in HCC cells. LMTK2 silencing retarded
   the tumor growth of HCC cells in an in vivo xenograft tumor model,
   associated with downregulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. In
   conclusion, our findings suggest that silencing of LMTK2 suppresses the
   proliferation and invasion of HCC cells through the inhibition of
   Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, via GSK-3 beta, highlighting the importance
   of LMTK2/GSK-3 beta/Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in HCC progression. (C)

Title = {Litter sex composition affects first reproduction in female grey mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus murinus)},
Journal = {PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {208},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Conditions during early development can have long-lasting consequences
   on behavioural phenotypes, reproduction and survival. We studied the
   consequences of matemal characteristics and litter sex composition on
   the reproductive fitness of 849 females during their first reproductive
   season in a captive population of mouse lemurs. In this primate, litters
   usually comprise 1 to 3 offspring. For female offspring, body mass at
   birth or at weaning did not depend on the parity of the mother but was
   strongly linked to the size of the litter with significant lowest body
   mass in triplets. Body mass during early growth has no effect on females
   reproductive success, but a low body mass during oestrus led to more
   unsuccessful mating, regardless of the litter composition. Successful
   pregnancy was negatively correlated to the presence of a brother in the
   litter in which they were born. Moreover, the oestrogen levels at
   oestrus were significantly reduced by 30\% in females born with male
   litter mates, suggesting a potential masculinisation in utero of these
   female offspring. Finally, a decrease in oestrogen values at oestrus is
   associated with the production of male-biased litters. These results
   should help stimulate further debate on the importance of littermates'
   long-term effects on individual life history traits, especially in the
   context of manipulation of the offspring sex ratio that is assumed to
   increase parental fitness.},

Abstract = {Human lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3) is an oncogenic kinase known to
   regulate ER-alpha through phosphorylation and is considered to be a
   novel therapeutic target for breast cancer. In this work, we have
   studied the ATP-binding mechanism with LMTK3 domain and also carried out
   virtual screening on LMTK3 to identify lead compounds using Dock blaster
   server. The top scored compounds obtained from Dock blaster were then
   narrowed down further to six lead compounds (ZINC37996511, ZINC83363046,
   ZINC3745998, ZINC50456700, ZINC83351792 and ZINC83364581) based on
   high-binding affinity and non-bonding interactions with LMTK3 using
   Autodock 4.2 program. We found in comparison to ATP, the lead compounds
   bind relatively stronger to LMTK3. The relative binding free energy
   results from MM-PBSA/GBSA method further indicate the strong binding
   affinity of lead compounds over ATP to LMTK3 in the dynamic system.
   Further, potential of mean force (PMF) study for ATP and lead compounds
   with LMTK3 have been performed to explore the unbinding processes and
   the free energy barrier. From the PMF results, we observed that the lead
   compounds have higher dissociation energy barriers than the ATP. Our
   findings suggest that these lead compounds may compete with ATP, and
   could act as probable potential inhibitors for LMTK3.},

Title = {Local habitat, not phylogenetic relatedness, predicts gut microbiota
   better within folivorous than frugivorous lemur lineages},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Both host phylogenetic placement and feeding strategy influence the
   structure of the gut microbiome (GMB); however, parsing their relative
   contributions presents a challenge. To meet this challenge, we compared
   GMB structure in two genera of lemurs characterized by different dietary
   specializations, the frugivorous brown lemurs (Eulemur spp.) and the
   folivorous sifakas (Propithecus spp.). These genera sympatrically occupy
   similar habitats (dry forests and rainforests) and diverged over similar
   evolutionary timescales. We collected fresh faeces from 12 species (six
   per host genus), at seven sites across Madagascar, and sequenced the 16S
   rRNA gene to determine GMB membership, diversity and variability. The
   lemurs' GMBs clustered predominantly by host genus; nevertheless, within
   genera, host relatedness did not predict GMB distance between species.
   The GMBs of brown lemurs had greater evenness and diversity, but were
   more homogeneous across species, whereas the GMBs of sifakas were
   differentiated between habitats. Thus, over relatively shallow
   timescales, environmental factors can override the influence of host
   phylogenetic placement on GMB phylogenetic composition. Moreover,
   feeding strategy can underlie the relative strength of host-microbiome
   coadaptation, with Madagascar's folivores perhaps requiring locally
   adapted GMBs to facilitate their highly specialized diets.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {The survival cost of reproduction has been revealed in many free-ranging
   vertebrates. However, recent studies on captive populations failed to
   detect this cost. Theoretically, this lack of survival/reproduction
   trade-off is expected when resources are not limiting, but these studies
   may have failed to detect the cost, as they may not have fully accounted
   for potential confounding effects, in particular interindividual
   heterogeneity. Here, we investigated the effects of current and past
   reproductive effort on later survival in captive females of a small
   primate, the gray mouse lemur. Survival analyses showed no cost of
   reproduction in females; and the pattern was even in the opposite
   direction: the higher the reproductive effort, the higher the chances of
   survival until the next reproductive event. These conclusions hold even
   while accounting for interindividual heterogeneity. In agreement with
   aforementioned studies on captive vertebrates, these results remind us
   that reproduction is expected to be traded against body maintenance and
   the survival prospect only when resources are so limiting that they
   induce an allocation trade-off. Thus, the cost of reproduction has a
   major extrinsic component driven by environmental conditions.},

Title = {Heteropaternity of twins in ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {169},
Number = {2},
Pages = {270-278},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives This project investigated paternity among 14 sets of twins
   born into a colony of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) on St. Catherines
   Island, GA. Female L. catta commonly mate with >1 male, and twins of
   different sexes confirm that dizygotic twinning can occur in this
   species. However, no study has previously evaluated twins using genetic
   data to measure the proportion of mono versus dizygotic twinning in L.
   catta, and no study has tested for heteropaternity (sirehood by two
   different males) in this species. We predicted that L. catta would show
   a predominance of dizygosity and evidence for heteropaternity. Materials
   and methods Paternity was determined for 28 infants (14 sets of twins)
   via paternity exclusion analyses using 10 polymorphic microsatellite
   markers, and data were collected on sexual behavior across four mating
   seasons during the first cycle of mating in each year, which overlapped
   with the conceptive periods of these infants. Results All twins were
   found to be dizygotic, as evidenced by dissimilar multilocus genotypes
   between the two infants of each twin pair. Heteropaternity was found in
   3 of 14 (21\% of) twin pairs, whereas the remaining 11 pairs of twins
   (79\%) shared the same sire. In one case of heteropaternity, one sire
   was a resident male, and one sire was an extra-group male. An
   extra-group male also sired one of the same-sire twin pairs. All other
   sires of twins were group residents. Discussion Female multiple mating,
   which is common to many primates including L. catta, can be viewed as an
   adaptive reproductive strategy whose function-in addition to fertility
   assurance or stimulating sperm competition-may be to increase the
   genetic diversity of a female's offspring, even among infants born in
   the same birth event. Therefore, during the course of primate evolution,
   the adaptive benefits of heteropaternity would be expected to have
   contributed to positive selection for female promiscuity.},

Title = {Sources of variation in social tolerance in mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   spp.)},
Journal = {BMC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {BackgroundSocial tolerance strongly influences the patterns of
   affiliation and aggression in animal societies. However, not much is
   known about the variation of social tolerance in species living in
   dispersed social systems that combine solitary foraging activities with
   the need of coordinating social interactions with conspecifics on a
   regular basis. This study aims to investigate the sources of variation
   in social tolerance within a Malagasy primate radiation with dispersed
   social systems, the mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.). Six mouse lemur
   species were selected as model species that belong to three different
   taxonomic clades, live in two types of forest environments (dry and
   humid), and differed in this study with respect to their reproductive
   activity. Six male-female and six male-male dyads of each species were
   tested temporarily in a standardized social encounter paradigm in
   Madagascar to collect data on joint use of space, non-agonistic body
   contacts, aggression rates, the number of conflicts and the
   establishment of intra- and intersexual dominance.ResultsMale-female
   dyads of the six species differed significantly in the frequency of
   affiliative and agonistic behaviors. In contrast, the variations between
   male-male dyads could not be explained by one parameter only, but clade
   membership, forest type, reproductive state as well as species were all
   suggested to be partially influential. Only one species (Microcebus
   mamiratra) showed signals of unambiguous female dominance in all
   male-female dyads, whereas the others had no or only a few dyads with
   female dominance.ConclusionsVariations in social tolerance and its
   consequences are most likely influenced by two factors, ecology (via
   forest type) and physiology (via reproductive activity), and only to a
   lesser extent by clade membership. The study suggests that mouse lemur
   females have higher aggression rates and more agonistic conflicts with
   males when females in the population are reproducing, at least in
   resource-rich humid forests. The study confirms a high degree of social
   plasticity between species in these small solitary foragers that
   supports their taxonomic distinctiveness and requires further scientific
   attention.},

Volume = {308},

Abstract = {In primates, grasping constitutes a vital function involved in many
   behaviors. Anatomical specializations of the prehensile extremities
   originated early-on in their evolution. However, the precise functional
   and ecological contexts that have driven this evolution remain unclear.
   Interspecific comparative studies show that a given morphology can
   induce different grasping behaviors and also that a given behavior can
   be performed using different morphological structures. In this context,
   an intraspecific ontogenetic approach offers the opportunity to describe
   the relations between patterns in grasping behavior and patterns of
   grasping morphology. We quantified manual grasping strategies and the
   associated morphometric (i.e. segments lengths) and performance (i.e.
   pull strength) traits for both limbs during the development of a small
   arboreal primate, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). Our results
   show an early onset of grasping in young mouse lemurs. Moreover, younger
   individuals had relative longer hindlimbs (i.e. tibia and metatarsus)
   allowing them to have near-maximal levels of grasping strength. This
   very fast development despite an incomplete neuromuscular development
   highlights the importance of this grasping function directly after
   birth.},

Abstract = {Lemuricola (Protenterobius) nycticebi is the only pinworm species known
   to infect strepsirrhine primates outside Africa, and the only pinworm
   species yet described in slow lorises. Here, we provided a detailed
   morphological comparison of female and male worms, and a first
   description of fourth-stage larvae collected from free-living slow
   lorises (Nycticebus menagensis) in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Using
   mitochondrial and nuclear markers, we also reconstructed the species'
   phylogenetic relationship with other pinworms infecting primates. Both
   morphological and molecular results indicated a distinct association
   between L. (P.) nycticebi and its host. However, while taxonomy
   identified this species as a member of the Lemuricola clade and grouped
   pinworms infecting lemurs and slow lorises together, phylogenetic
   reconstruction split them, placing L. (P.) nycticebi within the
   Enterobius clade. Our results suggest that L. (P.) nycticebi may
   represent a different taxon altogether, and that it is more closely
   related to pinworm species infecting Old World primates outside

Abstract = {Collective movements are essential for maintaining group cohesion.
   However, group members can have different optimal departure times,
   depending on individual, social and contextual factors whose relative
   importance remains poorly known. We, therefore, studied collective
   departures in four groups of red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) in
   Kirindy Forest, Madagascar, to investigate the influence of an
   individual's age, sex, their affiliative relationships and their
   proximity to other group members at the time of departure on their
   individual departure decision. We recorded behavioural and spatial data
   on individual departures during 167 group movements and conducted group
   scans (181-279 per group) to assess affiliative relationships. All
   factors influenced individual departures. Both affiliation and proximity
   determined a mimetic joining process in which dyads with stronger
   affiliative bonds departed in closer succession, and individuals
   followed the initiator and predecessors more quickly when they were in
   closer proximity at departure. While the influence of affiliation is
   common, the effect of inter-individual distance has rarely been
   considered in groups with heterogeneous social relationships. Although
   local rules influenced joining, the overall movement pattern was mainly
   determined by individual traits: juveniles took protected central
   positions, while females made up the van and males brought up the rear.
   Individual needs, expressed in the departure order, to an extent
   overruled the effect of affiliation. These results highlight the
   importance of considering individual, social and contextual factors
   collectively in the study of collective movements.},

Abstract = {Mouse lemurs are the smallest of the living primates, and are members of
   the understudied radiation of strepsirrhine lemurs of Madagascar. They
   are thought to closely resemble the ancestral primates that gave rise to
   present day primates. Here we have used multiple histological and
   immunochemical methods to identify and characterize sensory areas of
   neocortex in four brains of adult lemurs obtained from a licensed
   breeding colony. We describe the laminar features for the primary visual
   area (V1), the secondary visual area (V2), the middle temporal visual
   area (MT) and area prostriata, somatosensory areas S1(3b), 3a, and area
   1, the primary motor cortex (M1), and the primary auditory cortex (A1).
   V1 has ``blobs{''} with ``nonblob{''} surrounds, providing further
   evidence that this type of modular organization might have evolved early
   in the primate lineage to be retained in all extant primates. The
   laminar organization of V1 further supports the view that sublayers of
   layer 3 of primates have been commonly misidentified as sublayers of
   layer 4. S1 (area 3b) is proportionately wider than the elongated area
   observed in anthropoid primates, and has disruptions that may
   distinguish representations of the hand, face, teeth, and tongue.
   Primary auditory cortex is located in the upper temporal cortex and may
   include a rostral area, R, in addition to A1. The resulting
   architectonic maps of cortical areas in mouse lemurs can usefully guide
   future studies of cortical connectivity and function.},

Abstract = {Subsistence hunting presents a conservation challenge by which
   biodiversity preservation must be balanced with safeguarding of human
   livelihoods. Globally, subsistence hunting threatens primate
   populations, including Madagascar's endemic lemurs. We used population
   viability analysis to assess the sustainability of lemur hunting in
   Makira Natural Park, Madagascar. We identified trends in seasonal
   hunting of 11 Makira lemur species from household interview data,
   estimated local lemur densities in populations adjacent to focal
   villages via transect surveys, and quantified extinction vulnerability
   for these populations based on species-specific demographic parameters
   and empirically derived hunting rates. We compared stage-based
   Lefkovitch with periodic Leslie matrices to evaluate the impact of
   regional dispersal on persistence trajectories and explored the
   consequences of perturbations to the timing of peak hunting relative to
   the lemur birth pulse, under assumptions of density-dependent
   reproductive compensation. Lemur hunting peaked during the
   fruit-abundant wet season (March-June). Estimated local lemur densities
   were roughly inverse to body size across our study area. Life-history
   modeling indicated that hunting most severely threatened the species
   with the largest bodies (i.e., Hapalemur occidentalis, Avahi laniger,
   Daubentonia madagascariensis, and Indri indi), characterized by late-age
   reproductive onsets and long interbirth intervals. In model simulations,
   lemur dispersal within a regional metapopulation buffered extinction
   threats when a majority of local sites supported growth rates above the
   replacement level but drove regional extirpations when most local sites
   were overharvested. Hunt simulations were most detrimental when timed to
   overlap lemur births (a reality for D. madagascariensis and I. indri).
   In sum, Makira lemurs were overharvested. Regional extirpations, which
   may contribute to broad-scale extinctions, will be likely if current
   hunting rates persist. Cessation of anthropogenic lemur harvest is a
   conservation priority, and development programs are needed to help
   communities switch from wildlife consumption to domestic protein
   alternatives.},

Abstract = {The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a highly polymorphic and
   polygenic genomic region that plays a crucial role in immune-related
   diseases. Given the need for comparative studies on the variability of
   immunologically important genes among wild populations and species, we
   investigated the allelic variation of MHC class II DRB among three
   congeneric true lemur species: the red-fronted lemur (Eulemur
   rufifrons), red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer), and black lemur
   (Eulemur macaco). We noninvasively collected hair and faecal samples
   from these species across different regions in Madagascar. We assessed
   DRB exon 2 polymorphism with a newly developed primer set, amplifying
   nearly all non-synonymous codons of the antigen-binding sites. We
   defined 26 DRB alleles from 45 individuals (17 alleles from E. rufifrons
   (N=18); 5 from E. rubriventer (N=7); and 4 from E. macaco (N=20). All
   detected alleles are novel and show high levels of nucleotide (26.8\%)
   and non-synonymous codon polymorphism (39.4\%). In these lemur species,
   we found neither evidence of a duplication of DRB genes nor a sharing of
   alleles among sympatric groups or allopatric populations of the same
   species. The non-sharing of alleles may be the result of a geographical
   separation over a long time span and/or different pathogen selection
   pressures. We found dN/dS rates >1 in the functionally important antigen
   recognition sites, providing evidence for balancing selection.
   Especially for small and isolated populations, quantifying and
   monitoring DRB variation are recommended to establish successful
   conservation plans that mitigate the possible loss of immunogenetic
   diversity in lemurs.},

   Among placental mammals, trichromatic vision is unique to primates and
   is argued to be adaptive for foraging on reddish food. However,
   trichromacy is variably present in lemurs, including species within the
   cathemeral genus Eulemur, due to inter- and intra-specific variation in
   X-linked opsin genes. Although this variation could result from genetic
   drift, it could also reflect ecological adaptation. To understand
   ecological contributions to color vision variation, we examined cone
   opsin genes of 11 Eulemur species. We found that only E. flavifrons and
   E. macaco have polymorphic trichromacy. Most dichromatic species have an
   M (green-shifted) opsin; uniquely, one species (E. rubriventer) has
   dichromacy based on an L (red-shifted) opsin. This latter result appears
   to represent loss of polymorphic trichromacy from a dichromatic (M
   opsin) or polymorphic Eulemur ancestor. To address potential ecological
   explanations for opsin variation, we studied the dietary behavior of
   wild E. rubriventer and collected reflectance spectra from plant species
   consumed. Visual models suggest that trichromacy should provide an
   advantage for detecting reddish foods; however, luminance contrasts were
   greatest for dichromats with the L opsin. As E. rubriventer are often
   active in low-light rainforest conditions, luminance cues may be
   relatively important, which could favor the L opsin, while also leading
   to relaxed selection on, or selection against, trichromacy. The presence
   of different opsin alleles across Eulemur species could represent
   adaptations related to diet, activity pattern, or habitat.Significance
   statementLoss of genetic variation, often thought to be maladaptive, can
   occur through natural selection. Among primates, some species have
   trichromatic color vision, the ability to distinguish reddish and
   greenish hues; others are red-green colorblind (dichromatic). We
   examined adaptive explanations for color vision differences by studying
   cone opsin genes and behavior in wild lemurs (Eulemur)a genus that is
   active both day and night. We found that color vision is variable in
   Eulemur species, and full trichromatic vision was likely lost in at
   least one lineage. Foraging ecology of dichromatic Eulemur rubriventer
   indicates that trichromatic vision should be advantageous for foraging
   on reddish foods, but brightness cues are more salient to this species'
   vision. We suggest brightness may be more important than color to this
   species, particularly at night, and loss of trichromacy could be
   adaptive in some lemurs.},

Abstract = {An animal's fitness is influenced by the ability to move safely through
   its environment. Recent models have shown that aspects of body geometry,
   for example, limb length and center of mass (COM) position, appear to
   set limits for pitch control in cursorial quadrupeds. Models of pitch
   control predict that the body shape of these and certain other primates,
   with short forelimbs and posteriorly positioned COM, should allow them
   to decelerate rapidly while minimizing the risk of pitching forward. We
   chose to test these models in two non-cursorial lemurs: Lemur catta, the
   highly terrestrial ring-tailed lemur, and Eulemur fulvus, the highly
   arboreal brown lemur. We modeled the effects of changes in limb length
   and COM position on maximum decelerative potential for both species, as
   well as collecting data on maximal decelerations across whole strides.
   In both species, maximum measured decelerations fell below the range of
   pitch-limited deceleration values predicted by the geometric model, with
   the ring-tailed lemur approaching its pitch limit more closely. Both
   lemurs showed decelerative potential equivalent to or higher than
   horses, the only comparative model currently available. These data
   reinforce the hypothesis that a relatively simple model of body geometry
   can predict aspects of maximum performance in animals. In this case, it
   appears that the body geometry of primates is skewed toward avoiding
   forward pitch in maximal decelerations.},

Abstract = {Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2 (LMTK2) is a recently cloned transmembrane
   protein, actually a serine/threonine kinase named after the Madagascar
   primate lemur due to the long intracellular C-terminal tail. LMTK2 is
   relatively little known, compared to other kinases but its role has been
   increasingly recognized. Published data show that LMTK2 regulates key
   cellular events, including endocytic trafficking, nerve growth factor
   signaling, apoptosis, and Cl transport. Abnormalities in the expression
   and function of LMTK2 are associated with human disease, such as
   neurodegeneration, cancer and infertility. We summarized the current
   state of knowledge on LMTK2 structure, regulation, interactome,
   intracellular localization, and tissue expression and point out future
   research directions to better understand the role of LMTK2.},

Abstract = {Eels are a freshwater fish commodity that has a high economic value,
   particularly in Indonesia. Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and
   Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) are a type of omega-3 which is the most
   dominant in fish oil. EPA and DHA are not produced by the fish's body
   itself, but rather, it is produced by marine plants like algae. EPA and
   DHA have an important role in the growth and function of the brain of
   the organism, including eels. This study aimed to improve the content of
   EPA and DHA in eels. This research used an experimental method with a
   randomized complete design consisting of five treatments with four
   replications. The analysis of the data was conducted using the Variant
   Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test. If there were any differences among
   the treatments, then the analysis would be continued with Duncan's
   Multiple Range Test. The results showed that the EPA and DHA content of
   the meat increased with the addition of lemuru oil. The DHA content in
   eel meat in this study was directly proportional to the content of DHA
   in the formula feed. The addition of lemuru fish oil by 6\% could
   increase the EPA content up to 2.8709\%. It could also increase the DHA
   content up to 1.2951\%.},

Abstract = {The lemurs of Madagascar (Primates: Lemuriformes) are a monophyletic
   group that has lived in isolation from other primates for about 50
   million years. Lemurs have diversified into species with diverse daily
   activity patterns and correspondingly different visual adaptations. We
   assessed the arrangements of retinal cone and rod photoreceptors in six
   nocturnal, three cathemeral and two diurnal lemur species and quantified
   different parameters in six of the species. The analysis revealed lower
   cone densities and higher rod densities in the nocturnal than in the
   cathemeral and diurnal species. The photoreceptor densities in the
   diurnal Propithecus verreauxi indicate a less ``diurnal{''} retina than
   found in other diurnal primates. Immunolabeling for cone opsins showed
   the presence of both middle-to-longwave sensitive (M/L) and shortwave
   sensitive (S) cones in most species, indicating at least dichromatic
   color vision. S cones were absent in Allocebus trichotis and
   Cheirogaleus medius, indicating cone monochromacy. In the Microcebus
   species, the S cones had an inverse topography with very low densities
   in the central retina and highest densities in the peripheral retina.
   The S cones in the other species and the M/L cones in all species had a
   conventional topography with peak densities in the central area. With
   the exception of the cathemeral Eulemur species, the eyes of all studied
   taxa, including the diurnal Propithecus, possessed a tapetum lucidum, a
   feature only found among nocturnal and crepuscular mammals.},

   glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) analysis. While the frequency of certain
   comfort behaviour patterns decreased (P < 0.05) in response to transport
   and change of the environment, grooming, resting, sleeping as well as
   playful behaviour (chasing, climbing) were not affected (P > 0.05). No
   changes were found in the frequency of behaviour connected to metabolic
   events with the exception of defecation. Lemur females defecated more
   frequently (P < 0.05) in their new environment. The frequency of neither
   fear nor exploratory behaviour differed (P > 0.05) before and after
   transport. The positive effect of the novelty was shown by the reduction
   (P < 0.01) of behavioural signs of frustration and stereotypical
   behaviour after transport. In response to transport, a significant (P <
   0.05) increase of FGM levels was found the second day after the
   transport, reaching peak levels in the morning and starting to decline
   to baseline levels in the afternoon. The results of both behaviour and
   adrenocortical activity analysis suggest that despite some presented
   changes in the monitored indices prior and after transport, the
   transportation under the studied conditions presented only a mild
   stressor with limited behavioural and glucocorticoid responses.},

Abstract = {Captive primates are susceptible to infection with cestodes of the
   family of Taeniidae. This report describes the infection of a
   five-year-old female ring tailed-lemur (Lemur catta) in Salzburg Zoo
   (Salzburg, Austria) with Taenia crassiceps. Necropsy revealed extensive
   amounts of organized and free cysts in the thoracic cavity, completely
   encasing and compressing the lungs and the heart. Infection probably
   occurred by oral uptake of Taenia crassiceps eggs from faeces of red fox
   (Vulpes vulpes) within the zoo or in the surrounding park, where the
   lemurs roam freely. Two foxes shot in the vicinity of the zoo were
   confirmed to have an intestinal infection with Taenia crassiceps. The
   simultaneous detection of Taenia crassiceps tapeworms in a natural
   definite host (fox) and of their metacestodes in an accidental
   intermediate host provides evidence of an autochthonous infection.
   Compared to other zoo primates, ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) seem to
   be highly susceptible to infection with Taenia crassiceps. Therapy and
   preventive methods are discussed.},

Title = {Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 acts as a positive regulator of NF-kappa B
   activation and colon cancer cell proliferation},
Journal = {CANCER LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {454},
Pages = {70-77},
Abstract = {Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) belongs to both protein kinase and
   tyrosine kinase families. LMTK2 is less studied and little is known
   about its function. Here we demonstrate that LMTK2 modulates NF-kappa B
   activity and functions to promote colonic tumorigenesis. We found that
   LMTK2 protein was abundant in colon cancer cells and LMTK2 knockdown
   (LMTK2-KD) inhibited proliferation of colon cancer cells through
   inactivating NF-kappa B. In unstimulated condition, LMTK2 modulated
   NF-kappa B through inhibiting phosphorylation of p65 at Ser468.
   Mechanistically, LMTK2 phosphorylated protein phosphatase 1A (PP1A) to
   prevent PP1A from dephosphorylating p-GSK3 beta(Ser9). The p-GSK3
   beta(Ser9) could not phosphorylate p65 at Ser468, which maintained the
   basal NF-kappa B activity. LMTK2 also modulated TNF alpha-activated
   NF-kappa B. LMTK2-KD repressed TNF alpha-induced IKK beta
   phosphorylation, I kappa B alpha degradation and NF-kappa B activation,
   implying that LMTK2 modulates TNF alpha-activated NF-kappa B via UGC
   These results suggest that LMTK2 modulates basal and TNF alpha-induced
   NF-kappa B activities in different mechanisms. Animal studies show that
   LMTK2-KD suppressed colon cancer cell xenograft growth, decreased PP1A
   phosphorylation and increased p-p65(Ser468). Our results reveal the role
   and underlying mechanism of LMTK2 in colonic tumorigenesis and suggest
   that LMTK2 may serve as a potential target for chemotherapy of colon
   cancer.},

Abstract = {Diet overlap and the importance of plankton were investigated by
   comparing stomach contents and C-13 and N-15 isotopes using a Bayesian
   linear mixed model of early juvenile, juvenile and adult Sardinela

   Sea. Assimilated food of all life stages was mainly due to the
   preferential ingestion of large size meso-zooplankton at inshore areas
   while keeping the ability to ingest smaller zooplankton sizes. Few
   phytoplankton cells were ingested, and only by adults. Early juveniles
   and adults showed more depleted delta C-13 values than juveniles,
   indicating ontogenetic and spatial dietary shift with juveniles
   ingesting large herbivorous zooplankton in deeper inshore areas least
   influenced by terrestrial food particles. Hence, S. lemuru is chiefly an
   omnivorous zooplanktivore, but combined approaches of stomach contents
   and C and N stable isotope analyses provided new insights of its trophic
   ecology useful to the management of the species in the Sulu Sea.},

Abstract = {Here we report a case of severe growth retardation and neurologic
   abnormalities in a female gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), a small
   NHP species for which the genomic sequence recently became available.
   The female lemur we present here died on postnatal day 125. This lemur
   had impaired development of motor skills and showed severe ataxia and
   tremors. In addition, hearing seemed normal whereas ophthalmic
   examination revealed incipient bilateral cataracts, abnormal
   pigmentation in the lens of the left eye, and a missing optokinetic
   nystagmus, which indicated impaired vision. Most prominently, the lemur
   showed severe growth retardation. Necropsy revealed maldevelopment of
   the left reproductive organs and unilateral dilation of the right
   lateral ventricle, which was confirmed on brain MRI. Brain histology
   further revealed large, bilateral areas of vacuolation within the
   brainstem, but immunohistochemistry indicated no sign of pathologic
   prion protein deposition. Full genomic sequencing of the lemur revealed
   a probably pathologic mutation in LARGE2 of the LARGE gene family, which
   has been associated with congenital muscular dystrophies. However,
   potentially functional mutations in other genes were also present. The
   observed behavioral and motor signs in the presented animal might have
   been linked to spongiform degeneration and resulting brainstem
   dysfunction and progressive muscle weakness. The macroscopic
   developmental abnormalities and ophthalmic findings might be genetic in
   origin and linked to the mutation in LARGE2.},

Abstract = {Aim Species' distributions and abundances are primarily determined by
   the suitability of environmental conditions, including climate and
   interactions with sympatric species, but also increasingly by human
   activities. Modelling tools can help in assessing the extinction risk of
   affected species. By combining species distribution modelling of abiotic
   and biotic niches with population size modelling, we estimated the
   abundance of 19 lemur taxa in three regions, especially focusing on 10
   species that are considered Endangered or Critically Endangered.
   Location Taxa Madagascar. Lemurs (Primates) and angiosperm trees.
   Methods Results We used climate data, field samples, and published
   occurrence data on trees to construct species distribution models (SDM)
   for lemur food tree species. We then inferred the SDMs for lemurs based
   on the probability of occurrence of their food trees as well as climate.
   Finally, we used tree SDMs, topography, distance to the forest edge, and
   field estimates of lemur population density to predict lemur abundance
   in general linear models. The SDMs of lemur food trees were stronger
   predictors of the occurrence of lemurs than climate. The predicted
   probability of presence of food trees, slope, elevation, and distance
   from the forest edge were significant correlates of lemur density. We
   found that sixteen species had minimum estimated abundances greater than
   10,000 individuals over >1,000km(2). Three lemur species are especially
   threatened, with less than 2,500 individuals predicted for Cheirogaleus
   sibreei, and heavy hunting pressure for the relatively small populations
   of Indri indri and Hapalemur occidentalis. Main conclusions Biotic
   interactors were important variables in SDMs for lemurs, allowing
   refined estimates of ranges and abundances. This paper provides an
   analytical workflow that can be applied to other taxonomic groups to
   substantiate estimates of species' vulnerability to extinction.},

Title = {Nitrogen isotope (delta N-15) patterns for amino acids in lemur bones

Abstract = {Most endemic species with body masses >10 kg on Madagascar went extinct
   within the past 1000 years. The extent to which human predation,
   anthropogenic landscape transformation and aridification may separately
   or together explain this extinction pattern remains controversial. We
   present nitrogen isotope (delta N-15) values of individual amino acids
   preserved in bones from now-extinct Pachylemur insignis and extant
   Propithecus verreauxi from two subfossil sites in south-western
   Madagascar: Tsirave and Taolambiby. The amino acid-specific approach
   allows us to identify environmental signals that are otherwise difficult
   to recognize in bulk collagen delta N-15 values. Specifically, we use
   the delta N-15 values of source amino acids (phenylalanine and lysine)
   as a proxy for habitat aridity between ca. 4000 years ago and present
   and the spacing of delta N-15 values between trophic and source amino
   acids to quantify trophic levels for these two lemur species. Despite
   paleoenvironmental evidence for lowering water tables and the expansion
   of relatively arid savanna between 4000 and 1000 years ago, our isotope
   data suggest that these lemurs did not live in increasingly arid
   habitats and did not change their trophic level. Together, our results
   support the hypothesis that aridity alone did not play a major role in
   late Holocene megafaunal extinctions in south-western Madagascar.},

Title = {Does Calorie Restriction in Primates Increase Lifespan? Revisiting

Abstract = {The effects of calorie restriction have now been studied in two
   non-human primates, the macaque Macaca mulatta and the mouse lemur
   Microcebus murinus. The study on lemurs and one of the two studies on
   macaques have reported a lifespan increase. In this review, I argue that
   these results are better explained by a lifespan decrease in the control
   group because of a bad diet and/or overfeeding, rather than by a real
   lifespan increase in calorie-restricted animals. If these results can be
   readily translated to humans, it would mean that no beneficial effect of
   calorie restriction on lifespan can be expected in normal-weight or lean
   people, but that overweight and/or obese people could benefit to some
   extent from a decrease in excessive food intake.},

Title = {Maternal reproductive senescence shapes the fitness consequences of the

Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {285},

Abstract = {In humans, pronounced age differences between parents have deleterious
   fitness consequences. In particular, the number of children is lower
   when mothers are much older than fathers. However, previous analyses
   failed to disentangle the influence of differential parental age per se
   from a direct age effect of each parent. In this study, we analyse the
   fitness consequences of both parental age and parental age differences
   on litter size and offspring survival in two closely related species of
   lemurs living in captivity. As captive lemurs do not choose their
   reproductive partner, we were able to measure litter size and offspring
   survival across breeding pairs showing a wide range of parental age
   differences. However, we demonstrated that the effect of the parental
   age difference on litter size was fully accounted for by female
   reproductive senescence because females mating with much younger males
   were old females. On the other hand, both parental age difference and
   female reproductive senescence influenced offspring survival. Our
   results emphasize the importance of teasing apart the effect of parental
   reproductive senescence when investigating the health and fitness
   consequences of parental age differences and also provide new insights
   for conservation programmes of endangered species.},

Abstract = {The persistence of tropical rainforests, together with their flora and
   fauna, is highly threatened by anthropogenic disturbances. In this
   study, we investigate to what extent selective logging influences the
   structure and composition of a tropical rainforest in Madagascar and
   subsequently lemur encounter rates and cluster sizes. We quantified
   forest structure variables and conducted transect surveys of seven
   sympatric diurnal lemur species in five protected forest sites with
   different logging histories. We found that DBH, tree height, the
   interquartile ranges of DBH and tree height (measure of forest
   heterogeneity), tree species and family richness were relatively high
   and tree density was relatively low in less disturbed compared to
   disturbed sites. Although the disturbed forests have not fully recovered
   to previous conditions, they seem to have recovered from a functional
   perspective into suitable lemur habitat, as lemur encounter rates and
   cluster sizes were similar in disturbed and less disturbed sites. We
   only found slightly higher encounter rates for Varecia variegate (P =
   0.078) and lower encounter rates for Eulernur rufifrons (P = 0.059) in
   less disturbed forests. This is one of the first studies that report the
   presence of V. variegate, a species characterised by its drastic
   decline, in previously logged sites. Lemurs travelling between disturbed
   and less disturbed sites disperse seeds and hereby facilitate forest
   regeneration. Therefore, we promote the need for better attention to the
   value of logged forests for biodiversity conservation in Madagascar and
   suggest that there is considerable potential for regenerating logged
   forests to support lemur communities.},

Title = {Profiling caregivers: Hormonal variation underlying allomaternal care in

Journal = {PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR},

Volume = {193},
Number = {A, SI},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Neuroendocrine evidence suggests that paternal care is mediated by
   hormonal mechanisms, where hormonal changes in expectant and new fathers
   facilitate infant care. In species with obligate and extensive paternal
   care such as humans, androgen levels decline once males are paired and
   have offspring, and in direct response to offspring care. Facultative
   infant care is widespread in the Order Primates, but the underlying
   hormonal mechanisms are largely unknown. We found that wild, red-bellied
   lemurs living in family groups (two adults and their presumed offspring)
   varied in the amount of care they provided infants. The more fathers
   invested in helping infants (measured as a composite of carrying,
   holding, huddling, grooming, and playing), and specifically the more
   they huddled and groomed with infants, the higher their fecal androgen
   (fA) levels, contrary to expectations. Carrying was negatively related
   to fA levels. Helping by subadults and juveniles was not related to
   their own fA levels. Elevated fA levels during infant dependence have
   been observed in other vertebrate species, and are thought to reflect
   reinvestment in mating rather than investment in dependent offspring.
   However, red-bellied lemurs do not mate until after infants are weaned,
   and they have long-term pair-bonds, suggesting that elevated fA levels
   play a role in offspring care. These results support a growing body of
   research suggesting that elevated androgen levels do not inhibit
   protective infant care.},

   become generalized (diffuse coevolution). We tested this hypothesis for
   nocturnal Malagasy reddish-grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus griseorufus),
   predicting that related females and their young should create local
   aggregations of typical fruits consumed by mouse lemurs (small and
   green). Within our 5.7 ha site, animals disperse the seeds of ten plant
   species, forming aggregations associated with matriarchal core areas
   (2982 food plants recorded). Over 424 nights, we radio-tracked 25 males
   and 25 females and identified four gardens constructed by four
   matrilines and used as creches of weaned infants. Two green garden
   fruits produced by Maerua nudes (111 trees) and Viscum trachycarpum (94
   plants) were spatially associated, fruited during the crucial weaning
   period, and the germination of their seeds was enhanced by partial
   digestion. In the southern xerophytic forest, animals ingest the seeds
   of >= 25 plant species producing small green fruits. In the dry forests
   of Madagascar, most small zoochorous seeds are dispersed by mouse lemurs
   rather than birds. As predicted, mouse lemurs create complex gardens,
   i.e. species-rich plant aggregations dominated by species producing
   small green fruits.},

Abstract = {The propensity to flexibly innovate behavioural variants might advantage
   animals when dealing with novel or modified ecological or social
   challenges. Interspecific innovative abilities can be predicted by the
   degree of ecological generalism and intraspecific variation is predicted
   by personality traits. To examine the effects of these factors on
   innovation, we compared problem-solving abilities in the generalist grey
   mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) and the more specialized Madame
   Berthe's mouse lemurs (Microcebus berthae) in western Madagascar. We
   examined personality traits by testing 54 individuals in open field and
   novel object tests, and we assessed problem-solving abilities by
   presenting an artificial feeding-box that could be opened by three
   different techniques. The first two techniques presented novel problems
   and the third technique a modified problem to the more complex second
   novel problem. In both species, motivation, early success and better
   inhibitory control characterized innovators and predicted superior
   problem-solving performance. Although both species performed equally
   well in finding a solution to the novel problems, the specialist species
   was more efficient in finding a novel solution to a familiar problem.
   Since the ecological specialist also exhibited more inhibitory control
   in this task than the generalist, we propose that specialists may
   dispose of more efficient problem-solving behaviour.},

Title = {Effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on cognitive
   functions, electrocortical activity and neurogenesis in a non-human

Journal = {BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Among environmental factors that may affect on brain function, some
   nutrients and particularly n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA)
   are required for optimal brain development. Their effects on cognitive
   functions, however, are still unclear, and studies in humans and rodents
   have yielded contradictory results. We used a non-human primate model,
   the grey mouse lemur, phylogenetically close to human. The aim of this
   study was to demonstrate the impact of n-3 PUFA supplementation on
   cognitive functions, neuronal activity and neurogenesis. Two groups of
   animals whose diet was supplemented with either fish oil (rich in n-3
   PUFA) or olive oil as a control. These two groups were subjected to a
   visual discrimination task and to a test of anxiety in the open-field.
   In parallel, cortical activity was measured with telemetric ECoG
   recordings. Finally, adult neurogenesis was investigated ex vivo by
   means of immunohistochemistry. Animals supplemented with fish oil
   exhibited better visual discrimination performance and tended to have
   lower anxiety levels. Furthermore, supplementation increased the power
   of alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands in the EEG, which are related
   to various aspects of memory and decision-making. This study also
   provides the first evidence of the existence of adult neurogenesis
   process in a prosimian primate. Notably, lemurs supplemented with n-3
   PUFAs for 21 months exhibited a higher number of newly born neurons in
   brain areas related to memory and emotions, compared to control animals.
   Altogether, these results point to long-term positive effects of dietary
   n-3 PUFAs on various functions of the primate brain. Further studies
   will be needed to determine a formal causal link between behavioral
   improvement and creation of new neurons.},

Title = {Variation in reproduction of the smallest-bodied primate radiation, the
   mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.): A synopsis},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Reproduction is a fundamental trait in the life history of any species
   and contributes to species diversity and evolution. Here, we aim to
   review the barely known variation in reproductive patterns of the
   smallest-bodied primate radiation, the Malagasy mouse lemurs, focusing
   on twelve species of four phylogenetic clades. We present a new
   reproductive field dataset collected between May and November 1996-2016
   for nine species (Microcebus murinus, M. myoxinus, M. ravelobensis, M.
   bongolavensis, M. danfossi, M. sambiranensis, M. margothmarshae, M.
   mamiratra, and M. lehilahytsara) and add published field information on
   three additional species. In the majority of species, the estrus of
   females was recorded in the period of long days (day length longer than
   12hr), whereas male testes size increased about one to three months
   prior to this. Reproductive schedules varied considerably between the
   four clades. Sympatric species-pairs of different clades differed in the
   timing of female and male reproduction, suggesting strong phylogenetic
   constraints. Populations of the same species in a different ecological
   setting varied in the onset of reproduction, suggesting substantial
   environmental plasticity. Warm temperatures and rainfall throughout the
   year may allow for less expressed reproductive seasonality. Our results
   suggest that an interplay between phylogenetic relatedness, ambient
   temperature (as a proxy for thermo regulatory constraints), and rainfall
   (as a proxy for food availability), may best explain this variation.
   Findings further point to a more complex control of mouse lemur
   reproduction than previously described and illuminate phylogenetic
   constraints and adaptive potentials in behavioral reaction norms of a
   species-rich primate radiation.
   Reproductive activity of free-living populations of 12 Malagasy mouse
   lemur species varied inter- and intra-specifically. Findings suggest
   that a complex interplay between climate and phylogeny may explain
   variation in seasonal reproduction.},

Volume = {305},

Abstract = {Physical performance is crucial for animal survival and fitness. In this
   context, greater bite forces can provide advantages and may allow an
   individual to gain access to reproductive partners and/or different food
   resources. Here, we explored the determinants of bite force in a wild
   population of the brown mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus). Our objectives
   were to elucidate (1) if sex, head width, heart rate (as an indicator of
   overall physical fitness) and body condition drive variation in bite
   force in this population of wild mouse lemurs; and (2) the relative
   importance of the ecological niche in determining bite force by
   comparing results from this wild population with previously published
   results on bite force, body mass and head width from a laboratory colony
   of the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). We captured 32 wild brown
   mouse lemurs at night in the Ranomafana National Park in Madagascar
   during the beginning of the rainy season from 1st to 31st October 2016.
   We measured bite force, heart rate, body mass and head width of all
   individuals, and assigned sex and body condition (estimated as the
   unstandardized residual of a regression of body mass against head size).
   Although maximum bite force was positively correlated with body mass, it
   was not correlated with body condition. Residual bite force was highly
   correlated with residual head width and heart rate. The mean bite force
   of wild brown mouse lemurs was much lower than that of grey mouse lemurs
   in captivity, but showed similar relationships to head dimension and
   body mass. Even when corrected by body condition, grey mouse lemurs bit
   significantly harder than brown mouse lemurs. The difference in bite
   force between species could be explained by differences in head size and
   niche divergence with brown mouse lemurs eating mostly soft fruits and
   grey mouse lemurs eating more hard insects.},

Abstract = {The adult brain contains niches of neural stem cells that continuously
   add new neurons to selected circuits throughout life. Two niches have
   been extensively studied in various mammalian species including humans,
   the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular
   zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Recently, studies conducted
   mainly in rodents have identified a third neurogenic niche in the adult
   hypothalamus. In order to evaluate whether a neural stem cell niche also
   exists in the adult hypothalamus in humans, we performed multiple
   immunofluorescence labeling to assess the expression of a panel of
   neural stem/progenitor cell (NPC) markers (Sox2, nestin, vimentin,
   GLAST, GFAP) in the human hypothalamus and compared them with the mouse,
   rat and a non-human primate species, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus
   murinus). Our results show that the adult human hypothalamus contains
   four distinct populations of cells that express the five NPC markers:
   (a) a ribbon of small stellate cells that lines the third ventricular
   wall behind a hypocellular gap, similar to that found along the lateral
   ventricles, (b) ependymal cells, (c) tanycytes, which line the floor of
   the third ventricle in the tuberal region, and (d) a population of small
   stellate cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In the mouse, rat and
   mouse lemur hypothalamus, co-expression of NPC markers is primarily
   restricted to tanycytes, and these species lack a ventricular ribbon.
   Our work thus identifies four cell populations with the antigenic
   profile of NPCs in the adult human hypothalamus, of which three appear
   specific to humans.},

Abstract = {Needle-clawed galagos (Euoticus spp.) and fork-marked dwarf lemurs
   (Phaner spp.) are specialist gummivores inhabiting the forests of
   Cameroon and Madagascar, respectively. They share a suite of adaptations
   related to their foraging behavior, but are distantly related. I
   compared structural characteristics of the natural vegetation in which
   these strepsirrhines occurred using 10mx10m (100m(2)) quadrats
   established in forest areas selected on the grounds of observations of
   animals during nocturnal surveys. I established a total of 27 quadrats
   (13 in Madagascar and 14 in Cameroon). In each quadrat, trees
   potentially used by the animals (i.e., with a circumference at breast
   height 10cm) were assessed for diameter at breast height (DBH), total
   height, and maximum crown diameter (MCD) as well as tree density. The
   nature of the bark, and presence of exudates and flowers were also
   assessed, together with habitat characteristics such as percentage
   canopy cover and herbaceous cover. Primary and secondary forest types
   studied in Madagascar showed significant differences in DBH, MCD, and
   tree density, whereas only tree density was significantly different for
   the two forest types in Cameroon. Most of the trees in the quadrats had
   rough bark, but few had either exudates or flowers. Both Phaner and
   Euoticus show some degree of plasticity in their use of both primary and
   secondary forests, although they specialize in habitats with tall, large
   diameter trees. They can adjust to using trees in human modified
   habitats. Both taxa can survive in areas where a reasonably continuous
   canopy is not lacking.},

Title = {High frequency/ultrasonic communication in a critically endangered
   nocturnal primate, Claire's mouse lemur (Microcebus mamiratra)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {80},

Abstract = {The critically endangered Claire's mouse lemur, only found in the
   evergreen rain forest of the National Park Lokobe (LNP) and a few
   lowland evergreen rain forest fragments of northern Madagascar, was
   described recently. The present study provides the first quantified
   information on vocal acoustics of calls, sound associated behavioral
   context, acoustic niche, and vocal activity of this species. We recorded
   vocal and social behavior of six male-female and six male-male dyads in
   a standardized social-encounter paradigm in June and July 2016 at the
   LNP, Nosy Be island. Over six successive nights per dyad, we audio
   recorded and observed behaviors for 3hr at the beginning of the activity
   period. Based on the visual inspection of spectrograms and standardized
   multiparametric sound analysis, we identified seven different call
   types. Call types can be discriminated based on a combination of
   harmonicity, fundamental frequency variation, call duration, and degree
   of tonality. Acoustic features of tonal call types showed that for
   communication, mouse lemurs use the cryptic, high frequency/ultrasonic
   frequency niche. Two call types, the Tsak and the Grunt call, were
   emitted most frequently. Significant differences in vocal activity of
   the Tsak call were found between male-female and male-male dyads, linked
   primarily to agonistic conflicts. Dominant mouse lemurs vocalized more
   than subdominant ones, suggesting that signaling may present an honest
   indicator of fitness. A comparison of our findings of the Claire's mouse
   lemur with published findings of five bioacoustically studied mouse
   lemur species points to the notion that a complex interplay between
   ecology, predation pressure, and phylogenetic relatedness may shape the
   evolution of acoustic divergence between species in this smallest-bodied
   primate radiation. Thus, comparative bioacoustic studies, using
   standardized procedures, are promising to unravel the role of
   vocalization for primate species diversity and evolution and for
   identifying candidates for vocalization-based non-invasive monitoring
   for conservation purposes.},

Abstract = {The gaits of the adult grey mouse lemur Microcebus murinus were studied
   during treadmill locomotion over a large range of velocities. The
   locomotion sequences were analysed to determine the gait and the various
   spatiotemporal gait parameters of the limbs. We found that velocity
   adjustments are accounted for differently by stride frequency and stride
   length depending on whether the animal showed a symmetrical or an
   asymmetrical gait. When using symmetrical gaits the increase in velocity
   is associated with a constant contribution of the stride length and
   stride frequency; the increase of the stride frequency being always
   lower. When using asymmetrical gaits, the increase in velocity is mainly
   assured by an increase in the stride length which tends to decrease with
   increasing velocity. A reduction in both stance time and swing time
   contributed to the increase in stride frequency for both gaits, though
   with a major contribution from the decrease in stance time. The pattern
   of locomotion obtained in a normal young adult mouse lemurs can be used
   as a template for studying locomotor control deficits during aging or in
   different environments such as arboreal ones which likely modify the
   kinematics of locomotion.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbances have resulted in declines of seed-dispersing
   primate frugivores in tropical forests. Previous work has suggested that
   loss of seed dispersal by large frugivores may have a negative impact on
   ecosystem carbon storage by reducing tree biomass. However, we know
   little about the potential impacts of losing frugivores in Madagascar's
   diverse rainforest ecosystem. Understanding the effects of frugivore
   extinction on carbon loss is relevant in Madagascar, where threatened
   lemur taxa are the only dispersers of many large-seeded plant species.
   Using a dataset of tree species composition and traits from the
   southeastern rainforests of Ranomafana National Park, we examined
   whether seed size and lemur-dependent dispersal are positively
   associated with above-ground tree biomass. We then simulated different
   scenarios of population declines of large-seeded trees (>10mm seed
   length) dependent on lemur-mediated seed dispersal, to examine potential
   directional changes in carbon storage capacity of Malagasy forests under
   lemur loss. Lemur-dispersed tree species, which have large seeds, had
   higher above-ground biomass than other species. Our simulations showed
   that the loss of large frugivorous primates in Madagascar may decrease
   the forest's potential to store carbon. These results demonstrate the
   importance of primate conservation for maintaining functioning
   ecosystems and forest carbon stocks in one of the world's hottest
   hotspots of biodiversity.},

Title = {Predictions of Seed Shadows Generated by Common Brown Lemurs (Eulemur
   fulvus) and Their Relationship to Seasonal Behavioral Strategies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3, SI},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Frugivorous primates in the family Lemuridae, the largest seed
   dispersers in Madagascar, often modify their behavior dramatically to
   cope with seasonal fluctuations in food availability and climate. Such
   behavioral strategies influence seed dispersal distances and seed
   shadows, which determine seed fate, gene flow, and the geographical
   range expansion of plant populations. To examine seasonal variation in
   seed shadows generated by the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus), I
   combined data on movements of a wild group of lemurs in northwestern
   Madagascar from full-day observations made twice weekly for 1year and
   full-night observations made once a fortnight during the dry season,
   with gut passage times for three captive individuals in a Malagasy zoo.
   During the rainy season, brown lemurs increased traveling effort (mean
   daily path lengths: 1172 +/- SE 59m), adopting a high-cost/high-yield
   foraging strategy to maximize harvest under periods of fruit abundance;
   this resulted in long seed dispersal distances (median: 170 +/- MAD
   77m). During the dry season, daily path lengths (mean: 469 +/- SE 30m)
   were shorter owing to midday resting and consumption of water-rich
   succulent leaves, probably to avoid overheating and dehydration. These
   behaviors led to short-distance seed dispersal (median: 75 +/- MAD 47m).
   Although brown lemurs moved nocturnally during the dry season (mean
   nightly path lengths: 304 +/- SE 58m), nocturnal seed dispersal
   distances were short (median: 34 +/- MAD 21m). This seasonal variation
   in seed shadows might cause different population dynamics for rainy- and
   dry-season-fruiting species of large-seeded plants that depend on brown
   lemurs for seed dispersal. Additionally, lemur-facilitated seed
   dispersal distances were shorter than those of large frugivores
   elsewhere in the world. Therefore, lemur-mediated seed dispersal systems
   are likely to be vulnerable to forest fragmentation, which can isolate
   new recruits and prevent gene flow among plant metapopulations.},

Journal = {MOLECULAR BRAIN},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {Neurodegenerative disorders are frequent, incurable diseases
   characterised by abnormal protein accumulation and progressive neuronal
   loss. Despite their growing prevalence, the underlying pathomechanism
   remains unclear. Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) is a member of a
   transmembrane serine/threonine-protein kinase family. Although it was
   described more than a decade ago, our knowledge on LMTK2's biological
   functions is still insufficient. Recent evidence has suggested that
   LMTK2 is implicated in neurodegeneration. After reviewing the
   literature, we identified three LMTK2-mediated mechanisms which may
   contribute to neurodegenerative processes: disrupted axonal transport,
   tau hyperphosphorylation and enhanced apoptosis. Moreover, LMTK2 gene
   expression is decreased in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. According
   to these features, LMTK2 might be a promising therapeutic target in near
   future. However, further investigations are required to clarify the
   exact biological functions of this unique protein.},

Title = {Gaudalges averianovi sp nov (Acariformes: Psoroptidae)-a new parasite of

Abstract = {The psoroptid subfamily Makialginae (Acari: Psoroptidae) includes six
   genera and 11 species (Bochkov \& OConnor 2006; Bochkov et al. 2010).
   All of them are permanent, highly specialized ectoparasites of
   strepsirrhine primates (Primates: Strepsirrhini) (Bochkov et al. 2011).
   Among them the genus GaudalgesFain, 1963 includes four species
   associated with Malagasy lemurs of the families Indriidae and Lemuridae
   (Bochkov \& OConnor 2006). In this work, I describe a new species
   Gaudalges averianovi sp. nov. from Malagasy lemur Lepidolemur
   ruficaudatus Grandidier (Primates: Lepilemuridae) and provide a key to
   all known species of the genus. This is the first finding of mites of
   the genus Gaudalges on lemurs of the family Lepilemuridae.
   Mites were mounted on slides in Hoyer medium. Drawings of mites were
   made with a Leica microscope equipped with Nomarsky contrast and a
   camera lucida. In the descriptions below, idiosomal chaetotaxy follows
   Griffiths et al. (1990) with modifications of Norton (1998) for coxal
   setae. Leg chaetotaxy follows Grandjean (1941). All measurements in
   descriptions and the key are given in micrometres (mu m) and were taken
   as follows: body length, the total length from the palpal extremities to
   the posterior margin of the body; body width, maximum width taken at
   whatever level it occurs. Host systematics follows Groves (2005).},

Abstract = {Between August and October 2015, we found five carcasses of the wild
   Malayan flying lemurs (Galeopterus variegatus) in the Pangandaran Nature
   Reserve in West Java, Indonesia. Such short-term mortality events have
   never been reported for this species. In order to address the potential
   factors causing it, we firstly compared the estimated population density
   of the flying lemurs before and after the mortality events. Secondary we
   collected data on temperature, monthly rainfall, and food availability
   (in terms of phonology scores), from which we extracted unique
   feature(s) when the mortality events occurred. Mean (+/- SD) population
   size within the study site (38 ha) was 27 +/- 24, and the five carcasses
   accounted for 10-20\% of the population. The availability of young
   leaves, monthly rainfall, and maximum temperature were significantly
   lower during mortality events than in other years. The rainfall was the
   lowest in the past ten years. This suggests that drought accompanied by
   food scarcity likely causes the mortality. However, other potential
   underlying causes such as epidemics and the recent development of a
   resort near the study site cannot be ruled out. After the mortality
   events, the population size started to recover.},

Abstract = {The microbiota of the mammalian gut is a complex ecosystem, the
   composition of which is greatly influenced by host genetics and
   environmental factors. In this study, we aim to investigate the
   influence of occupancy (a geographical area of habitation), species, age
   and sex on intestinal microbiota composition of the three lemur species:
   Eulemur fulvus, E. rubriventer and E. rufifrons. Faecal samples were
   collected from a total of 138 wild lemurs across Madagascar, and
   microbial composition was determined using next-generation sequencing of
   PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments. Consistent with reports from
   other primate species, the predominant phyla were Firmicutes (43 +/-
   6.4\% {[}s.d.]) and Bacteroidetes (30.3 +/- 5.3\%). The microbial
   composition was strongly associated with occupancy in the E. fulvus
   population, with up to 19.9\% of the total variation in microbial
   composition being explained by this factor. In turn, geographical
   differences observed in faecal microbiota of sympatric lemur species
   were less pronounced, as was the impact of the factors sex and age. Our
   findings showed that among the studied factors occupancy had the
   strongest influence on intestinal microbiota of congeneric lemur
   species. This suggests adaptation of microbiota to differences in forest
   composition, climate variations and correspondingly available diet in
   different geographical locations of Madagascar.},

Title = {The effect of extreme weather events on hair cortisol and body weight in
   a wild ring-tailed lemur population (Lemur catta) in southwestern
   Madagascar},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {80},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Madagascar is known for its hypervariable climate with periodic droughts
   and cyclones, but little is known of the impact of such events on lemur
   physiology. We examined the effects of sequential weather periods,
   drought, normal, cyclone and post-cyclone, on hair cortisol
   concentrations (HCC) and body weight in wild ring-tailed lemurs, Lemur
   catta (n=185), at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve in southwestern
   Madagascar. Data were modeled and analyzed by sex, age, and troop. Given
   the ecological consequences of extreme climatic perturbations, we
   hypothesized that drought and cyclone would significantly impact lemur
   HCC. Among adults, drought was associated with higher HCC than other
   periods and the lowest HCC was associated with the post-cyclone period.
   Adult females had greater variation in HCC during drought and males had
   greater variation during cyclone and Post-cyclone periods, suggesting
   sexes were differentially affected in terms of how individuals responded
   to extreme weather events. Low HCC in the post-cyclone period followed a
   12-month period of reduced availability of primary and fallback food
   resources. Based on the known extreme and chronic nutritional stress
   during this time, our results indicate hypocortisolism in the animals
   included in our analysis. Higher HCC in sub-adults during the cyclone
   also suggests that immature lemurs may experience extreme weather events
   differently than adults. Body weight, used as a gauge for environmental
   stress, was lowest during the post-cyclone for sub-adults, young adults,
   and adults. Body weight did not differ by sex among adults across any of
   the weather events. Overall, ring-tailed lemur's HCC appear to be more
   immediately impacted by drought, or stressors associated with that
   specific weather event, and influenced by the long-term impact of
   cyclones on resource availability evidenced by data from the
   post-cyclone period.},

Abstract = {Phylogeographic barriers, together with habitat loss and fragmentation,
   contribute to the evolution of a species' genetic diversity by limiting
   gene flow and increasing genetic differentiation among populations.
   Changes in connectivity can thus affect the genetic diversity of
   populations, which may influence the evolutionary potential of species
   and the survival of populations in the long term. We studied the genetic
   diversity of the little known Northern rufous mouse lemur (Microcebus
   tavaratra), endemic to Northern Madagascar. We focused on the population
   of M. tavaratra in the Loky-Manambato region, Northern Madagascar, a
   region delimited by two permanent rivers and characterized by a mosaic
   of fragmented forests. We genotyped 148 individuals at three
   mitochondrial loci (D-loop, cytb, and cox2) in all the major forests of
   the study region. Our analyses suggest that M. tavaratra holds average
   genetic diversity when compared to other mouse lemur species, and we
   identified two to four genetic clusters in the study region, a pattern
   similar to that observed in another lemur endemic to the region
   (Propithecus tattersalli). The main cluster involved samples from the
   two mountain forests in the study region, which were connected until
   recently. However, the river crossing the study region does not appear
   to be a strict barrier to gene flow in M. tavaratra. Finally, the
   inferred demographic history of M. tavaratra suggests no detectable
   departure from stationarity over the last millennia. Comparisons with
   codistributed species (P. tattersalli and two endemic rodents, Eliurus
   spp.) suggest both differences and similarities in the genetic clusters
   identified (i.e., barriers to species dispersal) and in the inferred
   demographic history. These comparisons suggest that studies of
   codistributed species are important to understand the effects of
   landscape features on species and to reconstruct the history of habitat
   changes in a region.},

Title = {Metabolic and genomic adaptations to winter fattening in a primate
   species, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {221-230},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {AIM: To understand the mechanisms underlying the development of
   metabolic changes leading to obesity remains a major world health issue.
   Among such mechanisms, seasonality is quite underestimated although it
   corresponds to the manifestation of extreme metabolic flexibility in
   response to a changing environment. Nevertheless, the changes induced by
   such flexibility are far to be understood, especially at the level of
   insulin signaling, genomic stability or inflammation.
   METHODS: Here, we investigated the metabolic regulations displayed by a
   seasonal primate species, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) that
   exhibits pronounced changes in body mass during the 6-month winter
   season: a fattening period followed by a spontaneous fat loss, without
   ever reaching pathological stages.
   RESULTS: Such body weight modulations result from a combination of
   behavioral (food intake) and physiological (endocrine changes, switch
   between carb and lipid oxidation) adjustments that spontaneously operate
   during winter. Conversely to classical models of obesity, insulin
   sensitivity is paradoxically preserved during the obesogenic phase. Fat
   loss is associated with increased metabolic activity, especially in
   brown adipose tissue, and induced increased oxidative stress associated
   with telomere length dynamic. Furthermore, liver gene expression
   analysis revealed regulations in metabolic homeostasis (beta-oxidation,
   insulin signaling, cholesterol and lipid metabolism) but not for genes
   involved in inflammatory process (for example, Ifng, Tnf, Nfkb1).
   CONCLUSION: Altogether, these results show that mouse lemurs undergo
   deep physiological and genomic seasonal changes, without ever reaching a
   pathological stage. Further investigation is needed to decipher the
   underlying mechanisms, which may well be highly relevant for human
   therapeutic strategies.},

Title = {Entamoeba histolytica infection in wild lemurs associated with proximity
   to humans},
Journal = {VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {249},
Pages = {98-101},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Amoebiasis, caused by Entamoeba histolytica, affects 50 million people
   worldwide, and results in 100,000 deaths annually. It is particularly
   prevalent in developing nations where poverty and poor sanitation
   contribute to contamination of food and water. E. histolytica is also a
   zoonotic protozoan parasite with the potential to infect non-human
   primates. Lemurs, primates endemic to Madagascar, are the most
   threatened mammalian group in the world due to habitat loss. As forests
   disappear, humans and lemurs come into more frequent contact, and the
   potential for E. histolytica to infect lemurs intensifies. Consequently,
   we screened 176 fecal samples from seven lemur species at eight sites in
   the rain forests of southeastern Madagascar for E. histolytica to
   determine if human proximity influenced lemur infection. Of samples
   examined, 4.0\% (from three lemur species) were positive for E.
   histolytica. Of lemurs infected with E. histolytica, three (43\%)
   exhibited diarrheal feces. Distance to human settlements explained the
   variation in E. histolytica infection seen in lemurs. These results
   provide the first evidence of E. histolytica in wild lemurs and
   highlight the need for additional work to better understand the
   eco-epidemiology of this potential threat to these species.},

Title = {Does the grey mouse lemur use agonistic vocalisations to recognise kin?},
Journal = {CONTRIBUTIONS TO ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {87},
Number = {4},
Pages = {261-274},
Abstract = {Frequent kin-biased coalitionary behaviour is a hallmark of mammalian
   social complexity. Furthermore, selection to understand complex social
   dynamics is believed to underlie the co-evolution of social complexity
   and large brains. Vocalisations have been shown to be an important
   mechanism with which large-brained mammals living in complex social
   groups recognise and recruit kin for coalitionary support during
   agonistic conflicts. We test whether kin recognition via agonistic calls
   occurs in a small-brained solitary foraging primate living in a
   dispersed social network, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus,
   Miller JF, 1777). As mouse lemurs are frequent models for ancestral
   solitary foraging mammals, this study examines whether kin recognition
   via agonistic calls could be the foundation from which more complex,
   kin-based coalitionary behaviour evolved. We test whether female wild
   mouse lemurs in Ankarafantsika National Park, Madagascar, react
   differently to agonistic calls from kin and nonkin and to calls from
   familiar and unfamiliar individuals during playback experiments.
   Subjects showed no significant differences in reactions to the different
   stimuli; thus they did not react differently based upon kinship or
   familiarity. Results suggest that this solitary foraging species does
   not use agonistic calls to recognise kin and monitor agonistic
   interactions involving kin, unlike several species of Old World monkeys
   and hyenas. Thus, kin recognition via agonistic calls may have evolved
   independently in these lineages in parallel with greater social
   complexity and frequent coalitionary behaviour.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},

Volume = {1},
Abstract = {The health benefits of chronic caloric restriction resulting in lifespan
   extension are well established in many short-lived species, but the
   effects in humans and other primates remain controversial. Here we
   report the most advanced survival data and the associated follow-up to
   our knowledge of age-related alterations in a cohort of grey mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus murinus, lemurid primate) exposed to a chronic
   moderate (30\%) caloric restriction. Compared to control animals,
   caloric restriction extended lifespan by 50\% (from 6.4 to 9.6 years,
   median survival), reduced aging-associated diseases and preserved loss
   of brain white matter in several brain regions. However, caloric
   restriction accelerated loss of grey matter throughout much of the
   cerebrum. Cognitive and behavioural performances were, however, not
   modulated by caloric restriction. Thus chronic moderate caloric
   restriction can extend lifespan and enhance health of a primate, but it
   affects brain grey matter integrity without affecting cognitive
   performances.},

Title = {Grunt to goVocal coordination of group movements in redfronted lemurs},
Journal = {ETHOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {123},
Number = {12},
Pages = {894-905},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {To remain cohesive as a group, individuals must coordinate their
   movements between resources. In many species, vocalisations are used in
   this context. While some species have specific movement calls, others
   use calls which are also employed in different contexts. The use of such
   multicontextual calls has rarely been studied quantitatively, especially
   during both the pre-departure and departure period associated with
   collective decisions. We thus investigated the use of close calls
   (grunts) for the coordination of collective movements in four groups of
   wild redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) in Kirindy Forest, Western
   Madagascar. Group movements are started by an initiator, who moves away
   from the group and is joined by followers setting out in the same
   direction. We observed collective movements and recorded vocalisations
   from 18 focal individuals (54 movements recorded for followers, 21 for
   initiators). The grunt rate of both initiators and followers was higher
   in the pre-departure period than in a control context (i.e., during
   foraging). Initiators of collective movements grunted more often than
   followers in the pre-departure period as well as at individual
   departure. The latter difference was due to the initiators' grunt rates
   increasing earlier than the followers' and remaining at an elevated
   level for longer. These observations suggest that grunts serve to
   coordinate the departure by indicating the individual's readiness to
   move. The pre-departure period, in which both initiators and followers
   showed an elevated grunt rate, may provide the basis for a shared
   decision on departure time. The difference in initiator and follower
   call rates suggests that grunts may have a recruitment function, but
   playback experiments are required to test this potential function.
   Overall, our study describes how multicontextual close calls can
   function as movement calls, with changes in call rate providing a
   potential feedback mechanism for the timing of group movements. This
   study thus contributes to a more detailed understanding of the
   mechanisms of group coordination and collective decision-making.},

Title = {Aggression and hormones are associated with heterogeneity in parasitism
   and parasite dynamics in the brown mouse lemur},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {132},
Pages = {109-119},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Animal behaviours, like aggression, can directly affect host health by
   influencing exposure to parasites. Aggressive individuals may experience
   an increase in agonistic interactions and contact rates with
   conspecifics, which might increase their probability of acquiring
   parasites. However, aggression is not the only factor that shapes
   parasitism; proximate mechanisms like hormone-modulated
   immunosuppression can also have broad impacts. Here, we hypothesized
   that high levels of aggression, cortisol and testosterone would be
   positively associated with parasitism and that aggressive individuals
   would play a larger role spreading parasites to conspecifics than would
   docile individuals. We measured aggression using the level of aggressive
   response to human handling during capture. Our aim was to examine
   associations between aggression and hormones (cortisol and testosterone)
   on variation in endo-and ectoparasitism in a population of wild mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus rufus) over a 3-year period. By tracking the movement
   of lice (directly transmitted parasites) in the population, we also
   examined the effect of host aggression on population-wide parasite
   dynamics. We show that animals with high testosterone and cortisol were
   more likely to exhibit aggressive behaviours, and cortisol was
   associated with significantly higher ectoparasite infestations.
   Aggressive individuals were significantly more infested by lice, and
   also donated significantly more lice to conspecifics in the population.
   Taken together, our results offer insight into the individual and
   population health costs of aggression, and empirical support of a
   trade-off between aggression and ectoparasitism, which may have driven
   the evolution of aggression and interactions with conspecifics. (C) 2017

Abstract = {The development of novel therapeutics to prevent cognitive decline of
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is facing paramount difficulties since the
   translational efficacy of rodent models did not resulted in better
   clinical results. Currently approved treatments, including the
   acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil (DON) and the
   N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist memantine (MEM) provide marginal
   therapeutic benefits to AD patients. There is an urgent need to develop
   a predictive animal model that is phylogenetically proximal to humans to
   achieve better translation. The non-human primate grey mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus) is increasingly used in aging research, but there
   is no published results related to the impact of known pharmacological
   treatments on age-related cognitive impairment observed in this primate.
   In the present study we investigated the effects of DON and MEM on
   sleep-deprivation (SD)-induced memory impairment in young and aged male
   mouse lemurs. In particular, spatial memory impairment was evaluated
   using a circular platform task after 8 h of total SD. Acute single doses
   of DON or MEM (0.1 and 1mg/kg) or vehicle were administered
   intraperitoneally 3 h before the cognitive task during the SD procedure.
   Results indicated that both doses of DON were able to prevent the
   SD-induced deficits in retrieval of spatial memory as compared to
   vehicle-treated animals, both in young and aged animals Likewise, MEM
   show a similar profile at 1 mg/kg but not at 0.1mg/kg. Taken together,
   these results indicate that two widely used drugs for mitigating
   cognitive deficits in AD were partially effective in sleep deprived
   mouse lemurs, which further support the translational potential of this
   animal model. Our findings demonstrate the utility of this primate model
   for further testing cognitive enhancing drugs in development for AD or
   other neuropsychiatric conditions.},

Title = {Vocal greeting during mother-infant reunions in a nocturnal primate, the
   gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus)},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 4},
Abstract = {In human societies, ritualized greeting behavior includes gestural and
   vocal displays to signal the social acceptance of an encountering
   person. These displays are universal across cultures suggesting a
   pre-human origin. Vocal greeting displays are only reported for monkeys
   and apes with complex social systems, but none of these studies
   confirmed that greeting signals fulfill all criteria characterizing
   human greeting behavior. In this study, we analyzed for the first time
   whether vocal exchanges between mother and infants in a non-human
   primate fulfill the criteria of human greeting behavior and whether
   vocal greeting behavior is present in a basal primate with a less
   complex social system, the gray mouse lemur. By comparing spontaneous
   leave-takings and reunions, we found that vocal exchanges during
   mother-infant reunions fulfilled all six criteria characterizing human
   greeting behavior. Thus, predictable reciprocal vocal exchanges occurred
   at the start of the reunion (but not during leave-taking), when mother
   and infant had visual contact to each other. Thus, we argued that
   mother-infant vocal exchanges governing reunions are essential to
   establish social bonds and to ritualize the greeting function. Our
   findings suggest that ritualized vocal greeting has its origins deeply
   rooted in mammalian phylogeny and derives from vocal exchanges during
   parent-infant reunions.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {The reddish-gray mouse lemur (Microcebus griseorufus) possesses striking
   phenotypic and behavioral variation. This project investigates
   differences in autopod proportions in neighboring populations of M.
   griseorufus from the Special Reserve at Beza Mahafaly in southwest
   Madagascar. One population resides in an environment generally preferred
   by M. griseorufus-a spiny forest with large-trunked trees,
   vertically-oriented supports, and more open ground, while the other
   resides in a gallery forest with abundant small, often horizontal
   peripheral branches in high canopy. We demonstrate significant
   interpopulation differences in autopod morphophology despite no evidence
   of divergence in mitochondrial cytochrome b. We test two hypotheses
   regarding ultimate causation. The first, based on the Fine Branch
   Arborealism Hypothesis (FBAH), holds that autopod differences are
   related to different locomotor practices in the two environments, and
   the second, based on the Narrow Niche Hypothesis (NNH), holds that the
   observed differences reflect a relaxation (from ancestral to descendant
   conditions) of selective pressure for terrestrial locomotion and/or use
   of large, vertical supports combined with positive selection for
   locomoting in peripheral branch settings. Our data conform well to FBAH
   expectations and show some support for the NNH. Individuals from the
   gallery forest possess disproportionally long posterior digits that
   facilitate locomotion on small, flexible canopy supports while
   individuals from the spiny forest possess shorter posterior digits and a
   longer pollex/hallux that increase functional grasping diameter for
   large vertical supports and facilitate efficient ground locomotion.
   Focal individual data confirm differences in how often individuals
   descend to the ground and use vertical supports. We further show that
   predispersal juveniles, like adults, possess autopod morphologies suited
   to their natal forest. We explore two proximate mechanisms that could
   generate these cheiridial differences. The first posits an in vivo
   plastic response to different locomotor behaviors, the second posits
   differences that manifest in early development.},

Abstract = {Geographic patterns of biodiversity result from broad-scale
   biogeographic and present-day ecological processes. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the relative importance of biogeographic
   history and ecology driving patterns of diversity in modern primate
   communities in Madagascar. I collected data on endemic lemur species
   co-occurrence from range maps and survey literature for 100 communities
   in protected areas. I quantified and compared taxonomic, phylogenetic,
   and functional dimensions of intra- and intersite diversity. I tested
   environmental and geographic predictors of diversity and endemism. I
   calculated deforestation rates within protected areas between the years
   2000 and 2014, and tested if diversity is related to forest cover and
   loss. I found the phylogenetic structure of lemur communities could be
   explained primarily by remotely sensed plant productivity, supporting
   the hypothesis that there was ecological differentiation among
   ecoregions, while functional-trait disparity was not strongly related to
   environment. Taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity also increased with
   increasing topographic heterogeneity. Beta diversity was explained by
   both differences in ecology among localities and potential river
   barriers. Approximately 3000 km(2) were deforested in protected areas
   since the year 2000, threatening the most diverse communities (up to
   31\%/park). The strong positive association of plant productivity and
   topographic heterogeneity with lemur diversity indicates that high
   productivity, rugged landscapes support greater diversity. Both ecology
   and river barriers influenced lemur community ecology and biogeography.
   These results underscore the need for focused conservation efforts to
   slow the loss of irreplaceable evolutionary and ecological diversity.},

Title = {Of lemurs and louse flies: The biogeochemical and biotic effects of
   forest disturbance on Propithecus edwardsi and its obligate ectoparasite
   Allobosca crassipes in Ranomafana National Park, southeastern Madagascar},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {From alleles to ecosystems and landscapes, anthropogenic activity
   continues to affect the environment, with particularly adverse effects
   on biodiversity hotspots such as Madagascar. Selective logging has been
   proposed as a win-win conservation strategy, yet its effects on
   different components of biodiversity are still not fully understood.
   Here we examine biotic factors (i.e., dietary differences) that may be
   driving differences in biogeochemical stocks between disturbed and
   undisturbed forests. We present the stable nitrogen (delta N-15) and
   carbon (delta C-13) isotope composition of hair from the lemur
   Propithecus edwardsi and of whole bodies of its obligate ectoparasite,
   the louse-fly Allobosca crassipes, from sites in Ranomafana National
   Park (RNP) that are comparable except for the history of logging and
   subsequent forest regeneration. P. edwardsi and A. crassipes from the
   disturbed (i.e., heavily selectively logged) site are lower in N-15 and
   C-13 relative to P. edwardsi and A. crassipes from sites that were
   minimally selectively logged or not commercially logged at all. There is
   a similar to 3 parts per thousand decrease in N-15 between disturbed and
   undisturbed sites that corresponds to a difference of nearly a full
   trophic level. Flowers from Bakerella clavata, a staple food source for
   P. edwardsi in disturbed habitats and a fallback food for P. edwardsi in
   primary forests, were also analyzed isotopically. B. clavata is delta
   N-15-depleted in both disturbed and undisturbed sites. Data from
   longitudinal behavioral surveys of P. edwardsi in RNP and other forests
   in eastern Madagascar point to significant differences in consumption
   patterns of B. clavata, with P. edwardsi in disturbed forests consuming
   almost twice as much of this plant. Depletion of N-15 in animal tissues
   is a complex issue, but likely the result of the interaction of
   physiological and ecological factors. Anthropogenic disturbance in RNP
   from selective logging has had both biotic and biogeochemical effects
   that are observable trophically.},

Title = {A biogeographical perspective on the variation in mouse lemur density
   throughout Madagascar},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {47},
Number = {3},
Pages = {212-229},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {1. Madagascar is home to the smallest primates in the world, the mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus species). Twenty- four species of mouse lemur are
   currently recognised and are found in variable ecosystems, from dry
   forests and spiny deserts to humid forests. Due to their widespread
   distribution and the large number of sympatric species, mouse lemurs can
   be used as a model to understand the linkages among species richness,
   population density, and habitat. As all lemurs are threatened by habitat
   loss and fragmentation, this information can also be used to inform
   conservation management.
   2. We hypothesise that on an island- wide scale, we will find higher
   population densities in western dry forests than in eastern humid
   forests because the western dry forests exhibit lower species richness,
   more sympatric habitat use, and lower resource stability than the
   eastern humid forests.
   3. We conducted a literature review of population density estimates of
   known mouse lemur species, and used those data to conduct a meta-
   analysis and estimate overall average population density by geographic
   region.
   4. Our findings suggest that mouse lemur species living in western dry
   forest generally exhibit higher densities than those in eastern humid
   forests. This may be partly explained by higher habitat fragmentation in
   western dry forests, where species co- occur, but is likely to be a
   function of the magnitude and variability in seasonally available
   resources in each forest type. Higher seasonality results in less
   constant food availability and lower levels of environmental
   predictability, fostering species capable of coping with environmental
   change and maintaining high densities throughout periods of resource
   paucity.
   5. Our study highlights the importance of conducting Microcebus
   population density research that adheres to standardised methodological
   approaches. We point to the need for population density estimates for
   several species for which data are lacking. Such knowledge is important
   to assess the conservation status of these species, but also to enhance
   our ability to identify the macro-biogeographical and local ecological
   drivers of interspecific and intraspecific variability in population
   density.},

Abstract = {Our understanding of the taxonomic limits and biogeographical evolution
   of the Afro-Madagascan genus Delonix and the closely related
   monospecific Madagascan endemic genera Colvillea and Lemuropisum have
   been hampered by unresolved intergeneric and interspecific
   relationships. Here we study the phylogenetics of the group using
   nucleotide sequences from ribosomal ITS, four low-copy nuclear genes and
   four plastid regions. We find poorly resolved gene trees typical of
   closely related species, but most species are resolved as monophyletic,
   and we report conflicting phylogenetic placements only for D.
   brachycarpa and C. racemosa. A time-calibrated biogeographical analysis
   of the concatenated matrix of all nine loci suggests that the ancestral
   area of the Delonix, Lemuropisum and Colvillea clade was in
   south-western Madagascar c. 24-18 Ma. An out-of-Madagascar dispersal to
   Africa took place during the Miocene, most likely by vegetative rafting.
   Delonix is not monophyletic due to the robustly supported placement of
   L. edule in Delonix, warranting treatment of Lemuropisum as congeneric
   with Delonix and establishment of the new name combination Delonix
   edule, in line with the close morphological similarities between these
   two genera. In contrast, the phylogenetic position of C. racemosa is
   unstable occurring in the Delonix-Lemuropisum clade in the nuclear gene
   trees, but sister to this clade in the plastid gene tree. The status of
   Colvillea as a distinct genus, therefore, remains questionable, but it
   is here maintained based on a suite of morphological distinctions,
   pending further insights into the relationships of this elusive genus.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe medical care currently to brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus) is
   limited by a lack of knowledge of their anatomy. The aim of this study
   was to describe the anatomy and histology and obtain ultrasonographic
   measurements of normal adrenal glands in these animals.
   MethodsThe adrenal glands of four lemurs cadavers were used for the
   anatomical and histological studies, and those of 15 anesthetized lemurs
   were examined by ultrasonography.
   ResultsAnatomically, the adrenal glands of brown lemurs are comparable
   to those of other species. The histological findings showed that the
   cortex is organized into three distinct layers, whereas most domestic
   mammals have an additional zone. The surface area of the adrenal glands
   increased with body weight, and the area of the right adrenal was
   slightly larger than the left.
   ConclusionsWe suggest using ultrasonography to aid the etiological
   diagnosis of behavioral abnormalities that might be due to dysfunctions
   of the adrenal gland.},

Journal = {CANCER LETTERS},

Abstract = {Using a high-throughput approach, we identified lemur tyrosine kinase 2
   (LMTK2) as a novel determinant of cell sensitivity to TRAIL. LMTK2 is a
   poorly characterized serine/threonine kinase believed to play a role in
   endosomal membrane trafficking and neuronal physiology, and recently
   found to be mutated in diverse tumor types. We show that LMTK2 silencing
   sensitizes immortalized epithelial cells and cancer cells to TRAIL, and
   this phenomenon is accompanied by changes in the expression of BCL2
   family members. In epithelial cells, LMTK2 targeting causes the
   down-regulation of the BCL2 and BCL-xL antiapoptotic proteins and the
   reciprocal up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM, while, in
   cancer cells, LMTK2 knock-down reduces BCL2 without increasing BIM
   levels. We provide evidence that both BIM and BCL2 proteins are
   regulated by LMTK2 in a GSK3 beta- and PP1A-dependent manner and that
   their perturbation, together with BCL-xL reduction, determines an
   increased sensitivity not only to TRAIL, but also to other compounds.
   Overall, our findings suggest a broad function of LMTK2 in the
   regulation of the apoptotic pathway and highlight LMTK2 as a novel
   candidate target to increase the cytotoxic activity of chemotherapeutic
   compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Prioritizing protected areas in Madagascar for lemur diversity using a
   multidimensional perspective},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {207},
Pages = {1-8},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Biodiversity is affected by anthropogenic activities, with a trend of
   decreasing species richness with habitat degradation. Decreasing species
   richness erodes evolutionary history and ecosystem function, but
   taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity can have contrasting
   patterns. It is essential to measure these dimensions of biodiversity
   explicitly and assess how they are valued in prioritizing protected
   areas (PAs) to conserve diversity. Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot,
   with high diversity and endemism coupled with heavy anthropogenic
   pressure. The endemic primates - lemurs - are the most endangered mammal
   taxon. A recent action plan prioritized PAs based on lemur species
   richness, weighted by endangerment. This scheme does not capture the
   evolutionary, functional, or biogeographic components of biodiversity,
   nor does it directly assess the level of human threat to those PAs. I
   compiled the largest dataset on lemur community composition in 100 PM,
   including almost all lemur species (98 species). I combined data on
   lemur occurrence, their phylogeny, functional traits, IUCN Red List
   status, and environmental variables including deforestation between the
   years 2000 and 2014. I ranked PM based on 14 metrics as well as the sum
   of metrics to determine how PA priorities compare under different
   valuation schemes. Based on the sum of seven metrics, I identified the
   top 25 PM for lemur conservation. With these priority rankings, I
   propose areas of high lemur diversity, habitat heterogeneity and
   productivity, and deforestation be the focus of future conservation
   activities to maximize community resilience and prevent the erosion of
   evolutionary diversity and ecosystem function. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Novel opsin gene variation in large-bodied, diurnal lemurs},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {` Some primate populations include both trichromatic and dichromatic
   (red-green colour blind) individuals due to allelic variation at the
   X-linked opsin locus. This polymorphic trichromacy is well described in
   day-active New World monkeys. Less is known about colour vision in
   Malagasy lemurs, but, unlike New World monkeys, only some day-active
   lemurs are polymorphic, while others are dichromatic. The evolutionary
   pressures underlying these differences in lemurs are unknown, but
   aspects of species ecology, including variation in activity pattern, are
   hypothesized to play a role. Limited data on X-linked opsin variation in
   lemurs make such hypotheses difficult to evaluate. We provide the first
   detailed examination of X-linked opsin variation across a lemur clade
   (Indriidae). We sequenced the X-linked opsin in the most strictly
   diurnal and largest extant lemur, Indri indri, and nine species of
   smaller, generally diurnal indriids (Propithecus). Although nocturnal
   Avahi (sister taxon to Propithecus) lacks a polymorphism, at least eight
   species of diurnal indriids have two or more X-linked opsin alleles.
   Four rainforest-living taxa-I. indri and the three largest Propithecus
   species-have alleles not previously documented in lemurs. Moreover, we
   identified at least three opsin alleles in Indri with peak spectral
   sensitivities similar to some New World monkeys.},

Title = {Phylogenomic Reconstruction of Sportive Lemurs (genus Lepilemur)

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HEREDITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {108},

Abstract = {The family Lepilemuridae includes 26 species of sportive lemurs, most of
   which were recently described. The cryptic morphological differences
   confounded taxonomy until recent molecular studies; however, some
   species' boundaries remain uncertain. To better understand the genus
   Lepilemur, we analyzed 35 complete mitochondrial genomes representing
   all recognized 26 sportive lemur taxa and estimated divergence dates.
   With our dataset we recovered 25 reciprocally monophyletic lineages, as
   well as an admixed clade containing Lepilemur mittermeieri and Lepilemur
   dorsalis. Using modern distribution data, an ancestral area
   reconstruction and an ecological vicariance analysis were performed to
   trace the history of diversification and to test biogeographic
   hypotheses. We estimated the initial split between the eastern and
   western Lepilemur clades to have occurred in the Miocene. Divergence of
   most species occurred from the Pliocene to the Pleistocene. The
   biogeographic patterns recovered in this study were better addressed
   with a combinatorial approach including climate, watersheds, and rivers.
   Generally, current climate and watershed hypotheses performed better for
   western and eastern clades, while speciation of northern clades was not
   adequately supported using the ecological factors incorporated in this
   study. Thus, multiple mechanisms likely contributed to the speciation
   and distribution patterns in Lepilemur.},

Title = {LemurFaceID: a face recognition system to facilitate individual
   identification of lemurs},
Journal = {BMC ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Background: Long-term research of known individuals is critical for
   understanding the demographic and evolutionary processes that influence
   natural populations. Current methods for individual identification of
   many animals include capture and tagging techniques and/or researcher
   knowledge of natural variation in individual phenotypes. These methods
   can be costly, time-consuming, and may be impractical for larger-scale,
   population-level studies. Accordingly, for many animal lineages,
   long-term research projects are often limited to only a few taxa.
   Lemurs, a mammalian lineage endemic to Madagascar, are no exception.
   Long-term data needed to address evolutionary questions are lacking for
   many species. This is, at least in part, due to difficulties collecting
   consistent data on known individuals over long periods of time. Here, we
   present a new method for individual identification of lemurs
   (LemurFaceID). LemurFaceID is a computer-assisted facial recognition
   system that can be used to identify individual lemurs based on
   photographs.
   Results: LemurFaceID was developed using patch-wise Multiscale Local
   Binary Pattern features and modified facial image normalization
   techniques to reduce the effects of facial hair and variation in ambient
   lighting on identification. We trained and tested our system using
   images from wild red-bellied lemurs (Eulemur rubriventer) collected in
   Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. Across 100 trials, with different
   partitions of training and test sets, we demonstrate that the
   LemurFaceID can achieve 98.7\% +/- 1.81\% accuracy (using 2-query image
   fusion) in correctly identifying individual lemurs.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that human facial recognition
   techniques can be modified for identification of individual lemurs based
   on variation in facial patterns. LemurFaceID was able to identify
   individual lemurs based on photographs of wild individuals with a
   relatively high degree of accuracy. This technology would remove many
   limitations of traditional methods for individual identification. Once
   optimized, our system can facilitate long-term research of known
   individuals by providing a rapid, cost-effective, and accurate method
   for individual identification.},

Title = {Population genetics of mouse lemur vomeronasal receptors: current versus
   past selection and demographic inference},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Background: A major effort is underway to use population genetic
   approaches to identify loci involved in adaptation. One issue that has
   so far received limited attention is whether loci that show a
   phylogenetic signal of positive selection in the past also show evidence
   of ongoing positive selection at the population level. We address this
   issue using vomeronasal receptors (VRs), a diverse gene family in
   mammals involved in intraspecific communication and predator detection.
   In mouse lemurs, we previously demonstrated that both subfamilies of VRs
   (V1Rs and V2Rs) show a strong signal of directional selection in
   interspecific analyses. We predicted that ongoing sexual selection
   and/or co-evolution with predators may lead to current directional or
   balancing selection on VRs. Here, we re-sequence 17 VRs and perform a
   suite of selection and demographic analyses in sympatric populations of
   two species of mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus and M. ravelobensis) in
   northwestern Madagascar.
   Results: M. ravelobensis had consistently higher genetic diversity at
   VRs than M. murinus. In general, we find little evidence for positive
   selection, with most loci evolving under purifying selection and one
   locus even showing evidence of functional loss in M. ravelobensis.
   However, a few loci in M. ravelobensis show potential evidence of
   positive selection. Using mismatch distributions and expansion models,
   we infer a more recent colonisation of the habitat by M. murinus than by
   M. ravelobensis, which most likely speciated in this region earlier on.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that the analysis of VR variation is
   useful in inferring demographic and phylogeographic history of mouse
   lemurs. In conclusion, this study reveals a substantial heterogeneity
   over time in selection on VR loci, suggesting that VR evolution is
   episodic.},

Title = {Testing the adaptive radiation hypothesis for the lemurs of Madagascar},
Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Lemurs, the diverse, endemic primates of Madagascar, are thought to
   represent a classic example of adaptive radiation. Based on the most
   complete phylogeny of living and extinct lemurs yet assembled, I tested
   predictions of adaptive radiation theory by estimating rates of
   speciation, extinction and adaptive phenotypic evolution. As predicted,
   lemur speciation rate exceeded that of their sister clade by nearly
   twofold, indicating the diversification dynamics of lemurs and mainland
   relatives may have been decoupled. Lemur diversification rates did not
   decline over time, however, as predicted by adaptive radiation theory.
   Optimal body masses diverged among dietary and activity pattern niches
   as lineages diversified into unique multidimensional ecospace. Based on
   these results, lemurs only partially fulfil the predictions of adaptive
   radiation theory, with phenotypic evolution corresponding to an `early
   burst' of adaptive differentiation. The results must be interpreted with
   caution, however, because over the long evolutionary history of lemurs
   (approx. 50 million years), the ` early burst' signal of adaptive
   radiation may have been eroded by extinction.},

Title = {Unveiling the Transient Protein-Protein Interactions that Modulate the
   Activity of Estrogen Receptor(ER)-alpha by Human Lemur Tyrosine Kinase-3
   (LMTK3) Domain: An In Silico Study},

Abstract = {Background: Estrogen receptor-alpha positive breast cancer is the most
   common dreadful disease and leading cause of death among women. In
   majority of human breast cancer, the interactions between kinases and ER
   alpha are considered to be critical in signaling pathway. Many kinases
   are known to regulate ER alpha activity. Recently Lemur tyrosine
   kinase-3 was identified as predictive oncogenic ER alpha regulator with
   a vital role in endocrine resistance. The role of LMTK3 in ERa
   regulation can be known by studying the interactions between them.
   Objectives: To understand the transient interactions between ER alpha
   and LMTK3 using computational technique.
   Method: ER alpha-LMTK3 complex structure was obtained using PatchDock
   server. The interacting residues and interface area between ERa and
   LMTK3 were identified using PDBsum. Molecular dynamics simulation was
   used to study the conformational dynamics of ER alpha-LMTK3 complex.
   Result: The approximate interface area of ER alpha-LMTK3 was found to be
   3175 angstrom(2) with atomic contact energy of 191.77 kcal/mol. PDBsum
   results revealed that some of the residues in C-terminal region of LMTK3
   displayed non-bonding interactions with the residues in the
   phosphorylation sites (Ser104 and Ser106) of ER alpha. We noticed the
   total number of interface residues in ER alpha-LMTK3 complex to be 50
   and the interface area for ER alpha as well as LMTK3 chain involved in
   interaction to be more than 2380 a2. From conformational dynamics study,
   ER alpha-LMTK3 complex structure was found to be stable.
   Conclusion: The outcomes of the current study enhance the understanding
   of interactions between ER alpha and LMTK3 which are thought to be
   critical in signaling pathway in majority of human breast cancers.},

Title = {The effect of habitat disturbance on the abundance of nocturnal lemur
   species on the Masoala Peninsula, northeastern Madagascar},

Abstract = {Madagascar is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. The island's
   past and current rates of deforestation and habitat disturbance threaten
   its plethora of endemic biodiversity. On Madagascar, tavy (slash and
   burn agriculture), land conversion for rice cultivation, illegal
   hardwood logging and bushmeat hunting are the major contributors to
   habitat disturbance. Understanding species-specific responses to habitat
   disturbance across different habitat types is crucial when designing
   conservation strategies. We surveyed three nocturnal lemur species in
   four forest types of varying habitat disturbance on the Masoala
   Peninsula, northeastern Madagascar. We present here updated abundance
   and density estimates for the Endangered Avahi mooreorum and Lepilemur
   scottorum, and Microcebus sp. Distance sampling surveys were conducted
   on 11 transects, covering a total of 33 km after repeated transect
   walks. We collected data on tree height, bole height, diameter at breast
   height, canopy cover and tree density using point-quarter sampling to
   characterise the four forest types (primary lowland, primary littoral,
   selectively logged and agricultural mosaic). Median encounter rates by
   forest type ranged from 1 to 1.5 individuals (ind.)/km (Microcebus sp.),
   0-1 ind./km (A. mooreorum) and 0-1 ind./km (L. scottorum). Species
   density estimates were calculated at 232.31 ind./km(2) (Microcebus sp.)
   and 121.21 ind./km(2) (A. mooreorum), while no density estimate is
   provided for L. scottorum due to a small sample size. Microcebus sp. was
   most tolerant to habitat disturbance, exhibiting no significant effect
   of forest type on abundance. Its small body size, omnivorous diet and
   generalised locomotion appear to allow it to tolerate a variety of
   habitat disturbance. Both A. mooreorum and L. scottorum showed
   significant effects of forest type on their respective abundance. This
   study suggests that the specialist locomotion and diet of A. mooreorum
   and L. scottorum make them susceptible to the effects of increasing
   habitat disturbance.},

Title = {Lemur Tyrosine Kinase-3 Suppresses Growth of Prostate Cancer Via the AKT

Journal = {CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY},

Abstract = {Background/Aims: Lemur tyrosine kinase (LMTK)-3 is a member of the
   receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family. Abnormal expression of LMTK-3
   exists in various types of cancers, especially in endocrine-resistant
   breast cancers; however, the precise level of expression and the
   biological function in prostate cancer are poorly understood. Methods:In
   the present study, we determined the expression of LMTK-3 in prostate
   cancer using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. We infected PC3
   and LNCaP cells with lentivirus-LMTK-3 and observed the biologic
   characteristics of the PC3 and LNCaP cells in vitro with TUNEL, and
   migration and invasion assays, respectively. We also established a
   transplant tumor model of human prostate cancer with infected cells in
   15 BALB/c-nu/nu nude mice. Results: LMTK-3 was expressed in prostate
   epithelial cells. There was a significant decline in the level of LMTK-3
   expression in prostate cancers compared to normal tissues. LMTK-3
   inhibited PC3 and LNCaP cell growth, migration, and invasion, and
   induced cell apoptosis in vitro. We also observed that LMTK-3 induced
   PC3 cell apoptosis in vivo. Further study showed that LMTK-3 inhibited
   phosphorylation of AKT and ERK, and promoted phosphorylation and
   activation of p38 kinase and Jun kinase (JNK). Conclusion: Recombinant
   lentivirus with enhanced expression of LMTK-3 inhibited prostate cancer
   cell growth and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. AKT and MAPK
   signaling pathways may contribute to the process. (C) 2017 The Author(s)

Title = {Paternity in wild ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta): Implications for
   male mating strategies},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},

Volume = {78},
Number = {12},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In group-living species with male dominance hierarchies where receptive
   periods of females do not overlap, high male reproductive skew would be
   predicted. However, the existence of female multiple mating and
   alternative male mating strategies can call into question single-male
   monopolization of paternity in groups. Ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)
   are seasonally breeding primates that live in multi-male, multi-female
   groups. Although established groups show male dominance hierarchies,
   male dominance relationships can break down during mating periods. In
   addition, females are the dominant sex and mate with multiple males
   during estrus, including group residents, and extra-group malesposing
   the question of whether there is high or low male paternity skew in
   groups. In this study, we analyzed paternity in a population of wild L.
   catta from the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve in southwestern Madagascar.
   Paternity was determined with 80-95\% confidence for 39 offspring born
   to nine different groups. We calculated male reproductive skew indices
   for six groups, and our results showed a range of values corresponding
   to both high and low reproductive skew. Between 21\% and 33\% of
   offspring (3 of 14 or three of nine, counting paternity assignments at
   the 80\% or 95\% confidence levels, respectively) were sired by
   extra-troop males. Males siring offspring within the same group during
   the same year appear to be unrelated. Our study provides evidence of
   varying male reproductive skew in different L. catta groups. A single
   male may monopolize paternity across one or more years, while in other
   groups, >1 male can sire offspring within the same group, even within a
   single year. Extra-group mating is a viable strategy that can result in
   extra-group paternity for L. catta males.},

Title = {Fission-fusion dynamics in black-and-white ruffed lemurs may facilitate
   both feeding strategies and communal care of infants in a spatially and
   temporally variable environment},

Abstract = {Species with greater expression of fission-fusion dynamics show greater
   variability in the size, composition, and cohesion of subgroups over
   time. This may allow their adjustment to local environmental, social,
   and demographic conditions. We tested which environmental and social
   factors influenced subgroup size in one such species, the
   black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata) at two sites within a
   fragmented forest landscape. Using instantaneous focal sampling at
   15-min intervals, we collected data on subgroup size and composition,
   fruit and flower availability, and location. We also collected biweekly
   data on site-wide fruit and flower availability. We used these data to
   test the influence of season, food availability, reproduction, and
   predation risk on adult subgroup size in this species. Ruffed lemur
   adults consistently formed significantly larger subgroups in times of
   lower site-wide fruit availability, during the wet season, and when one
   or more infants were present. There were differences between sites in
   the relationship between subgroup size and tree size, fruit patch size,
   and site-wide flower availability. Variables measuring indirect
   predation risk showed no significant relationship with subgroup size.
   These results emphasize the strong relationship between fission-fusion
   dynamics and spatial and temporal variation in food availability, as
   well as the importance of sociality in a species with communal care of
   infants. Fission-fusion dynamics may serve as an evolutionary strategy
   to adapt to the unpredictable and sometimes harsh environmental
   conditions of Madagascar and may facilitate the persistence of
   communities of this critically endangered lemur despite widespread
   anthropogenic habitat modification.
   Fission-fusion dynamics (the joining and separating of subgroups within
   a larger group of animals) may allow species to adjust social benefits
   to changing environmental conditions. This study examines the underlying
   ecological and social factors that might influence fission-fusion
   dynamics in black-and-white ruffed lemurs. Subgroup size in this species
   was strongly related to food availability, though not always in the
   direction expected. This suggests that the relationship between food
   availability and sociality changes when food availability reaches very
   low levels. Additionally, infant presence was linked to larger adult
   subgroups, indicating a connection between fission-fusion behavior and
   the cooperative rearing of offspring seen in this species. Relationships

Title = {Determinants of terrestrial feeding in an arboreal primate: The case of
   the southern bamboo lemur (Hapalemur meridionalis)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {161},
Number = {2},
Pages = {328-342},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objectives: The proximate and ultimate determinants that may have
   prompted some primates to shift from an arboreal to terrestrial feeding
   niche, whether due to environmental change, seasonality, and/or
   predation pressure, are poorly understood. Within a fragmented littoral
   forest in southeast Madagascar, an arboreal strepsirrhine population
   spends a large proportion of time on the ground, thus we aimed to
   identify which factors influence terrestrial feeding.
   Methods: From January to December 2013, we conducted 103 full-day focal
   follows on three social groups of southern bamboo lemurs H.
   meridionalis. We continuously recorded feeding time on all arboreal and
   terrestrial items, as well as whether the focal individual was under the
   canopy or exposed, and the distance to their nearest conspecific
   neighbor. All observed food items were collected and analyzed for
   macronutrient content. Daily climatic variables (temperature,
   precipitation), resource seasonality, daily path length (DPL), along
   with dietary and predation risk proxies, were used as fixed effects in a
   linear mixed model, with the daily proportion of terrestrial feeding as
   the dependent variable.
   Results: Our model indicated that daily terrestrial feeding increased at
   cooler temperature, was associated with reduced DPL, and the intake of
   dietary metabolizable energy increased as terrestrial feeding increased.
   All other fixed effects were not significant predictors.
   Discussion: Our study provides a window into the ultimate determinants
   of niche expansion: ancestral primates, in absence of their primary
   resources, may have initially descended to the ground in peripheral
   population range areas where the benefits (eg., nutritional pay-off)
   out-weighed the costs.},

Title = {Primate genotyping via high resolution melt analysis: rapid and reliable
   identification of color vision status in wild lemurs},
Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {57},
Number = {4},
Pages = {541-547},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Analyses of genetic polymorphisms can aid our understanding of intra-
   and interspecific variation in primate sociality, ecology, and behavior.
   Studies of primate opsin genes are prime examples of this, as single
   nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the X-linked opsin gene underlie variation
   in color vision. For primate species with polymorphic trichromacy,
   genotyping opsin SNVs can generally indicate whether individual primates
   are red-green color-blind (denoted homozygous M or homozygous L) or have
   full trichromatic color vision (heterozygous ML). Given the potential
   influence of color vision on behavior and fitness, characterizing the
   color vision status of study subjects is becoming commonplace for many
   primate field projects. Such studies traditionally involve a multi-step
   sequencing-based method that can be costly and time-consuming. Here we
   present a new reliable, rapid, and relatively inexpensive method for
   characterizing color vision in primate populations using high resolution
   melt analysis (HRMA). Using lemurs as a case study, we characterized
   variation at exons 3 and/or 5 of the X-linked opsin gene for 87
   individuals representing nine species. We scored opsin genotypes and
   color vision status using both traditional sequencing-based methods as
   well as our novel melting-curve based HRMA protocol. For each species,
   the melting curves of varying genotypes (homozygous M, homozygous L,
   heterozygous ML) differed in melting temperature and/or shape. Melting
   curves for each sample were consistent across replicates, and
   genotype-specific melting curves were consistent across DNA sources
   (blood vs. feces). We show that opsin genotypes can be quickly and
   reliably scored using HRMA once lab-specific reference curves have been
   developed based on known genotypes. Although the protocol presented here
   focuses on genotyping lemur opsin loci, we also consider the larger
   potential for applying this approach to various types of genetic studies
   of primate populations.},

Abstract = {Fruit ripeness can be indicated through changes in chromaticity,
   luminance, odor, hardness, and size to attract seed dispersing animals.
   We quantified these attributes for both ripe and unripe fruits of 31
   lemur-dispersed plant species in Ankarafantsika National Park, a
   tropical dry forest in northwestern Madagascar. We used spectroscopy,
   gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry, and a modified force gauge to
   quantify chromaticity, luminance, odor, and hardness. We compared these
   traits between unripe and ripe fruits of each species to determine which
   traits reliably indicate fruit ripeness across species. Overall, ripe
   fruits were significantly heavier and softer than unripe fruits. Ripe
   fruits were not more chromatically-conspicuous or odiferous relative to
   unripe fruits, nor were ripe fruits more conspicuous in the luminance
   channel. Contrary to expectation, our findings indicate that, in this
   particular system, plant-lemur interactions may be strongly mediated by
   haptic traits, such as fruit hardness, which are consistent and reliable
   indicators of fruit ripeness. Despite the potential importance of haptic
   indicators of fruit ripeness, they are underrepresented in the
   literature on sensory ecology.},

Title = {Coevolution of Cyanogenic Bamboos and Bamboo Lemurs on Madagascar},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 17},
Abstract = {Feeding strategies of specialist herbivores often originate from the
   coevolutionary arms race of plant defenses and counter-adaptations of
   herbivores. The interaction between bamboo lemurs and cyanogenic bamboos
   on Madagascar represents a unique system to study diffuse coevolutionary
   processes between mammalian herbivores and plant defenses. Bamboo lemurs
   have different degrees of dietary specialization while bamboos show
   different levels of chemical defense. In this study, we found variation
   in cyanogenic potential (HCNp) and nutritive characteristics among five
   sympatric bamboo species in the Ranomafana area, southeastern
   Madagascar. The HCNp ranged from 209 +/- 72 mu mol cyanide{*}g(-1) dwt
   in Cathariostachys madagascariensis to no cyanide in Bambusa
   madagascariensis. Among three sympatric bamboo lemur species, the
   greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) has the narrowest food range as it
   almost exclusively feeds on the highly cyanogenic C. madagascariensis.
   Our data suggest that high HCNp is the derived state in bamboos. The
   ancestral state of lemurs is most likely ``generalist{''} while the
   ancestral state of bamboo lemurs was determined as equivocal.
   Nevertheless, as recent bamboo lemurs comprise several ``facultative
   specialists{''} and only one ``obligate specialist{''} adaptive
   radiation due to increased flexibility is likely. We propose that
   escaping a strict food plant specialization enabled facultative
   specialist bamboo lemurs to inhabit diverse geographical areas.},

Abstract = {Adverse effects of light at night are associated with human health
   problems and with changes in seasonal reproduction in several species.
   Owing to its role in the circadian timing system, melatonin production
   is suspected to mediate excess nocturnal light. To test this hypothesis,
   we examined the effect of light pollution on the timing of seasonal
   reproduction on a strict Malagasy long-day breeder, the nocturnal mouse
   lemur (Microcebus murinus). We randomly exposed 12 males in wintering
   sexual rest to moonlight or to a light-mimicking nocturnal streetlight
   for 5 weeks. We monitored urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin concentrations
   (aMT6s), plasma testosterone concentrations, and testis size, and we
   recorded daily rhythms of core temperature and locomotor activity. In
   males exposed to light pollution, we observed a significant decrease in
   urinary aMT6s concentrations associated with changes in daily rhythm
   profiles and with activation of reproductive function. These results
   showed that males entered spontaneous sexual recrudescence leading to a
   summer acclimatization state, which suggests that light at night
   disrupts perception of day length cues, leading to an inappropriate
   photoentrainment of seasonal rhythms.},

   lemurs (Lepilemur leucopus) persist on a leaf-based diet. We
   investigated how extrinsic (i.e., seasonality in temperature and food
   availability) and intrinsic factors (i.e., reproductive state) influence
   nutrient intake and explored how nutrient and energy needs are met in
   this species.
   Materials and Methods: We conducted full night focal follows across all
   seasons and analyzed nutrients in all items eaten by adults of both
   sexes to investigate nutrient intake and nutritional priorities in L.
   leucopus. We estimated digestible protein content, as this is a
   biologically more meaningful measure than crude protein.
   Results: Protein intake was constant across seasons, while non-protein
   energy and dry matter intake increased from the hot wet to the cold dry
   season. Males and females did not differ in their nutrient or apparent
   energy intake irrespective of female reproductive state.
   Discussion: We conclude that these animals prioritize protein over
   non-protein energy intake as dietary protein is in limited supply, and
   that thermoregulation poses higher energetic costs than reproduction in
   this species. While protein intake did not differ across female
   reproductive states, the relative protein content of the diet was
   highest during the lactation period, indicating that the balance of
   non-protein to protein intake may be more important than absolute
   intake. Dry matter intake was high compared to other folivorous
   primates, indicating that L. leucopus follows an intake rather than an
   efficiency strategy to meet its energy requirements. (C) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {Despite an increasing recognition of the ecosystem services provided by
   mangroves, we know little about their role in maintaining terrestrial
   biodiversity, including primates. Madagascar's lemurs are a top global
   conservation priority, with 94 \% of species threatened with extinction,
   but records of their occurrence in mangroves are scarce. I used a
   mixed-methods approach to collect published and unpublished observations
   of lemurs in mangroves: I carried out a systematic literature search and
   supplemented this with a targeted information request to 1243
   researchers, conservation and tourism professionals, and others who may
   have visited mangroves in Madagascar. I found references to, or
   observations of, at least 23 species in 5 families using mangroves,
   representing > 20\% of lemur species and > 50\% of species whose
   distributions include mangrove areas. Lemurs used mangroves for
   foraging, sleeping, and traveling between terrestrial forest patches,
   and some were observed as much as 3 km from the nearest permanently dry
   land. However, most records were anecdotal and thus tell us little about
   lemur ecology in this habitat. Mangroves are more widely used by lemurs
   than has previously been recognized and merit greater attention from
   primate researchers and conservationists in Madagascar.},

Abstract = {Primate populations, including Madagascar's lemurs, are threatened
   worldwide and conservationists need accurate population estimates to
   develop targeted conservation plans. We sought to fill knowledge gaps
   for three lemur taxa -white-fronted brown lemur (Eulemur albifrons);
   eastern woolly lemur (Avahi laniger); and Allocebus/Microcebus, a
   category combining observations of hairy-eared dwarf lemurs (Allocebus
   trichotis) and mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.)- in northeastern
   Madagascar by estimating their density, examining how their encounter
   rates and densities vary across three different forest types, and
   monitoring trends in encounter rates and densities at resurveyed sites,
   using data from surveys at six forest sites over a 4-year period
   (2010-2013). Landscape density for white-fronted brown lemur, eastern
   woolly lemur, and Allocebus/Microcebus was 21.5 (SE 3.67), 57.7 (SE
   9.17), and 39.1 (SE 9.55) individuals/km(2), respectively. There was no
   difference in density estimates at intact and intermediately degraded
   forest sites; however, we encountered white-fronted brown lemurs more
   often in intact forest (1.64 +/- SE 0.40 individuals/km) than in
   intermediately degraded and degraded forest (0.15 +/- SE 0.06 and 0.16
   +/- SE 0.06 individuals/km). In addition, we encountered white-fronted
   brown lemurs at lower rates in 2013 (0.15 +/- SE 0.06 individuals/km)
   compared to 2010 (0.82 +/- SE 0.12 individuals/km) at a resurveyed site.
   Our findings emphasize that primate researchers must account for
   variation in how lemur encounter rates and densities differ between
   intact and degraded forests, and although we observed a decline in
   white-fronted brown lemur encounter rate at our resurveyed site, we
   caution that changes in lemur encounter rates may simply reflect lower
   detection rates rather than lower density. Future research should focus
   on using conventional distance sampling techniques, which are
   infrequently used in primate studies, to provide more robust density
   estimates as a way to accurately assess trends and the effects of
   anthropogenic pressures on lemur populations.},

Abstract = {As the smallest living primate, the mouse lemur is a suitable model for
   reconstructing the locomotor mechanisms by which primate ancestors might
   have responded to the challenges of an arboreal environment. In this
   study, we tested the effects of substrate diameter and orientation on
   quadrupedal gait kinematics in mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). Mouse
   lemurs highly preferred asymmetrical to symmetrical gaits as they moved
   across a flat board and poles of three diameters (2.5, 1.0, and 0.5 cm),
   set at horizontal, 30 degrees inclined, and 30 degrees declined
   orientations. During symmetrical gaits, mouse lemurs used diagonal
   sequence walking and ambling gaits on the same substrates and at the
   same duty factors for which some similarly sized nonprimate mammals use
   lateral sequence gaits, suggesting that reliance on diagonal sequence
   walking in primates may not be explicitly a response to body size
   relative to substrate diameter. When using asymmetrical gaits, kinematic
   adjustments to small diameter and/or nonhorizontal substrates included a
   preference for transverse gallops over other gaits, the avoidance of
   whole-body suspensions, increases in limb contact duration, and
   increases in the time interval between the landing of trailing and
   leading limbs. All of these adjustments are consistent with increasing
   locomotor stability by dampening center of mass movements and reducing
   the forces imparted to the substrate. Like mouse lemurs, small-bodied
   ancestral primates likely used symmetrical gaits occasionally, but more
   frequently used asymmetrical gaits that were adjusted in response to
   challenging substrates. Therefore, asymmetrical gait dynamics should be
   incorporated into hypotheses addressing early primate locomotor
   evolution. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Volume = {37},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Behavior varies among individuals and is flexible within individuals.
   However, studies of behavioral syndromes and animal personality have
   demonstrated that animals can show consistency in their behavior and as
   such may be restricted in their behavioral responses. Like any other
   trait, including morphology, performance, or physiology, personality is
   now considered an important component of ecology and may have fitness
   consequences. Moreover, in some species personality correlates with
   other traits, as predicted in the context of a recent theoretical
   framework postulating that individual differences in growth and body
   size can affect behavior through effects on growth-mortality tradeoffs.
   This ``pace of life{''} hypothesis predicts that animals that explore
   more should be larger and have higher growth rates than those that
   explore less. We tested for associations between morphology and a
   behavioral trait in a captive colony of gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   murinus). We used open-field tests to evaluate exploration behavior and
   measured a series of morphological traits in 72 individuals (32 males
   and 40 females). Our results show that the latency to start exploring
   correlates positively with adult body size and body weight at birth.
   These data provide evidence for a link between morphology and behavior
   in this species, thus supporting predictions of dispersal models but
   diverging from the predictions of the ``pace of life{''} model.},

Title = {The role of acoustic signals for species recognition in redfronted
   lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons)},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAY 12},
Abstract = {Background: Signals are essential for communication and play a
   fundamental role in the evolution and diversification of species.
   Olfactory, visual and acoustic species-specific signals have been shown
   to function for species recognition in non-human primates, but the
   relative contributions of selection for species recognition driven by
   sexual selection, natural selection, or genetic drift for the
   diversification of these signals remain largely unexplored. This study
   investigates the importance of acoustic signals for species recognition
   in redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons). We conducted playback
   experiments in both major populations of this species separated by
   several hundred kilometers: Kirindy Forest in the west and Ranomafana
   National Park in the east of Madagascar. The playback stimuli were
   composed of species-specific loud calls of E. rufifrons, three closely
   related species (E. albifrons, E. fulvus and E. rufus) and one
   genetically more distant species (E. rubriventer) that occurs in
   sympatry with eastern redfronted lemurs. We tested the ability of
   redfronted lemurs to discriminate conspecific from heterospecific loud
   calls by measuring the time spent looking towards the speaker after
   presentation of each loud call. We also tested the difference between
   female and male responses because loud calls may play a role in mate
   choice and the avoidance of heterospecific mating.
   Results: Redfronted lemurs in Kirindy Forest did not discriminate their
   own loud calls from those of E. albifrons, E. fulvus and E. rufus, but
   they discriminated loud calls of E. rubriventer from their own. The
   Ranomafana population was tested only with three playback stimuli (E.
   rufifrons, E. albifrons, E. rubriventer) and did not discriminate
   between their own loud calls and those of E. albifrons and E.
   rubriventer. The response of females and males to playbacks did not
   differ in both populations. However, subjects in Ranomafana National
   Park responded more strongly to playback stimuli from E. rubriventer
   than subjects in Kirindy Forest.
   Conclusions: We conclude that in both populations individuals were not
   able to discriminate between loud calls of closely related species
   living in allopatry and that responses to more distantly related
   congeners are likely to be modulated by experience. Subjects in
   Ranomafana paid more attention to loud calls of syntopic E. rubriventer
   in comparison to the Kirindy subjects, suggesting that experience is
   important in facilitating discrimination. Because acoustic and genetic
   distances among eulemurs are correlated, diversification in their
   acoustic signals might be the result of genetic drift.},

Abstract = {Chimpanzees in laboratory colonies experience more wounds on weekdays
   than on weekends, which has been attributed to the increased number of
   people present during the week; thus, the presence of more people was
   interpreted as stressful. If this were also true for primates in zoos,
   where high human presence is a regular feature, this would clearly be of
   concern. Here we examine wounding rates in two primate species
   (chimpanzees Pan troglodytes and ring-tailed lemurs Lemur catta) at
   three different zoos, to determine whether they correlate with mean
   number of visitors to the zoo. Wounding data were obtained from a zoo
   electronic record keeping system (ZIMSTM). The pattern of wounds did not
   correlate with mean gate numbers for those days for either species in

Title = {The Influence of Visitor Interaction on the Behavior of Captive Crowned

Abstract = {Research suggests that zoo visitors can have positive, negative, and
   neutral impacts on captive primate welfare; however, research
   investigating the implications of visitor-animal feeding experiences is
   extremely limited. In the UK, a large proportion of BIAZA zoos that
   house lemur species offer visitor interaction experiences (16 out of
   33). This study investigated the impact on the behavior of a family
   group of crowned lemurs (Eulemur coronatus) housed at Newquay Zoo, UK of
   visitors, accompanied by a keeper, entering the enclosure to feed the
   lemurs. Behavior was observed under four conditions: (i) during visitor
   feed; (ii) 30 min post-visitor feed; (iii) during a keeper feed; and
   (iv) 30 min post-keeper feed. Keeper feeds were conducted by keepers
   only, on the day after visitor feeds. The lemur group spent
   significantly less time performing aggressive behavior and was also
   significantly more interactive with keepers during visitor feeds
   compared with keeper-only feeds. There was no significant difference in
   behaviors performed immediately after interacting with visitors. Over
   the study period, there was a tendency for interactions with visitors to
   increase, and for interactions with keepers during visitor feeds to
   decrease. After a 28-day interval without visitor interaction, the
   lemurs' interaction with visitors had returned to the level recorded at
   the start of the study. In conclusion, visitor interaction did not
   compromise the welfare of the study subjects in either the short-or
   long-term, while an increase in visitor interactions over time has
   interesting implications for the enrichment properties of, or
   habituation to, unfamiliar humans. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Title = {Unusual sleeping site selection by southern bamboo lemurs},
Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},
Pages = {167-173},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Selection of sleeping sites has consequences for individual fitness.
   Non-human primates often bias their selection towards arboreal sites,
   and the lemurs of Madagascar typically rest/sleep in trees, tree holes,
   and/or constructed nests. Three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses to
   explain sleeping site selection include protection from predators,
   avoidance of parasitic vectors, and improved thermoregulation. Here, we
   examine these hypotheses for the unusual sleeping site selections by the
   southern bamboo lemur (Hapalemur meridionalis). Within the Mandena
   littoral forest of southeast Madagascar, the southern bamboo lemur is
   known for its ecological flexibility compared to other bamboo lemur
   species, including a dietary niche expansion to feeding on the ground.
   Between October 2012 and December 2013, we observed bamboo lemurs from
   three social groups for 1778.67 h, conducting full-day focal follows on
   11 adult individuals (five males, six females). During this period, all
   three groups were observed to sleep on the ground, with one of these
   groups also using an abandoned nest of a Madagascar crested ibis
   (Lophotibis cristata). We collected habitat and temperature data to
   examine whether selection was influenced by environmental variables.
   Terrestrial sleeping (N = 17) was observed in all individuals but one
   adult female, with individuals burrowing under thick vegetation more
   often during the hot austral summer. While difficult to rigorously test,
   it is possible that terrestrial sleep sites and/or sleeping in a bird
   nest may impair visual detection by some aerial and terrestrial
   predators. Neither of these sites (i.e., terrestrial sleeping or use of
   a bird nest), however, is likely to minimize exposure to
   parasites/vectors. Terrestrial sleeping appears to support a
   thermoregulatory strategy, whereas the use of a bird nest could not be
   empirically tested. Our observations of unique sleeping site locations
   used by southern bamboo lemurs further the complexity of their natural
   history and that of Malagasy strepsirrhines.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Forty-three strains of bifidobacteria were isolated from the faeces of
   two adult black lemurs, Eulemur macaco. Thirty-four were identified as
   Bifidobacterium lemurum, recently described in Lemur catta. The nine
   remaining isolates were Gram -positive -staining, non -spore -forming,
   fructose -6 -phosphate phosphoketolase-positive, microaerophilic,
   irregular rod -shaped bacteria that often presented Y- or V-shaped
   cells. Typing techniques revealed that these isolates were nearly
   identical, and strain LMM\_E3(T) was chosen as a representative and
   characterized further. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene
   sequences clustered this isolate inside the genus Bifidobacterium and
   showed the highest levels of sequence similarity with B. lemurum DSM
   28807(T) (99.3\%), with Bifidobacterium pullorum LMG 21816(T) and
   Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697(T) (96.4 and 96.3\%,
   respectively) as the next most similar strains. The hsp60 gene sequence
   of strain LMM\_E3(T) showed the highest similarity to that of
   Bifidobacterium stellenboschense DSM 23968T (93.3\%), and 91.0\%
   similarity to that of the type strain of B. lemurum. DNA DNA
   reassociation with the closest neighbour B. lemurum DSM 28807(T) was
   found to be 65.4\%. The DNA G+C content was 62.3 mol\%. Strain LMM\_E3T
   showed a peptidoglycan structure that has not been detected in
   bifidobacteria so far: A3a L-Lys L-Ser L-Thr L-Ala. Based on the
   phylogenetic, genotypic and phenotypic data, strain LMM\_E3T represents
   a novel species within the genus Bifidobacterium, for which the name
   Bifidobacterium eulemuris sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is
   LMM\_E3(T) (=DSM 100216(T)=JCM 30801(T)).},

Title = {Resource Seasonality and Reproduction Predict Fission-Fusion Dynamics in

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {78},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Ruffed lemurs (genus Varecia) are often described as having a flexible
   social organization, such that both cohesive (low fission-fusion
   dynamics) and fluid (high fission-fusion dynamics) grouping patterns
   have been observed. In ruffed lemur communities with high fission-fusion
   dynamics, group members vary in their temporal and spatial dispersion
   throughout a communally defended territory. These patterns have been
   likened to those observed in several haplorrhine species that exhibit
   the most fluid types of fission-fusion social organization (e. g., Pan
   and Ateles). To substantiate and further refine these claims, we
   describe the fission-fusion dynamics of a black-and-white ruffed lemur
   (Varecia variegata) community at Mangevo, an undisturbed primary
   rainforest site in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. We collected
   instantaneous group scan samples from August 2007-December 2008 (4,044
   observation hours) to study and characterize patterns of subgroup size,
   composition, cohesion, and social association. In 16 consecutive months,
   we never found all members of the community together. In fact,
   individuals spent nearly half of their time alone. Subgroups were small,
   cohesive, and typically of mixed-sex composition. Mixed-sex subgroups
   were significantly larger, less cohesive, and more common than either
   male-only or female-only subgroups. Subgroup dynamics were related to
   shifts in climate, phenology of preferred fruit species, and female
   reproductive state. Onaverage, association indices were low. Males and
   females were equally gregarious; however, adult male-male associations
   were significantly weaker than any other association type. Results
   presented herein document striking differences in fission-fusion
   dynamics between black-and-white ruffed lemurs and haplorrhines, while
   also demonstrating many broad-scale similarities to haplorrhine taxa
   that possess the most fluid fission-fusion societies. (C) 2015 Wiley

Title = {Environmental Correlates of Body Mass in True Lemurs (Eulemur spp.)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-108},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {An organism's body size is intrinsically related to its metabolic
   requirements, life history profile, and ecological niche. Previous work
   in primates generally, and lemurs specifically, has shown that body size
   often correlates with ecological parameters related to temperature and
   energy availability in the environment, although other studies indicate
   the absence of any such patterns in lemurs. Here we test hypotheses that
   predict that body mass in Eulemur should covary with 1) overall food
   availability or resource seasonality and/or 2) temperature, i.e.,
   Bergmann's rule. We use data from 722 wild true lemurs to identify
   population-specific body mass for 27 populations representing 11 of the
   12 described Eulemur species, and derive climatic data for each
   population from the WorldClim database. We use phylogenetic generalized
   least squares models to evaluate these hypotheses and find that body
   mass significantly negatively correlates with annual mean temperature
   and positively correlates with standard deviation of temperature, but
   does not significantly correlate with annual rainfall or number of dry
   months. These results indicate that body mass distribution across
   populations in Eulemur is consistent with Bergmann's rule, but does not
   track resource seasonality as seen in other lemurs, e.g., Propithecus.
   We suggest that the fact that body mass in various lemur radiations
   correlates with different environmental variables may result in these
   patterns being obscured when such taxa are combined in a single
   analysis. This may help explain why some previous work has found little
   evidence of ecogeographical correlates with body mass across all
   Lemuriformes.},

   context of primate origins and as an indicator of age-induced loss in
   overall performance, little is known about the proximate determinants of
   variation in strength. We measured hand pull strength in 62 adult
   captive individuals of grey mouse lemurs Microcebus murinus of known
   age. In addition, we measured the body mass and the length of the
   forearm in each individual. Our results showed that animals with a
   longer ulna, and animals that weighed more, and had a greater relative
   body mass had higher pull strength. However, despite the fact that
   females are bigger than males, differences in pull strength were not
   significantly different between the two sexes. Although comparative data
   for other species of vertebrates are scarce, our data suggest that mouse
   lemurs have relatively high pull strength for their size that may be
   interpreted as an adaptation to arboreal locomotion.},

Title = {Diet and effects of Sanford's brown lemur (Eulemur sanfordi, Archbold
   1932) gut-passage on the germination of plant species in Amber forest,
   Madagascar},
Journal = {ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {55},
Abstract = {Kaloantsimo Sarah Chen, Jun Qing Li, Jean Rasoarahona, Fousseni Folega,
   and Christophe Manjaribe (2016) Eulemur sanfordi belongs to a group of
   endemic lemur species in Amber Mountain National Park, Madagascar. The
   diet of E. sanfordi and the effects of gut-passage on the germination of
   seeds were studied to determine how the feeding activities of this lemur
   affect the integrity of this forest ecosystem. A specific group of E.
   sanfordi was observed and monitored during 396 hours from the end of the
   dry season to the beginning of the rainy season. Field observers
   recorded the food items taken, plant species consumed, plants organs
   preferred and the forest layer in which food was harvested by this
   species. Seeds were sorted from discarded food items left by the group
   of E. sanfordi being followed. Germination tests allowed analysis of the
   germination potential of the collected seeds. Feeding times for E.
   sanfordi varied significantly (p = 0.01) across the study period (from
   September to February). Their feeding activities were intense between
   December and February, peaking in January (90\%). They spent more time
   eating fruits than other organs of plants. Feeding patterns on ripe
   fruit also varied significantly (p = 0.01) during the study. E. sanfordi
   consumed 34 plant species, with 21\% from the family of Moraceae. This
   group of observed lemurs consumed 9 to 17 plant species per month and
   preferred trees greater than 10 m tall. Overall, seeds that passed
   through the gut of these lemurs had significantly higher germination
   rates than those seeds that did not (t = 5.87, p = 0.02). The average
   latency period of passed and control seeds ranged from 35 to 83 days and
   from 52 to 95 days, respectively. E. sanfordi's gut passage provides
   better germination of seeds species they consumed. This could contribute
   to the conservation of plant diversity. E. sanfordi play an important
   role in Amber forest ecosystem to preserve some endemic species.},

Title = {Latrine behaviour as a multimodal communicatory signal station in wild
   lemurs: the case of Hapalemur meridionalis},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {57-67},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Latrine behaviour is the repeated use of specific sites for
   defecation/urination, and is common among most mammals, including
   carnivores, herbivores, marsupials and rodents. While rare among
   primates, latrine use has been observed among some lemurs. It has been
   hypothesized that group-living primates may use latrines to maintain
   intergroup spacing (i.e. territorial defence) and for female
   advertisement of sexual condition. To test these, we conducted focal
   follows of three neighbouring southern bamboo lemur, Hapalemur
   meridionalis, groups in Mandena littoral forest of southeast Madagascar.
   From January to December 2013, we recorded all occurrences of latrine
   behaviour and characterized latrine sites to determine what factors
   influenced returning to specific latrines. Additionally, we attempted to
   elucidate the functional role of scent marking at latrines. We assessed
   the degree of home range overlap between neighbouring groups, and
   recorded intergroup aggression. Overall, latrines were almost
   exclusively visually conspicuous sites and located in the core areas of
   group home ranges. Best-fit models indicated that multiply visited
   latrines occurred more often in core areas, and were influenced by both
   sexes. Glandular scent marking at latrine sites was driven by males, and
   occurred more during the nonmating season. Males overmarked female
   scent-marks less often during the mating season and more often when
   younger males were likely to disperse. Thus, overmarking at latrine
   sites may function as a mate-guarding strategy to deter new males.
   Latrine use supports the energy frugality hypothesis, which proposes
   that lemur social systems, known for female social dominance and low
   rates of agonism, evolved as responses to the low productivity of
   Malagasy forests. The deposition of olfactory cues (i.e. faeces, urine,
   glandular secretions) at visually conspicuous sites may convey
   information to neighbouring conspecifics, thus reducing the need for
   intergroup agonism. Overall, latrine behaviour acts as a multimodal
   means of intergroup communication. (C) 2015 The Association for the

Abstract = {The African Non-Spiny (ANS) clade contains 14 species of mostly large
   canopy lianas or scandent shrubs confined to Madagascar (10) and
   continental Africa (4, with with one species reaching the southern
   Arabian peninsula). Members of the clade were previously classified in
   sections Afrosolanum Bitter, Benderianum Bitter, Lemurisolanum Bitter,
   Macronesiotes Bitter and Quadrangulare Bitter, and were throught to be
   related to a variety of New World groups. The group is an
   early-branching lineage of non-spiny solanums and characters shared with
   other vining New World solanums are homoplastic. The 14 species of the
   group occupy a wide range of habitats, from wet forests in western
   Africa to savanna and dry forests of southern Madagascar and dune
   habitats in South Africa. Many members of the group are highly variable
   morphologically, and habit can vary between shrub and canopy vine in a
   single locality. We here review the taxonomic history, morphology,
   potential relationships and ecology of these species; we provide keys
   for their identification, descriptions, full synonymy (including
   designations of lectotypes and neotypes) and nomenclatural notes.

Title = {Jumping Stand Apparatus Reveals Rapidly Specific Age-Related Cognitive
   Impairments in Mouse Lemur Primates},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 30},
Abstract = {The mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is a promising primate model for
   investigating normal and pathological cerebral aging. The locomotor
   behavior of this arboreal primate is characterized by jumps to and from
   trunks and branches. Many reports indicate insufficient adaptation of
   the mouse lemur to experimental devices used to evaluate its cognition,
   which is an impediment to the efficient use of this animal in research.
   In order to develop cognitive testing methods appropriate to the
   behavioral and biological traits of this species, we adapted the Lashley
   jumping stand apparatus, initially designed for rats, to the mouse
   lemur. We used this jumping stand apparatus to compare performances of
   young (n = 12) and aged (n = 8) adults in acquisition and long-term
   retention of visual discriminations. All mouse lemurs completed the
   tasks and only 25 trials, on average, were needed to master the first
   discrimination problem with no age-related differences. A month later,
   all mouse lemurs made progress for acquiring the second discrimination
   problem but only the young group reached immediately the criterion in
   the retention test of the first discrimination problem. This study shows
   that the jumping stand apparatus allows rapid and efficient evaluation
   of cognition in mouse lemurs and demonstrates that about half of the old
   mouse lemurs display a specific deficit in long-term retention but not
   in acquisition of visual discrimination.},

Abstract = {The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is considered a useful primate
   model for translational research. In the framework of IMI PharmaCog
   project (Grant Agreement no 115009, www.pharmacog.org), we tested the
   hypothesis that spectral electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of motor
   and locomotor activity in gray mouse lemurs reflect typical
   movement-related desynchronization of alpha rhythms (about 8-12 Hz) in
   humans. To this aim, EEG (bipolar electrodes in frontal cortex) and
   electromyographic (EMG; bipolar electrodes sutured in neck muscles) data
   were recorded in 13 male adult (about 3 years) lemurs. Artifact-free EEG
   segments during active state (gross movements, exploratory movements or
   locomotor activity) and awake passive state (no sleep) were selected on
   the basis of instrumental measures of animal behavior, and were used as
   an input for EEG power density analysis. Results showed a clear peak of
   EEG power density at alpha range (7-9 Hz) during passive state. During
   active state, there was a reduction in alpha power density (8-12 Hz) and
   an increase of power density at slow frequencies (1-4 Hz). Relative EMG
   activity was related to EEG power density at 2-4 Hz (positive
   correlation) and at 8-12 Hz (negative correlation). These results
   suggest for the first time that the primate gray mouse lemurs and humans
   may share basic neurophysiologic mechanisms of synchronization of
   frontal alpha rhythms in awake passive state and their desynchronization
   during motor and locomotor activity. These EEG markers may be an ideal
   experimental model for translational basic (motor science) and applied
   (pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions) research in
   Neurophysiology.},

Title = {The Use of an Invasive Species Habitat by a Small Folivorous Primate:
   Implications for Lemur Conservation in Madagascar},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {The lemurs of Madagascar are among the most threatened mammalian taxa in
   the world, with habitat loss due to shifting cultivation and timber
   harvest heavily contributing to their precarious state. Deforestation
   often leads to fragmentation, resulting in mixed-habitat matrices
   throughout a landscape where disturbed areas are prone to invasion by
   exotic plants. Our study site, the Mandena littoral forest (southeast
   Madagascar), is a matrix of littoral forest, littoral swamp, and
   Melaleuca swamp habitats. Here, Melaleuca quinquenervia has invaded the
   wetland ecosystem, creating a mono-dominant habitat that currently
   provides the only potential habitat corridor between forest fragments.
   We sought to understand the role of this invasive Melaleuca swamp on the
   behavioral ecology of a threatened, small-bodied folivore, the southern
   bamboo lemur (Hapalemur meridionalis). We collected botanical and
   behavioral data on four groups of H. meridionalis between January and
   December 2013. Our results confirm Melaleuca swamp as an important part
   of their home range: while lemurs seasonally limited activities to
   certain habitats, all groups were capable of utilizing this invasive
   habitat for feeding and resting. Furthermore, the fact that Hapalemur
   use an invasive plant species as a dispersal corridor increases our
   knowledge of their ecological flexibility, and may be useful in the
   conservation management of remaining threatened populations.},

Title = {Shades of Gray Mouse Lemurs: Ontogeny of Female Dominance and

Volume = {77},

Abstract = {The ontogeny and establishment of dominance relationships in young
   individuals have been investigated in various group-living, diurnal
   primates but respective information is almost entirely lacking for
   nocturnal, non-gregarious species. As in many other mammals male
   primates often represent the dominant sex, but the opposite phenomenon
   (female dominance) is particularly frequent in lemurs, although almost
   nothing is known about its development. Therefore, we investigated the
   development of intersexual dominance in parallel to age-related changes
   in other relevant behaviors in the gray mouse lemur, a solitary forager
   with female dominance. In particular, the temporal trajectories of
   social play, marking behavior, social tolerance, and agonistic behaviors
   were characterized in captive dyads of three different age categories
   (ACs), among juveniles (ACI: 4-5 months, N = 6), adolescents (ACII: 8-9
   months, N = 8) and young adults (ACIII: 12-13 months, N = 8). Data were
   collected during a series of three encounter experiments between one
   male and one female per dyad and age category (total observation time:
   49.5 hr). Play behavior was observed in all age classes, although the
   number of playing dyads decreased with increasing age. A significant
   age-dependent increase in marking behavior was found in females,
   especially in substrate rubbing and urine washing, but not in males.
   Although conflict rates did not differ significantly between ACs,
   females started to win more conflicts from ACII onwards, and social
   tolerance decreased partly with increasing age. Clear dominance
   relationships were not observed in ACI and first indications of dominant
   females were found in ACII with an increasing number in ACIII. This
   study provides first information about the ontogeny of female dominance
   in a nocturnal primate and shows that this behavior develops relatively
   late during ontogeny. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for
   significant changes in the social lives of maturing mouse lemurs and a
   rather late social maturation in this species. (C) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {The species-level diversity of Madagascar's lemurs has increased hugely
   over the last two decades, growing from 32 species in 1994 to 102
   species in 2014. This growth is primarily due to the application of
   molecular phylogenetic analyses and the phylogenetic species concept to
   known populations, and few previously unknown lemur populations have
   been discovered during this time. We report on a new population of dwarf
   lemurs (Cheirogaleus sp.) from Nosy Hara, a 312-ha island in far
   northern Madagascar, which constitutes the northernmost distribution
   record for the genus. The dwarf lemurs appeared to show two
   characteristics of island populations-insular dwarfism and predator na <
   vet,-that suggest a long isolation, and may thus represent an
   undescribed taxon. If this is the case, the dwarf lemurs of Nosy Hara
   are probably one of the rarest primate taxa on Earth.},

Title = {Host sex and age influence endoparasite burdens in the gray mouse lemur},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Introduction: Immunosenescence (deteriorating immune function at old
   age) affects humans and laboratory animals, but little is known about
   immunosenescence in natural populations despite its potential importance
   for population and disease dynamics and individual fitness. Although
   life histories and immune system profiles often differ between the
   sexes, sex-specific effects of aging on health are rarely studied in the
   wild. Life history theory predicts that due to their shorter lifespan
   and higher investment into reproduction at the expense of immune
   defences, males might experience accelerated immunosenescence. We tested
   this hypothesis by examining sex-specific age trajectories of
   endoparasite burden (helminth prevalence and morphotype richness
   measured via fecal egg counts), an indicator of overall health, in wild
   gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). To account for potential
   interactions between seasonality and host sex or age we examined the
   predictors of parasite burdens separately for the dry and rainy season.
   Results: Contrary to the prediction of immunosenescence, parasite
   prevalence and morphotype richness decreased at old age in the dry
   season, indicating acquired immunity by older animals. This pattern was
   primarily caused by within-individual decline in parasite loads rather
   than the earlier mortality of highly parasitized individuals. With the
   exception of an increasing cestode prevalence in males from yearlings to
   prime age in the rainy season, no evidence was found of male-biased
   ageing in parasite resistance. Besides this sex{*}age interaction, host
   age was uncorrelated with rainy season parasite loads. Seasonality did
   not affect the overall parasite loads but seasonal patterns were found
   in the predictors of parasite prevalence and morphotype richness.
   Conclusions: These results provide rare information about the
   age-related patterns of health in a wild vertebrate population and
   suggest improvement rather than senescence in the ability to resist
   helminth infections at old age. Overall, males appear not to suffer from
   earlier immunosenescence relative to females. This may partially reflect
   the earlier mortality of males, which can render senescence difficult to
   detect. While helminth infections are not strongly associated with
   survival in wild gray mouse lemurs, parasite load may, however, reflect
   overall good phenotypic quality of long-lived individuals, and is a
   potential correlate of fitness.},

Abstract = {The life history of mammals underlies a fast-slow continuum, ranging
   from ``slow{''} species with large body size, delayed sexual maturation,
   low fertility, and long lifespan, to ``fast{''} species showing the
   opposite traits. Primates fall into the ``slow{''} category, considering
   their relatively low offspring numbers and delayed juvenile development.
   However, social and sexual maturation processes do not necessarily have
   to be completed simultaneously. The comparison of the timeframes for
   sexual and social maturation is largely lacking for primates, with the
   prominent exception of humans. Here, we compare both maturation
   processes in a basal primate, the gray mouse lemur, which ranges in many
   aspects at the fast end of the slow-fast life history continuum among
   primates. We compared the patterns and frequencies of various social and
   solitary behaviors in young adults (YA, 12-13 months old) and older
   individuals (A, >= 2 years) of both sexes outside estrus. Observations
   were conducted during mix-sexed dyadic encounter experiments under
   controlled captive conditions (eight dyads per age class). Results
   indicate that although all young adults were sexually mature, social
   maturation was not yet completed in all behavioral domains:
   Age-dependent differences were found in the number of playing dyads,
   female marking behavior, female aggression, and social tolerance. Thus,
   this study provides a first indication that social maturation lags
   behind sexual maturation in an ancestral nocturnal primate model,
   indicating that these two developmental schemes may have been decoupled
   early and throughout the primate lineage. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {Lemurs, the living primates most distantly related to humans,
   demonstrate incredible diversity in behaviour, life history patterns and
   adaptive traits. Although many lemur species are endangered within their
   native Madagascar, there is no high-quality genome assembly from this
   taxon, limiting population and conservation genetic studies. One
   critically endangered lemur is the blue-eyed black lemur Eulemur
   flavifrons. This species is fixed for blue irises, a convergent trait
   that evolved at least four times in primates and was subject to positive
   selection in humans, where 5 regulatory variation of OCA2 explains most
   of the brown/blue eye colour differences. We built a de novo genome
   assembly for E.flavifrons, providing the most complete lemur genome to
   date, and a high confidence consensus sequence for close sister species
   E.macaco, the (brown-eyed) black lemur. From diversity and divergence
   patterns across the genomes, we estimated a recent split time of the two
   species (160Kya) and temporal fluctuations in effective population sizes
   that accord with known environmental changes. By looking for regions of
   unusually low diversity, we identified potential signals of directional
   selection in E.flavifrons at MITF, a melanocyte development gene that
   regulates OCA2 and has previously been associated with variation in
   human iris colour, as well as at several other genes involved in melanin
   biosynthesis in mammals. Our study thus illustrates how whole-genome
   sequencing of a few individuals can illuminate the demographic and
   selection history of nonmodel species.},

Title = {The largest relative testis size among primates and aseasonal
   reproduction in a nocturnal lemur, Mirza zaza},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {158},
Number = {1},
Pages = {165-169},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {ObjectivesTestis size is an indirect indicator of a species' mating
   system, along with sexual size and canine dimorphism, existence and
   usage of mating and advertisement calls as well as the spatial
   distribution of males and females ready to mate in solitary species.
   Upon its recent discovery, the northern giant mouse lemur Mirza zaza was
   suggested to have a polygynandrous mating system and to exhibit seasonal
   breeding. We tested these predictions in a field study in Sahamalaza
   National Park, NW Madagascar.
   Materials and MethodsWe caught 12 M. zaza, before and during the
   suggested mating period and obtained standard field morphometric
   measurements, including testes size.
   ResultsWe show that M. zaza has the highest relative testis volume among
   primates, indicating strong sperm competition and polygynandrous mating.
   In addition, based on inferred age of captured animals, observed mating
   behavior, a female caught in met-estrus and data from captivity, we
   suggest M. zaza to be one of the few lemurs that breed aseasonally.
   DiscussionFuture field work on this endangered species is required to
   illuminate the causes and consequences of intense promiscuity and
   aseasonal breeding despite strong habitat seasonality, which distinguish
   M. zaza from most other nocturnal lemurs. Am J Phys Anthropol

Title = {Lemur Biorhythms and Life History Evolution},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {Skeletal histology supports the hypothesis that primate life histories
   are regulated by a neuroendocrine rhythm, the Havers-Halberg Oscillation
   (HHO). Interestingly, subfossil lemurs are outliers in HHO scaling
   relationships that have been discovered for haplorhine primates and
   other mammals. We present new data to determine whether these species
   represent the general lemur or strepsirrhine condition and to inform
   models about neuroendocrinemediated life history evolution. We gathered
   the largest sample to date of HHO data from histological sections of
   primate teeth (including the subfossil lemurs) to assess the
   relationship of these chronobiological measures with life
   history-related variables including body mass, brain size, age at first
   female reproduction, and activity level. For anthropoids, these
   variables show strong correlations with HHO conforming to predictions,
   though body mass and endocranial volume are strongly correlated with HHO
   periodicity in this group. However, lemurs (possibly excepting
   Daubentonia) do not follow this pattern and show markedly less
   variability in HHO periodicity and lower correlation coefficients and
   slopes. Moreover, body mass is uncorrelated, and brain size and activity
   levels are more strongly correlated with HHO periodicity in these
   animals. We argue that lemurs evolved this pattern due to selection for
   risk-averse life histories driven by the unpredictability of the
   environment in Madagascar. These results reinforce the idea that HHO
   influences life history evolution differently in response to specific
   ecological selection regimes.},

Abstract = {Chronic stress {[}i.e. long-term elevation of glucocorticoid (GC)
   levels] and aging have similar, negative effects on the functioning of
   an organism. Aged individuals' declining ability to regulate GC levels
   may therefore impair their ability to cope with stress, as found in
   humans. The coping of aged animals with long-term natural stressors is
   virtually unstudied, even though the ability to respond appropriately to
   stressors is likely integral to the reproduction and survival of wild
   animals. To assess the effect of age on coping with naturally
   fluctuating energetic demands, we measured stress hormone output via GC
   metabolites in faecal samples (fGCM) of wild grey mouse lemurs
   (Microcebus murinus) in different ecological seasons. Aged individuals
   were expected to exhibit elevated fGCM levels under energetically
   demanding conditions. In line with this prediction, we found a positive
   age effect in the dry season, when food and water availability are low
   and mating takes place, suggesting impaired coping of aged wild animals.
   The age effect was significantly stronger in females, the longer-lived
   sex. Body mass of males but not females correlated positively with fGCM
   in the dry season. Age or body mass did not influence fGCM significantly
   in the rainy season. The sex- and season-specific predictors of fGCM may
   reflect the differential investment of males and females into
   reproduction and longevity. A review of prior research indicates
   contradictory aging patterns in GC regulation across and even within
   species. The context of sampling may influence the likelihood of
   detecting senescent declines in GC functioning.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A 20-y-old, male, ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) presented with a
   large, firm mass on the proximal caudolateral left femur. The animal
   displayed no clinical signs associated with the mass. Radiographs
   revealed a mineralized mass protruding from the femur, with an intact
   femoral cortex. Histopathology diagnosed osteochondroma in view of the
   presence of a peripheral layer of cartilage with progressive
   endochondral ossification and typical remodeling of bony trabeculae. The
   mass grew quickly after the initial biopsy, and a second surgery to
   debulk 95\% of the tumor was performed. Histopathologic features of the
   larger samples were similar to those of the initial biopsies, with the
   cartilage layer being discontinuous and development of bone from some
   borders progressing directly from a periost-like layer. Nineteen months
   after the second surgery, the mass had regrown and extended further
   proximally on the femur toward the epiphysis, but the animal remained
   asymptomatic, and additional debulking was not attempted. This report is
   the first description of an osteochondroma in a prosimian and describes
   unique behavior of the tumor compared with osteochondromas found in
   humans, dogs, and cats.},

Abstract = {There is limited information available on the morphology of the thoracic
   limb of the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta). This study describes the
   morphology of the thoracic limb of captive ring-tailed lemurs evidenced
   by gross osteology and radiography as a guide for clinical use.
   Radiographic findings of 12 captive ring-tailed lemurs are correlated
   with bone specimens of three adult animals. The clavicle is well
   developed. The scapula has a large area for the origin of the m. teres
   major. The coracoid and hamate processes are well developed. The lateral
   supracondylar crest and medial epicondyle are prominent. The metacarpal
   bones are widely spread, and the radial tuberosity is prominent. These
   features indicate the presence of strong flexor muscles and flexibility
   of thoracic limb joints, which are important in arboreal quadrupedal
   locomotion. Furthermore, an ovoid ossicle is always seen at the
   inter-phalangeal joint of the first digit. Areas of increased soft
   tissue opacity are superimposed over the proximal half of the humerus
   and distal half of the antebrachium in male animals as a result of the
   scent gland. Knowledge of the morphology of the thoracic limb of
   individual species is important for accurate interpretation and
   diagnosis of musculoskeletal diseases.},

Abstract = {Decreased brain content of DHA, the most abundant long-chain n-3
   polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA) in the brain, is accompanied by
   severe neurosensorial impairments linked to impaired neurotransmission
   and impaired brain glucose utilization. In the present study, we
   hypothesized that increasing n-3 LCPUFA intake at an early age may help
   to prevent or correct the glucose hypometabolism observed during aging
   and age-related cognitive decline. The effects of 12 months'
   supplementation with n-3 LCPUFA on brain glucose utilization assessed by
   positron emission tomography was tested in young adult mouse lemurs
   (Microcebus murinus). Cognitive function was tested in parallel in the
   same animals. Lemurs supplemented with n-3 LCPUFA had higher brain
   glucose uptake and cerebral metabolic rate of glucose compared with
   controls in all brain regions. The n-3 LCPUFA-supplemented animals also
   had higher exploratory activity in an open-field task and lower evidence
   of anxiety in the Barnes maze.jlr Our results demonstrate for the first
   time in a nonhuman primate that n-3 LCPUFA supplementation increases
   brain glucose uptake and metabolism and concomitantly reduces anxiety.},

Abstract = {Previously we found that Maximum Ingested Bite Size (V-b)the largest
   piece of food that an animal will ingest whole without biting
   firstscales isometrically with body size in 17 species of strepsirrhines
   at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC). However, because this earlier study
   focused on only three food types (two with similar mechanical
   properties), it did not yield results that were easily applied to
   describing the broad diets of these taxa. Expressing V-b in terms of
   food mechanical properties allows us to compare data across food types,
   including foods of wild lemurs, to better understand dietary adaptations
   in lemurs. To this end, we quantified V-b in five species of lemurs at
   the DLC representing large and small frugivores and folivores using ten
   types of food that vary widely in stiffness and toughness to determine
   how these properties relate to bite sizes. We found that although most
   species take smaller bites of stiffer foods, this negative relationship
   was not statistically significant across the whole sample. However,
   there is a significant relationship between bite size and toughness. All
   three of the more frugivorous taxa in our sample take significantly
   smaller bites of tougher foods. However, the two more folivorous lemurs
   do not. They take small bites for all foods. This suggests that the
   species most adapted to the consumption of tough foods do not modulate
   their ingestive sizes to accommodate larger pieces of weak foods. Am J

Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {56},
Number = {3},
Pages = {279-284},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Primates have been predated on by snakes throughout their evolution and
   as a result, antipredator responses accompanied by signs of fear are
   often witnessed in the wild. In captivity, however, the fear of snakes
   is less clear, as experiments with na < ve nonhuman primates have given
   inconsistent results. In this study, we present evidence that na < ve
   mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) and putatively na < ve pig-tailed
   macaques (Macaca nemestrina) do exhibit fear of snakes, even though the
   apparent reactions are mild. In an experiment with control- or
   snake-odoured boxes, mouse lemurs clearly avoided feeding in the latter.
   When the latency of touching rubber models was measured, pig-tailed
   macaques took longer to touch a toy snake compared with a toy lizard.
   Our findings that fear of snakes is shown by na < ve individuals support
   the hypothesis that it is innate in primates.},

Title = {Primate tarsal bones from Egerkingen, Switzerland, attributable to the
   middle Eocene adapiform Caenopithecus lemuroides},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {The middle Eocene species Caenopithecus lemuroides, known solely from
   the Egerkingen fissure fillings in Switzerland, was the first Paleogene
   fossil primate to be correctly identified as such (by Ludwig Rutimeyer
   in 1862), but has long been represented only by fragmentary mandibular
   and maxillary remains. More recent discoveries of adapiform fossils in
   other parts of the world have revealed Caenopithecus to be a
   biogeographic enigma, as it is potentially more closely related to
   Eocene adapiforms from Africa, Asia, and North America than it is to any
   known European forms. More anatomical evidence is needed, however, to
   provide robust tests of such phylogenetic hypotheses. Here we describe
   and analyze the first postcranial remains that can be attributed to C.
   lemuroides-an astragalus and three calcanei held in the collections of
   the Naturhistorisches Museum Basel that were likely recovered from
   Egerkingen over a century ago. Qualitative and multivariate morphometric
   analyses of these elements suggest that C. lemuroides was even more
   loris-like than European adapines such as Adapis and Leptadapis, and was
   not simply an adapine with an aberrant dentition. The astragalus of
   Caenopithecus is similar to that of younger Afradapis from the late
   Eocene of Egypt, and parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses that
   include the new tarsal data strongly support the placement of Afradapis
   and Caenopithecus as sister taxa to the exclusion of all other known
   adapiforms, thus implying that dispersal between Europe and Africa
   occurred during the middle Eocene. The new tarsal evidence, combined
   with previously known craniodental fossils, allows us to reconstruct C.
   lemuroides as having been an arboreal and highly folivorous 1.5-2.5 kg
   primate that likely moved slowly and deliberately with little or no
   capacity for acrobatic leaping, presumably maintaining consistent
   powerful grasps on branches in both above-branch and inverted postures.},

Volume = {6},
Number = {16},
Pages = {14233-14246},

Abstract = {Progression from early forms of prostate cancer to castration-resistant
   disease is associated with an increase in signal transduction activity.
   The majority of castration-resistance cancers persist in the expression
   of the androgen receptor (AR), as well as androgen-dependent genes. The
   AR is regulated not only by it associated steroid hormone, but also by
   manifold regulatory and signaling molecules, including several kinases.
   We undertook evaluation of the role of Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2 (LMTK2)
   in modulating AR activity, as several Genome Wide Association Studies
   (GWAS) have shown a marked association of LMTK2 activity with the
   development of prostate cancer. We confirm that not only is LMTK2 mRNA
   reduced in prostate cancer tissue, but also LMTK2 protein levels are
   markedly diminished. Knockdown of LMTK2 protein in prostate cell lines
   greatly increased the transcription of androgen-responsive genes. In
   addition, LMTK2 knockdown led to an increase in prostate cancer stem
   cell populations in LNCaP cells, indicative of increased tumorogenicity.
   Using multiple approaches, we also demonstrate that LMTK2 interacts with
   the AR, thus putting LMTK2 as a component of a signaling complex
   modulating AR activity. Our finding that LMTK2 is a negative regulator
   of AR activity defines a novel cellular pathway for activation of
   AR-responsive genes in castrate resistant-prostate cancer. Moreover,
   pharmacologic manipulation of LMTK2 activity will provide a novel
   therapeutic target for more effective treatments for patients with
   castrate-resistant prostate cancer.},

Title = {Systemic effects of Leucaena leucocephala ingestion on ringtailed lemurs
   (Lemur catta) at Berenty Reserve, Madagascar},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {77},
Number = {6},
Pages = {633-641},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) is a leguminous tree that is nutritious
   forage for domestic livestock when ingested in limited amounts.
   Unfortunately, leucaena contains mimosine, a plant amino acid, that can
   be toxic when ingested at higher concentrations. Reported toxic effects
   include alopecia (fur loss), poor body condition, infertility, low birth
   weight, thyroid gland dysfunction, and organ toxicity. Originally native
   to Mexico and Central America, leucaena has been introduced throughout
   the tropics, including Berenty Reserve, Madagascar where it was planted
   as supplemental browse for livestock. In Berenty, a seasonal syndrome of
   alopecia in ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta) is associated with eating
   leucaena. Although much is known about the toxic effects of leucaena and
   mimosine on domestic animals and humans, the systemic effects on
   wildlife had not been studied. In a comparison of lemurs that include
   leucaena in their diet and those that do not, we found that animals that
   ingest leucaena absorb mimosine but that ingestion does not affect body
   condition, cause kidney or liver toxicity, or affect the intestinal
   tract. Alopecia is due to mimosine's interference of the hair follicle
   cycle. Leucaena ingestion is associated with higher serum albumin,
   -tocopherol, and thyroxine concentrations, suggesting that leucaena may
   provide some nutritional benefit and that lemurs can detoxify and
   convert mimosine to a thyroid stimulating metabolite. The primary
   conservation consequence of leucaena ingestion at Berenty may be
   increased infant mortality due to the infants' inability cling to their
   alopecic mothers. The widespread introduction of leucaena throughout the
   tropics and its rapid spread in secondary forest conditions mean that
   many other leaf-eating mammals may be including this tree in their diet.
   Thus, exposure to leucaena should be considered when wildlife health is
   being evaluated, and the potential effects on wildlife health should be
   considered when contemplating leucaena introduction into or near
   wildlife habitat. Am. J. Primatol. 77:633-641, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {Four Gram-positive-staining, microaerophilic, non-spore-forming,
   fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase-positive bacterial strains were
   isolated from a faecal sample of a 5-year-old ring-tailed lemur (Lemur
   catta). The strains showed a peculiar morphology, resembling a small
   coiled snake, a ring shape, or forming a little `Y' shape. The isolated
   strains appeared identical, and LMC 13(T) was chosen as a representative
   strain and characterized further. Strain LMC 13(T) showed an A3 beta
   peptidoglycan type, similar to that found in Bifidobacterium longum. The
   DNA base composition was 57.2 mol\% G + C. Almost-complete 16S rRNA,
   hsp6D, rpoB, dnaJ, dnaG, purF, c/pC and rpoC gene sequences were
   obtained, and phylogenetic relationships were determined. Comparative
   analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain LMC 13(T) showed
   the highest similarity to B. longum subsp. suis ATCC 275331 (96.65\%)
   and Bifidobacterium saguini DSM 23967(T) (96.64\%). Strain LMC 13(T) was
   located in an actinobacterial cluster and was more closely related to
   the genus Bifidobacterium than to other genera in the
   Bifidobacteriaceae. On the basis of these results, strain LMC 13(T)
   represents a novel species within the genus Bifidobacterium, for which
   the name Bifidobacterium lemurum sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain
   is LMC 13(T) (= DSM 28807(T) = JCM 30168(T)).},

Abstract = {Innovations and problem-solving abilities can provide animals with
   important ecological advantages as they allow individuals to deal with
   novel social and ecological challenges. Innovation is a solution to a
   novel problem or a novel solution to an old problem, with the latter
   being especially difficult. Finding a new solution to an old problem
   requires individuals to inhibit previously applied solutions to invent
   new strategies and to behave flexibly. We examined the role of
   experience on cognitive flexibility to innovate and to find new
   problem-solving solutions with an artificial feeding task in wild
   redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons). Four groups of lemurs were tested
   with feeding boxes, each offering three different techniques to extract
   food, with only one technique being available at a time. After the
   subjects learned a technique, this solution was no longer successful and
   subjects had to invent a new technique. For the first transition between
   task 1 and 2, subjects had to rely on their experience of the previous
   technique to solve task 2. For the second transition, subjects had to
   inhibit the previously learned technique to learn the new task 3. Tasks
   1 and 2 were solved by most subjects, whereas task 3 was solved by only
   a few subjects. In this task, besides behavioral flexibility, especially
   persistence, i.e., constant trying, was important for individual success
   during innovation. Thus, wild strepsirrhine primates are able to
   innovate flexibly, suggesting a general ecological relevance of
   behavioral flexibility and persistence during innovation and problem
   solving across all primates.},

Title = {Primate Torpor: Regulation of Stress-activated Protein Kinases During
   Daily Torpor in the Gray Mouse Lemur, Microcebus murinus},

Abstract = {Very few selected species of primates are known to be capable of
   entering torpor. This exciting discovery means that the ability to enter
   a natural state of dormancy is an ancestral trait among primates and, in
   phylogenetic terms, is very close to the human lineage. To explore the
   regulatory mechanisms that underlie primate torpor, we analyzed signal
   transduction cascades to discover those involved in coordinating tissue
   responses during torpor. The responses of mitogen-activated protein
   kinase (MAPK) family members to primate torpor were compared in six
   organs of control (aroused) versus torpid gray mouse lemurs, Microcebus
   murinus. The proteins examined include extracellular signal-regulated
   kinases (ERKs), c-jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), MAPK kinase (MEK),
   and p38, in addition to stress-related proteins p53 and heat shock
   protein 27 (HSP27). The activation of specific MAPK signal transduction
   pathways may provide a mechanism to regulate the expression of
   torpor-responsive genes or the regulation of selected downstream
   cellular processes. In response to torpor, each MAPK subfamily responded
   differently during torpor and each showed organ-specific patterns of
   response. For example, skeletal muscle displayed elevated relative
   phosphorylation of ERK1/2 during torpor. Interestingly, adipose tissues
   showed the highest degree of MAPK activation. Brown adipose tissue
   displayed an activation of ERK1/2 and p38, whereas white adipose tissue
   showed activation of ERK1/2, p38, MEK, and JNK during torpor.
   Importantly, both adipose tissues possess specialized functions that are
   critical for torpor, with brown adipose required for non-shivering
   thermogenesis and white adipose utilized as the primary source of lipid
   fuel for torpor. Overall, these data indicate crucial roles of MAPKs in
   the regulation of primate organs during torpor.},

Abstract = {A variety of mammals employ torpor as an energy-saving strategy in
   environments of marginal or severe stress either on a daily basis during
   their inactive period or on a seasonal basis during prolonged multi-day
   hibernation. Recently, a few Madagascar lemur species have been
   identified as the only primates that exhibit torpor; one of these is the
   gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). To explore the regulatory
   mechanisms that underlie daily torpor in a primate, we analyzed the
   expression of 28 selected genes that represent crucial survival pathways
   known to be involved in squirrel and bat hibernation. Array-based
   real-time PCR was used to compare gene expression in control (aroused)
   versus torpid lemurs in five tissues including the liver, kidney,
   skeletal muscle, heart, and brown adipose tissue. Significant
   differences in gene expression during torpor were revealed among genes
   involved in glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, antioxidant defense,
   apoptosis, hypoxia signaling, and protein protection. The results showed
   upregulation of select genes primarily in liver and brown adipose
   tissue. For instance, both tissues showed elevated gene expression of
   peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (ppargc), ferritin
   (fth1), and protein chaperones during torpor. Overall, the data show
   that the expression of only a few genes changed during lemur daily
   torpor, as compared with the broader expression changes reported for
   hibernation in ground squirrels. These results provide an indication
   that the alterations in gene expression required for torpor in lemurs
   are not as extensive as those needed for winter hibernation in squirrel
   models. However, identification of crucial genes with altered expression
   that support lemur torpor provides key targets to be explored and
   manipulated toward a goal of translational applications of inducible
   torpor as a treatment option in human biomedicine.},

Abstract = {Oil was extracted from freeze-dried sardine (Sardinella lemur) fillets
   using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) and a few milliliters of
   ethanol were optimized with response surface methodology (RSM). The
   impact of extraction pressure (200-400 bars) and temperature (40-70
   degrees C) were studied on the total extraction yields, ratios of
   Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The results
   were compared with those of Soxhlet and modified Kinsella methods (MKM).
   The oils obtained using the SC-CO2 and MKM methods were significantly (P
   < 0.05) higher in oil yield (8.04\% and 6.83\%), EPA (5.43\% and 5.45\%)
   and DHA (18.76\% and 18.54\%), respectively, compared to the Soxhlet
   yield (5.10\%), EPA (2.17\%) and DHA (06.46\%). Of the two independent
   variables, pressure had a critical effect on yield while EPA and DHA
   ratios were notably influenced by temperature. The combined optimal
   values were pressure at 328 bars and temperature at 40 degrees C, with
   corresponding responses of 7.20\%, 5.68\% and 20.09\% for yield, EPA and
   DHA, respectively. The experimental values in this study were reasonably
   comparable to their predicted counterparts.},

Title = {Species-Specific Transmission of Novel Picornaviruses in Lemurs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {89},
Number = {7},
Pages = {4002-4010},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The roles of host genetics versus exposure and contact frequency in
   driving cross-species transmission remain the subject of debate. Here,
   we used a multitaxon lemur collection at the Saint Louis Zoo in the
   United States as a model to gain insight into viral transmission in a
   setting of high interspecies contact. Lemurs are a diverse and
   understudied group of primates that are highly endangered. The
   speciation of lemurs, which are endemic to the island of Madagascar,
   occurred in geographic isolation apart from that of continental African
   primates. Although evidence of endogenized viruses in lemur genomes
   exists, no exogenous viruses of lemurs have been described to date. Here
   we identified two novel picornaviruses in fecal specimens of ring-tailed
   lemurs (Lemur catta) and black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia
   variegata). We found that the viruses were transmitted in a
   species-specific manner (lesavirus 1 was detected only in ring-tailed
   lemurs, while lesavirus 2 was detected only in black-and-white ruffed
   lemurs). Longitudinal sampling over a 1-year interval demonstrated
   ongoing infection in the collection. This was supported by evidence of
   viral clearance in some animals and new infections in previously
   uninfected animals, including a set of newly born triplets that acquired
   the infection. While the two virus strains were found to be
   cocirculating in a mixed-species exhibit of ring-tailed lemurs,
   black-and-white ruffed lemurs, and black lemurs, there was no evidence
   of cross-species transmission. This suggests that despite high-intensity
   contact, host species barriers can prevent cross-species transmissions
   of these viruses.
   IMPORTANCE
   Up to 75\% of emerging infectious diseases in humans today are the
   result of zoonotic transmission. However, a challenge in understanding
   transmission dynamics has been the limited models of cross-species
   transmission. Zoos provide a unique opportunity to explore parameters
   defining viral transmission. We demonstrated that ongoing virus
   transmission in a mixed lemur species exhibit was species specific. This
   suggests that despite high contact intensity, host species barriers
   contribute to protection from cross-species transmission of these
   viruses. While the combinations of species might differ, most zoological
   parks worldwide commonly feature mixed-species exhibits. Collectively,
   this report demonstrates a widely applicable approach toward
   understanding infectious disease transmission.},

Abstract = {The polymorphism of immunogenes of the major histocompatibility complex
   (MHC) is thought to influence the functional plasticity of immune
   responses and, consequently, the fitness of populations facing
   heterogeneous pathogenic pressures. Here, we evaluated MHC variation
   (allelic richness and divergence) and patterns of selection acting on
   the two highly polymorphic MHC class II loci (DRB and DQB) in the
   endangered primate Madame Berthe's mouse lemur (Microcebus berthae).
   Using 454 pyrosequencing, we examined MHC variation in a total of 100
   individuals sampled over 9 years in Kirindy Forest, Western Madagascar,
   and compared our findings with data obtained previously for its
   sympatric congener, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). These
   species exhibit a contrasting ecology and demography that were expected
   to affect MHC variation and molecular signatures of selection. We found
   a lower allelic richness concordant with its low population density, but
   a similar level of allelic divergence and signals of historical
   selection in the rare feeding specialist M. berthae compared to the
   widespread generalist M. murinus. These findings suggest that
   demographic factors may exert a stronger influence than pathogen-driven
   selection on current levels of allelic richness in M. berthae. Despite a
   high sequence similarity between the two congeners, contrasting
   selection patterns detected at DQB suggest its potential functional
   divergence. This study represents a first step toward unravelling
   factors influencing the adaptive divergence of MHC genes between closely
   related but ecologically differentiated sympatric lemurs and opens new
   questions regarding potential functional discrepancy that would explain
   contrasting selection patterns detected at DQB.},

Title = {The effects of environmental education on children's and parents'

Abstract = {Environmental education is widely used to increase awareness of
   conservation issues. The theory is that increasing knowledge will
   improve attitudes towards the environment. Often, environmental
   education is aimed at children with the assumption that this can also
   impact adults through intergenerational transfer of knowledge and
   attitudes. However, there are few detailed studies evaluating the
   effectiveness of environmental education on changing knowledge and
   attitudes, and whether any changes do transfer between generations. We
   evaluate the effect of a school-based education programme run by
   Malagasy researchers aimed at promoting lemur conservation in Eastern
   Madagascar. We assess changes in the knowledge and attitudes of
   participating children and their parents (surveying 126 children and 88
   parents across four matched villages, 1 year after two of the villages
   received environmental education). There was very low awareness of the
   law protecting lemurs. Attitudes towards lemurs varied between species;
   with the aye-aye (considered scary) and the eastern lesser bamboo lemur
   (considered a pest) being less preferred. Children in villages who
   received environmental education had higher knowledge about lemurs and
   more positive attitudes than children in the villages not exposed to the
   environmental education. Knowledge about lemurs among parents where
   children had received environmental education was also higher (although
   not attitudes). Environmental education programmes can have a lasting
   effect, certainly on knowledge, but engagement of the research and NGO
   community is needed to build the capacity of teachers in rural areas to
   enthuse their pupils about ecology and conservation issues.},

Abstract = {Gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) from Madagascar present an
   excellent model for studies of torpor regulation in a primate species.
   In the present study, we analyzed the response of the insulin signaling
   pathway as well as controls on carbohydrate sparing in six different
   tissues of torpid versus aroused gray mouse lemurs. We found that the
   relative level of phospho-insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) was
   significantly increased in muscle, whereas the level of phospho-insulin
   receptor (IR) was decreased in white adipose tissue (WAT) of torpid
   animals, both suggesting an inhibition of insulin/insulin-like growth
   factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling during torpor in these tissues. By contrast,
   the level of phospho-IR was increased in the liver. Interestingly,
   muscle, WAT, and liver occupy central roles in whole body homeostasis
   and each displays regulatory controls operating at the plasma membrane.
   Changes in other tissues included an increase in phosphoglycogen
   synthase kinase 3 alpha (GSK3 alpha) and decrease in phospho-ribosomal
   protein S6 (RPS6) in the heart, and a decrease in phospho-mammalian
   target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the kidney. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)
   that gates carbohydrate entry into mitochondria is inhibited via
   phosphorylation by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (e.g., PDK4). In the
   skeletal muscle, the protein expression of PDK4 and phosphorylated PDH
   at Ser 300 was increased, suggesting inhibition during torpor. In
   contrast, there were no changes in levels of PDH expression and
   phosphorylation in other tissues comparing torpid and aroused animals.
   Information gained from these studies highlight the molecular controls
   that help to regulate metabolic rate depression and balance energetics
   during primate torpor.},

Abstract = {During food shortages, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) of
   Madagascar experiences daily torpor thereby reducing energy
   expenditures. The present study aimed to understand the impacts of
   torpor on the immune system and antioxidant response in the gut of these
   animals. This interaction may be of critical importance given the
   trade-off between the energetically costly immune response and the need
   to defend against pathogen entry during hypometabolism. The protein
   levels of cytokines and antioxidants were measured in the small
   intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) and large intestine of aroused
   and torpid lemurs. While there was a significant decrease of some
   pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) in the duodenum and
   jejunum during torpor as compared to aroused animals, there was no
   change in anti-inflammatory cytokines. We observed decreased levels of
   cytokines (IL-12p70 and M-CSF), and several chemokines (MCP-1 and MIP-2)
   but an increase in MIP-1 alpha in the jejunum of the torpid animals. In
   addition, we evaluated antioxidant response by examining the protein
   levels of antioxidant enzymes and total antioxidant capacity provided by
   metabolites such as glutathione (and others). Our results indicated that
   levels of antioxidant enzymes did not change between torpor and aroused
   states, although antioxidant capacity was significantly higher in the
   ileum during torpor. These data suggest a suppression of the immune
   response, likely as an energy conservation measure, and a limited role
   of antioxidant defenses in supporting torpor in lemur intestine.},

Abstract = {A natural tolerance of various environmental stresses is typically
   supported by various cytoprotective mechanisms that protect
   macromolecules and promote extended viability. Among these are
   antioxidant defenses that help to limit damage from reactive oxygen
   species and chaperones that help to minimize protein misfolding or
   unfolding under stress conditions. To understand the molecular
   mechanisms that act to protect cells during primate torpor, the present
   study characterizes antioxidant and heat shock protein (HSP) responses
   in various organs of control (aroused) and torpid gray mouse lemurs,
   Microcebus murinus. Protein expression of HSP70 and HSP90 alpha was
   elevated to 1.26 and 1.49 fold, respectively, in brown adipose tissue
   during torpor as compared with control animals, whereas HSP60 in liver
   of torpid animals was 1.15 fold of that in control (P < 0.05). Among
   antioxidant enzymes, protein levels of thioredoxin 1 were elevated to
   2.19 fold in white adipose tissue during torpor, whereas Cu-Zn
   superoxide dismutase 1 levels rose to 1.1 fold in skeletal muscle (P <
   0.05). Additionally, total antioxidant capacity was increased to 1.6
   fold in liver during torpor (P < 0.05), while remaining unchanged in the
   five other tissues. Overall, our data suggest that antioxidant and HSP
   responses are modified in a tissue-specific manner during daily torpor
   in gray mouse lemurs. Furthermore, our data also show that
   cytoprotective strategies employed during primate torpor are distinct
   from the strategies in rodent hibernation as reported in previous
   studies.},

Abstract = {The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is one of few primate species
   that is able to enter daily torpor or prolonged hibernation in response
   to environmental stresses. With an emerging significance to human health
   research, lemurs present an optimal model for exploring molecular
   adaptations that regulate primate hypometabolism. A fundamental
   challenge is how to effectively regulate energy expensive cellular
   processes (e.g., transcription and translation) during transitions
   to/from torpor without disrupting cellular homeostasis. One such
   regulatory mechanism is reversible posttranslational modification of
   selected protein targets that offers fine cellular control without the
   energetic burden. This study investigates the role of phosphorylation
   and/or acetylation in regulating key factors involved in energy
   homeostasis (AMP-activated protein kinase, or AMPK, signaling pathway),
   mRNA translation (eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha or eIF2 alpha,
   eukaryotic initiation factor 4E or eIF4E, and initiation factor 4E
   binding protein or 4EBP), and gene transcription (histone H3) in six
   tissues of torpid and aroused gray mouse lemurs. Our results indicated
   selective tissue-specific changes of these regulatory proteins. The
   relative level of Thr172-phosphorylated AMPK alpha was significantly
   elevated in the heart but reduced in brown adipose tissue during daily
   torpor, as compared to the aroused lemurs, implicating the regulation of
   AMPK activity during daily torpor in these tissues. Interestingly, the
   levels of the phosphorylated eIFs were largely unaltered between aroused
   and torpid animals. Phosphorylation and acetylation of histone H3 were
   examined as a marker for transcriptional regulation. Compared to the
   aroused lemurs, level of Ser10-phosphorylated histone H3 decreased
   significantly in white adipose tissue during torpor, suggesting global
   suppression of gene transcription. However, a significant increase in
   acetyl-histone H3 in the heart of torpid lemurs indicated a possible
   stimulation of transcriptional activity of this tissue. Overall, our
   study demonstrates that AMPK signaling and posttranslational regulation
   of selected proteins may play crucial roles in the control of
   transcription/translation during daily torpor in mouse lemurs.},

Abstract = {As human population density continues to increase exponentially,
   speeding the reduction and fragmentation of primate habitat, greater
   human-primate contact is inevitable, making higher rates of pathogen
   transmission likely. Anthropogenic effects are particularly evident in
   Madagascar, where a diversity of endemic lemur species are threatened by
   rapid habitat loss. Despite these risks, knowledge of how anthropogenic
   activities affect lemur exposure to pathogens is limited. To improve our
   understanding of this interplay, we non-invasively examined six species
   of wild lemurs in Ranomafana National Park for enteric bacterial
   pathogens commonly associated with diarrheal disease in human
   populations in Madagascar. Patterns of infection with Enterotoxigenic
   Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella enterica, Vibrio cholerae,
   and Yersinia spp. (enterocolitica and pseudotuberculosis) were compared
   between lemurs inhabiting intact forest and lemurs inhabiting degraded
   habitat with frequent exposure to tourism and other human activity.
   Fecal samples acquired from humans, livestock, and rodents living near
   the degraded habitat were also screened for these bacteria. Remarkably,
   only lemurs living in disturbed areas of the park tested positive for
   these pathogens. Moreover, all of these pathogens were present in the
   human, livestock, and/or rodent populations. These data suggest that
   lemurs residing in forests altered or frequented by people, livestock,
   or peridomestic rodents, are at risk for infection by these
   diarrhea-causing enterobacteria and other similarly transmitted
   pathogens. Am. J. Primatol. 77:330-337, 2015. (c) 2014 Wiley

Title = {Transitive Inference in Two Lemur Species (Eulemur macaco and Eulemur

Abstract = {When confronted with tasks involving reasoning instead of simple
   learning through trial and error, lemurs appeared to be less competent
   than simians. Our study aims to investigate lemurs' capability for
   transitive inference, a form of deductive reasoning in which the subject
   deduces logical conclusions from preliminary information. Transitive
   inference may have an adaptative function, especially in species living
   in large, complex social groups and is proposed to play a major role in
   rank estimation and establishment of dominance hierarchies. We proposed
   to test the capacities of reasoning using transitive inference in two
   species of lemurs, the brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus) and the black lemur
   (Eulemur macaco), both living in multimale-multifemale societies. For
   that purpose, we designed an original setup providing, for the first
   time in this kind of cognitive task, pictures of conspecifics' faces as
   stimuli. Subjects were trained to differentiate six photographs of
   unknown conspecifics named randomly from A to F to establish the order
   A>B>C>D>E>F and select consistently the highest-ranking photograph in
   five adjacent pairs AB, BC, CD, DE, and EF. Then lemurs were presented
   with the same adjacent pairs and three new and non-adjacent pairs BD,
   BE, CE. The results showed that all subjects correctly selected the
   highest-ranking photograph in every non-adjacent pair, reflecting
   lemurs' capacity for transitive inference. Our results are discussed in
   the context of the still debated current theories about the mechanisms
   underlying this specific capacity. Am. J. Primatol. 77:338-345, 2015.

Abstract = {Aside from having an important ecological role in the ocean food web,
   small pelagic fishes have become the major food source in the
   Sulu-Celebes Sea (SCS) which is bordered by Indonesia, Malaysia and the
   Philippines. Conservation and management of these fishes are of prime
   importance because the people living around the SCS are highly dependent
   on these resources. Nevertheless, basic biological information,
   especially relating to genetic diversity, population genetic structure,
   and demographic patterns, are often deficient. In this study, population
   genetic methods were used to investigate the genetic structure and
   diversity as well as historical demography of four ecologically and
   economically important small pelagic fishes in the SCS: Auxis thazard
   (Lacepede, 1800); Bali sardine, Sardinella lemuru (Bleeker, 1853);
   Indian mackerel, Rastrelliger kanagurta (Cuvier, 1816); and bigeye scad,
   Selar crumenophthalmus (Bloch, 1793), Fish samples were collected from 5
   geographic locations: (Philippines: Zamboanga, Tawi-Tawi and Palawan;
   Indonesia: Manado; and Malaysia: Kudat) around the SCS and muscle
   tissues were sequenced for the mitochondrial DNA (D-loop) control region
   (n = 150, 231, 169 and 224 for AT, SL, RK, and SC, respectively). Low
   overall F-ST values, high haplotype diversity but low genetic
   differentiation among haplotypes, and highly mixed clusters from BAPS
   analysis indicate no distinct genetic population structuring among the
   samples. Furthermore, neutrality tests, mismatch analysis and Bayesian
   skyline plots suggest population expansion for all species. Generally,
   these results indicate that the four marine pelagic species are very
   resilient over evolutionary time scales; yet, proper management is very
   necessary, especially because overexploitation of small pelagic fishes
   has already been reported in the SCS region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Diversity and Prevalence of Diarrhea-Associated Viruses in the Lemur

Abstract = {Diarrhea-associated viruses are common causes of morbidity in humans in
   developing countries; however, they have seldom been studied in wild
   primates despite their pathogenic and zoonotic potential. This is of
   particular concern in Madagascar, one of the world's poorest and most
   biodiverse countries. To improve our understanding of
   diarrhea-associated viruses in human and nonhuman wild primates in
   Madagascar, we noninvasively collected fecal samples from 7 of the 12
   lemur species of Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar and concurrently
   sampled humans living in proximity to the lemurs. We used standard
   molecular techniques to screen 84 lemur and 107 human samples for viral
   groups commonly associated with diarrheal disease in human populations:
   adenovirus, enterovirus, rotavirus, and norovirus (genogroups GI and
   GII). Of the seven lemur taxa examined, all were positive for one or
   more viral group and humans were positive for all viral groups.
   Norovirus GII was the most common, found in 27 \% of lemurs and 37 \% of
   humans, followed by adenovirus, found in 25 \% of lemurs and 35 \% of
   humans. The high prevalence (30-50 \%) of most viral groups in mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus rufus) highlights their potential to serve as
   sentinals of pathogen spillover from humans to wild lemur populations.
   These results improve our understanding of the diversity and prevalence
   of key viral taxa in lemur and associated human populations. Further
   characterization of these viral group sequences has the potential to
   reveal novel viruses in lemurs and humans in Madagascar and would be
   needed to determine the zoonotic potential of the viruses detected.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 9},
Abstract = {Owing to a similar cerebral neuro-anatomy, non-human primates are viewed
   as the most valid models for understanding cognitive deficits. This
   study evaluated psychomotor and rnnesic functions of 41 young to old
   mouse lemurs (Microcebus munnus). Psychomotor capacities and anxiety
   related behaviors decreased abruptly from middle to late adulthood.
   However, mnesic functions were not affected in the same way with
   increasing age. While results of the spontaneous alternation task point
   to a progressive and widespread age-related decline of spatial working
   memory, both spatial reference and novel object recognition (NOR) memory
   tasks did not reveal any tendency due to large inter individual
   variability in the middle-aged and old animals. Indeed, some of the aged
   animals performed as well as younger ones, whereas some others had bad
   performances in the Barnes maze and in the object recognition test.
   Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that declarativelike memory was
   strongly impaired only in 7 out of 25 middle-aged/old animals. These
   results suggest that this analysis allows to distinguish elder
   populations of good and bad performers in this non-human primate model
   and to closely compare this to human aging.},

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {86},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {25-34},
Abstract = {Although Lemur catta persists in many habitat types in southern
   Madagascar, its ecology has been primarily studied within gallery
   forests. We compare plant food selection and properties for ring-tailed
   lemurs in the spiny and gallery forests over the synchronized lactation
   period (September to March) that includes both the dry and wet seasons.
   We found no significant habitat-specific differences in the type of
   plant part consumed per month (i.e. flower, fruit, leaf) or between the
   intake of soluble carbohydrates. However, the presence and use of
   Tamarindus indica plants appear to elevate protein and fiber intake in
   the gallery forest lemurs' diets. Protein is especially important for
   reproductive females who incur the added metabolic costs associated with
   lactation; however, fiber can disrupt protein digestion. Future work
   should continue to investigate how variations of protein and fiber
   affect ring-tailed lemur dietary choice and nutrient acquisition. (C)

Abstract = {The senses involved in food detection in primates in general, and lemurs
   in particular, remain poorly investigated. However, as lemurs include
   diurnal, nocturnal, and cathemeral species they represent a good model
   to test whether prey detection is dependent on activity pattern. As both
   diurnal and nocturnal species have been investigated previously we here
   aim to quantify the relative importance of different sensory modalities
   during prey detection in a cathemeral species, the red-bellied lemur
   (Eulemeur rubriventer). A series of experiments was performed using a
   group of four Eulemur rubriventer (Zoo de La Londe les Maures, France)
   to test the role of visual, olfactory and acoustic cues in prey
   detection. Both unimodal and multimodal cues were tested. The responses
   obtained in the different experiments show that visual cues are
   essential for prey detection in this species, at least in captivity.
   However, the use of multiple sensory modalities improves the success of
   detection suggesting that cathemeral species may benefit from the use of
   multiple sensory modalities.},

Abstract = {Sardine (Sardinella lemuru) fish canning industries produce oil waste
   that can be potentially reused because of its omega-3 content. However,
   the majority of the omega-3 content are still bound to triacylglyceride
   form. The objective of this study is to determine optimum pH and
   temperature of hydrolysis process using lipase of whole-cell biocatalyst
   Mucor circinelloides immobilized in Poly-Urethane Foam (PUF). The
   optimum hydrolysis products were obtained at pH 7 and temperature 35
   degrees C. The hydrolysis product at the optimum condition was
   fractionated using Thin Layer Chromatograpy (TLC). For further analysis,
   every fraction was extracted and esterified using Fatty Acid Methyl
   Ester (FAME) method. Fatty acid methyl ester were analyzed using Gas
   Chromatography (GC) to determine the omega-3 content. After hydolysis,
   GC result showed an increase in omega-3 (EPA and DHA) content as much as
   12.56 \% compared to the crude oil. However, total lipid was reduced,
   presumably by lipid consumption activity of fungus during the hydrolysis
   process, resulting in the lost of more than 80 \% of total lipid in oil
   waste. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {The health of 36 wild, free-ranging ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) at
   the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve was assessed across 2 habitats of
   varied human impact: a reserve riverine gallery forest, and a degraded
   mixed dry deciduous and Alluaudia-dominated spiny forest. While there
   were no statistically significant differences in leukocyte count or
   differential between habitats, female lemurs in the reserve gallery
   forest had significantly higher percentages of monocytes and eosinophils
   than male lemurs in the gallery forest. Lemurs from the degraded spiny
   habitat had significantly higher mean packed cell volume, hematocrit,
   hemoglobin, total protein, blood urea nitrogen, chloride, ionized
   calcium and urine specific gravity than lemurs from the reserve gallery
   forest. These findings may reflect lower hydration levels in lemurs
   living in degraded habitat, providing evidence that environmental
   degradation has identifiable impacts on the physiology and health of
   wild, free-ranging ring-tailed lemurs living in nearby habitats. Given
   the greater evidence of human impact in the mixed dry deciduous/spiny
   forest habitat, a pattern seen throughout southern Madagascar,
   biomedical markers suggestive of decreased hydration can provide
   empirical data to inform new conservation policies facilitating the
   long-term survival of this lemur community. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {In order to examine auditory thresholds and hearing sensitivity during
   aging in the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), suggested to
   represent a model for early primate evolution and Alzheimer research, we
   applied brainstem-evoked response audiometry (BERA), traditionally used
   for screening hearing sensitivity in human babies. To assess the effect
   of age, we determined auditory thresholds in two age groups of adult
   mouse lemurs (young adults, 1-5 years; old adults, a parts per thousand
   yen7 years) using clicks and tone pips. Auditory thresholds indicated
   frequency sensitivity from 800 Hz to almost 50 kHz, covering the species
   tonal communication range with fundamentals from about 8 to 40 kHz. The
   frequency of best hearing at 7.9 kHz was slightly lower than that and
   coincided with the dominant frequencies of communication signals of a
   predator. Aging shifted auditory thresholds in the range between 2 and
   50.4 kHz significantly by 12-27 dB. This mild presbyacusis, expressed in
   a drop of amplitudes of BERA signals, but not discernible in latencies
   of responses, suggests a metabolic age-related decrease potentially
   combined with an accompanying degeneration of the cochlear nerve. Our
   findings on hearing range of this species support the hypothesis that
   predation was a driving factor for the evolution of hearing in small
   ancestral primates. Likewise, results provide the empirical basis for
   future approaches trying to differentiate peripheral from central
   factors when studying Alzheimer's disease-like pathologies in the aging
   brain.},

Abstract = {The endangered Puerto Rican crested toad (Peltophryne {[}Bufo] lemur)
   has been held and bred in zoos for release into protected areas in
   Puerto Rico since 1982. In 2004, several cases of a novel syndrome of
   skin changes in toads were noticed at the Toronto Zoo. A total of 21
   toads were found to have similar lesions and the condition has been seen
   in several other groups of toads in subsequent years. Affected toads
   show an uncharacteristic sheen of dark-brown leathery skin, followed by
   recurring dysecdysis, reduced appetite, weight loss, and death from
   secondary causes. Histologically the condition is characterized by
   epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis, ulceration, and the presence
   of superficial mats of bacterial and fungal agents. No etiology has been
   identified and to date toads have not permanently responded to treatment
   with various pharmaceutical and nutritional therapies. (C) 2014 Wiley

Title = {Sources of Tooth Wear Variation Early in Life Among Known-Aged Wild

Abstract = {Ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve
   (BMSR), Madagascar display a high frequency of individuals with notable
   and sometimes extreme tooth wear. Adult lemurs display a range of tooth
   wear even among individuals of the same age, but we do not know at what
   age this variation first appears. This study's goal was to determine
   whether wear variation occurs in younger wild lemurs. Based on the
   decade-long study of ring-tailed lemur feeding and dental ecology at
   BMSR, we hypothesized that younger, natal lemurs (under 5 years of age),
   would display variation in their degree of tooth wear that would
   correspond to microhabitat differences, given differences in food
   availability in different troops' home ranges. We also hypothesized that
   wear would differ between sexes at this young age, given differences in
   feeding between males and females in this population. Hypotheses were
   tested using dental topographic analyses using dental impressions
   collected from known-aged lemurs across 10 years at BMSR. Results
   illustrate significant differences in wear-related tooth topography
   (i.e., relief and slope, presented here as occlusal lift) for
   microhabitat, sex and troop affiliation among lemurs under 5 years of
   age in this population. Although, all lemurs in this population consume
   mechanically challenging tamarind fruit, those in more disturbed
   habitats eat additional introduced foods, some of which are also
   mechanically challenging. Thus, dietary variation is the likely cause of
   variation in tooth wear. The wear variation we show at a young age
   suggests caution when assigning age based on tooth wear in living and
   fossil primates. These wear-related tooth shape changes early in life,
   which reflects sex, habitat variation and levels of anthropogenic
   disturbance, may potentially impact reproductive fitness later in life.

Title = {The Effect of Supplementation with Vitamin A on Serum and Liver
   Concentrations in Puerto Rican Crested Toads (Peltophryne lemur) and Its
   Lack of Impact on Brown Skin Disease},

Abstract = {``Brown skin disease{''} (BSD) is a clinical syndrome of dysecdysis,
   chronic weight loss and death, previously reported in Puerto Rican
   crested toads (Peltophryne lemur). Although vitamin A deficiency has
   been suggested, its cause remains unknown and multiple treatments have
   failed to prevent or reverse the condition. This study compared the
   efficacy of vitamin A supplementation, administered in different forms
   and by different routes, in 48 captive born Puerto Rican crested toads
   fed from metamorphosis on gut-loaded, dusted, commercially raised
   crickets. Forty-five toads started to show clinical signs of BSD at 9
   months of age; all toads were treated orally with an oil-based vitamin A
   formulation twice weekly for 2 months but continued to deteriorate. Two
   treatment groups were then compared: Animals in one group (n = 19)
   received 2 IU injectable vitamin A (Aquasol-A) per gram bodyweight
   subcutaneously twice weekly for 3 months with no change in diet. Toads
   in the other group (n = 22) received a single oral dose of vitamins A,
   D-3, and E, and were fed on earthworms and crickets gut-loaded with
   produce and a finely-ground alfalfa-based pellet, dusted with the same
   vitamin/mineral supplement. All affected animals developed severe BSD
   equally and died during, or were euthanized at the end of, the treatment
   regimen, with no clinical improvement. Animals supplemented with
   Aquasol-A had significantly higher liver vitamin A concentrations
   compared with the other treatment group, whereas serum retinol
   concentrations showed no significant difference. Vitamin A
   supplementation does not appear a successful treatment once BSD symptoms
   have developed. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Mouse lemurs are suggested to represent promising novel non-human
   primate models for aging research. However, standardized and cross-taxa
   cognitive testing methods are still lacking. Touchscreen-based testing
   procedures have proven high stimulus control and reliability in humans
   and rodents. The aim of this study was to adapt these procedures to
   mouse lemurs, thereby exploring the effect of age. We measured
   appetitive learning and cognitive flexibility of two age groups by
   applying pairwise visual discrimination (PD) and reversal learning (PDR)
   tasks. On average, mouse lemurs needed 24 days of training before
   starting with the PD task. Individual performances in PD and PDR tasks
   correlate significantly, suggesting that individual learning performance
   is unrelated to the respective task. Compared to the young, aged mouse
   lemurs showed impairments in both PD and PDR tasks. They needed
   significantly more trials to reach the task criteria. A much higher
   inter-individual variation in old than in young adults was revealed.
   Furthermore, in the PDR task, we found a significantly higher
   perseverance in aged compared to young adults, indicating an age-related
   deficit in cognitive flexibility. This study presents the first
   touchscreen-based data on the cognitive skills and age-related
   dysfunction in mouse lemurs and provides a unique basis to study
   mechanisms of inter-individual variation. It furthermore opens exciting
   perspectives for comparative approaches in aging, personality, and
   evolutionary research.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We examine the ecology of reddish-gray mouse lemurs from three habitats
   at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve using focal follows and stable carbon
   and nitrogen isotope data. Focal observations indicate dietary
   differences among habitats as well as sexes and seasons. Both sexes
   consume more arthropods during the rainy season but overall, females
   consume more sugar-rich exudates and fruit than males, and individuals
   from riparian forest consume fewer arthropods and more fruit than those
   in xeric or dry forest. We ask whether these observations are
   isotopically detectable. Isotope data support differences between
   seasons and sexes. Nitrogen isotope values are higher during the rainy
   season when lemurs consume more arthropods, and higher in males than
   females, particularly during the dry season. However, differences among
   populations inferred from focal observations are not fully supported.
   Lemurs from riparian forest have lower isotope values than those in
   xeric scrub, but isotope data suggest that lemurs from the dry forest
   eat the least animal matter and that focal observations overestimated
   dry forest arthropod consumption. Overall, our results suggest that
   observational and isotopic data are complementary. Isotope data can be
   obtained from a larger number of individuals and can quantify ingestion
   of animal matter, but they apparently cannot quantify the relative
   consumption of different sugar-rich foods. Combined focal and isotope
   data provide valuable insight into the dietary constraints of
   reddish-grey mouse lemurs, with implications for their vulnerability to
   future habitat change. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Most anatomical studies of primates focus on skeletal tissues, but
   muscular anatomy can provide valuable information about phylogeny,
   functional specializations, and evolution. Herein, we present the first
   detailed description of the head, neck, pectoral, and upper limb muscles
   of the fetal lemuriforms Lemur catta (Lemuridae) and Propithecus
   coquereli (Indriidae). These two species belong to the suborder
   Strepsirrhini, which is often presumed to possess some plesiomorphic
   anatomical features within primates. We compare the muscular anatomy of
   the fetuses with that of infants and adults and discuss the evolutionary
   and developmental implications. The fetal anatomy reflects a
   phylogenetically more plesiomorphic condition in nine of the muscles we
   studied and a more derived condition in only two, supporting a parallel
   between ontogeny and phylogeny. The derived exceptions concern muscles
   with additional insertions in the fetus which are lost in adults of the
   same species, that is, flexor carpi radialis inserts on metacarpal III
   and levator claviculae inserts on the clavicle. Interestingly, these two
   muscles are involved in movements of the pectoral girdle and upper limb,
   which are mainly important for activities in later stages of life, such
   as locomotion and prey capture, rather than activities in fetal life.
   Accordingly, our findings suggest that some exceptions to the ``ontogeny
   parallels phylogeny{''} rule are probably driven more by ontogenetic
   constraints than by adaptive plasticity. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {In family Lemuridae, anatomical variations exist. Considering its
   conservation status (near threatened) and presence of similarities
   between strepsirrhines and primitive animals, it was thought to be
   beneficial to describe the gross osteology and radiographic anatomy of
   the pelvis and hind limb of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) as a
   reference for clinical use and species identification. Radiography was
   performed in 14 captive adult ring-tailed lemurs. The radiographic
   findings were correlated with bone specimens from two adult animals.
   Additionally, computed tomography of the hind limbs was performed in one
   animal. The pelvic bone has a well-developed caudal ventral iliac spine.
   The patella has a prominent tuberosity on the cranial surface. The first
   metatarsal bone and digit 1 are markedly stouter than the other
   metatarsal bones and digits with medial divergence from the rest of the
   metatarsal bones and digits. Ossicles were seen in the lateral meniscus,
   inter-phalangeal joint of digit 1 and in the infrapatellar fat pad.
   Areas of mineral opacity were seen within the external genitalia, which
   are believed to be the os penis and os clitoris. Variations exist in the
   normal osteology and radiographic appearance of the pelvis and hind limb
   of different animal species. The use of only atlases from domestic cats
   and dogs for interpretative purposes may be misleading.},

Abstract = {Folivorous primate biomass has been shown to positively correlate with
   the average protein-to-fiber ratio in mature leaves of tropical forests.
   However, studies have failed to explain the mismatch between dietary
   selection and the role of the protein-to-fiber ratio on primate biomass;
   why do not folivores always favor mature leaves or leaves with the
   highest protein-to-fiber ratio? We examined the effect of leaf chemical
   characteristics and plant abundance (using transect censuses; 0.37ha,
   233 trees) on food choices and nutrient/toxin consumption in a
   folivorous lemur (Propithecus verreauxi) in a gallery forest in southern
   Madagascar. To assess the nutritional quality of the habitat, we
   calculated an abundance-weighted chemical index for each chemical
   variable. Food intake was quantified using a continuous count of
   mouthfuls during individual full-day follows across three seasons. We
   found a significant positive correlation between food ranking in the
   diet and plant abundance. The protein-to-fiber ratio and most other
   chemical variables tested had no statistical effect on dietary
   selection. Numerous chemical characteristics of the sifaka's diet were
   essentially by-products of generalist feeding and low energy input/low
   energy crop strategy. The examination of feeding behavior and plant
   chemistry in Old World colobines and folivorous prosimians in Madagascar
   suggests that relative lack of feeding selectivity and high primate
   biomass occur when the average protein-to-fiber ratio of mature leaves
   in the habitat exceeds a threshold at 0.4. Am. J. Primatol. 76:563-575,

Abstract = {Primates often modify dietary composition in relation to seasonal
   changes in food availability or climate conditions. We studied the
   feeding patterns of a troop of common brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus), a
   semi-frugivorous strepsirhine, in a dry forest in northwestern
   Madagascar. To understand the mechanism of dietary modification, we
   recorded daily feeding times of diet items during 101 full-day
   observations over 1 year, and then conducted a linear model analysis to
   examine the effects of fruiting tree density in the forest, daily
   ambient temperature, and weekly rainfall (index of water retained in the
   forest) on the lemurs' daily feeding time. The lemurs spent dramatically
   more time on leaf-eating as well as total feeding time, and less time on
   fruit-eating during the late dry season (total 152 min/day, frugivory 56
   min/day, folivory 77 min/day), as compared with other seasons when the
   diet was highly frugivorous (total 96 min/day, frugivory 81 min/day,
   folivory 8 min/day). Folivory increased as temperatures rose under the
   condition of low weekly rainfall, whereas frugivory was unrelated to
   fruiting tree density. Most (97.4 \%) diurnal folivory during the late
   dry season was spent consuming Lissochilus rutenbergianus, chewing the
   succulent leaves and licking the juice. Because the nutritional analysis
   showed that L. rutenbergianus is rich in water (80.1 \% of fresh weight)
   but poor in protein and nonstructural carbohydrates, its increased use
   was probably for rehydration. We conducted 13 full-night observations,
   because brown lemurs increase nocturnal activities during the dry
   season. At nighttime, the lemurs tended to spend more time eating fruit
   in the late dry season (32 min/night) than in the early dry season (14
   min/night), and never consumed L. rutenbergianus. Fruits rich in
   nonstructural carbohydrates can be energy sources for Eulemur. They
   likely engaged in additional nocturnal frugivory for energy
   compensation. Brown lemurs have a flexible strategy of modifying their
   diet and feeding activities to cope with environmental stresses.},

Abstract = {The grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is a non-human primate used to
   study the ageing process. Resveratrol is a polyphenol that may increase
   lifespan by delaying age-associated pathologies. However, no information
   about resveratrol absorption and metabolism is available for this
   primate. Resveratrol and its metabolites were qualitatively and
   quantitatively analyzed in male mouse-lemur plasma (after 200 mg.kg(-1)
   of oral resveratrol) by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography
   (UHPLC), coupled to a quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass
   spectrometer used in full-scan mode. Data analyses showed, in MSE mode,
   an ion common to resveratrol and all its metabolites: m/z 227.072, and
   an ion common to dihydro-resveratrol metabolites: m/z 229.08. A
   semi-targeted study enabled us to identify six hydrophilic resveratrol
   metabolites (one diglucurono-conjugated, two monoglucurono-conjugated,
   one monosulfo-conjugated and two both sulfo-and glucurono-conjugated
   derivatives) and three hydrophilic metabolites of dihydro-resveratrol
   (one monoglucurono- conjugated, one monosulfo-conjugated, and one both
   sulfo-and glucurono-conjugated derivatives). The presence of such
   metabolites has been already detected in the mouse, rat, pig, and
   humans. Free resveratrol was measurable for several hours in mouse-lemur
   plasma, and its two main metabolites were
   trans-resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide and trans-resveratrol-3-sulfate. Free
   dihydro-resveratrol was not measurable whatever the time of plasma
   collection, while its hydrophilic metabolites were present at 24 h after
   intake. These data will help us interpret the effect of resveratrol in
   mouse lemurs and provide further information on the inter-species
   characteristics of resveratrol metabolism.},

Title = {Modeling the origins of mammalian sociality: moderate evidence for
   matrilineal signatures in mouse lemur vocalizations},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Introduction: Maternal kin selection is a driving force in the evolution
   of mammalian social complexity and it requires that kin are distinctive
   from nonkin. The transition from the ancestral state of asociality to
   the derived state of complex social groups is thought to have occurred
   via solitary foraging, in which individuals forage alone, but, unlike
   the asocial ancestors, maintain dispersed social networks via
   scent-marks and vocalizations. We hypothesize that matrilineal
   signatures in vocalizations were an important part of these networks. We
   used the solitary foraging gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) as a
   model for ancestral solitary foragers and tested for matrilineal
   signatures in their calls, thus investigating whether such signatures
   are already present in solitary foragers and could have facilitated the
   kin selection thought to have driven the evolution of increased social
   complexity in mammals. Because agonism can be very costly, selection for
   matrilineal signatures in agonistic calls should help reduce agonism
   between unfamiliar matrilineal kin. We conducted this study on a
   well-studied population of wild mouse lemurs at Ankarafantsika National
   Park, Madagascar. We determined pairwise relatedness using seven
   microsatellite loci, matrilineal relatedness by sequencing the
   mitrochondrial D-loop, and sleeping group associations using
   radio-telemetry. We recorded agonistic calls during controlled social
   encounters and conducted a multi-parametric acoustic analysis to
   determine the spectral and temporal structure of the agonistic calls. We
   measured 10 calls for each of 16 females from six different matrilineal
   kin groups.
   Results: Calls were assigned to their matriline at a rate significantly
   higher than chance (pDFA: correct = 47.1\%, chance = 26.7\%, p = 0.03).
   There was a statistical trend for a negative correlation between
   acoustic distance and relatedness (Mantel Test: g = -1.61, Z = 4.61, r =
   -0.13, p = 0.058).
   Conclusions: Mouse lemur agonistic calls are moderately distinctive by
   matriline. Because sleeping groups consisted of close maternal kin, both
   genetics and social learning may have generated these acoustic
   signatures. As mouse lemurs are models for solitary foragers, we
   recommend further studies testing whether the lemurs use these calls to
   recognize kin. This would enable further modeling of how kin recognition
   in ancestral species could have shaped the evolution of complex
   sociality.},

Abstract = {Case Description-A 16-year-old vasectomized male ring-tailed lemur
   (Lemur catta) with a history of suspected chronic renal failure was
   evaluated because of extreme lethargy, hyperpnea, and abscess of the
   right pectoral scent gland.
   Clinical Findings-Examination of the anesthetized patient revealed an
   impacted right pectoral scent gland with serosanguineous exudate. A CBC
   and serum biochemical analysis revealed severe anemia, marked azotemia,
   hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia.
   Treatment and Outcome-Supportive care (including fluid therapy and
   phosphorus binder administration) was initiated for renal failure; the
   affected gland was cleaned, and antimicrobials were administered. The
   patient received 1 blood transfusion, and darbepoetin alfa was
   administered weekly to stimulate RBC production. Anemia and azotemia
   persisted. Three months after treatment started, serum iron analysis
   revealed that iron deficiency was the probable cause for the lack of a
   consistent regenerative response to darbepoetin injections. Iron dextran
   injections resulted in a marked regenerative response; however, serum
   biochemical analysis results after the second injection were consistent
   with hepatic injury. Hepatic enzyme activities normalized following
   discontinuation of iron dextran treatment, but the lemur's Hct declined
   rapidly despite supplementary iron administration PO. The patient
   developed severe mandibular osteomyelitis and was euthanized because of
   poor prognosis. Postmortem evaluation of hepatic iron concentration
   confirmed iron deficiency.
   Clinical Relevance-The family Lemuridae is considered prone to
   hemosiderosis and hemochromatosis, which delayed rapid diagnosis and
   treatment of the lemur's disease. Apparent hepatic injury following iron
   dextran injections further complicated treatment. Findings for this
   lemur support the use of species-specific total iron binding capacity
   and total serum iron and ferritin concentrations in evaluation of an
   animal with suspected iron deficiency.},

Abstract = {A 10-y-old ovariohysterectomized ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) was
   presented for exacerbation of respiratory signs. The lemur had a history
   of multiple examinations for various problems, including traumatic
   lacerations and recurrent perivulvar dermatitis. Examination revealed
   abnormal lung sounds and a femoral arteriovenous fistula with a palpable
   thrill and auscultable bruit in the right inguinal area. A diagnosis of
   congestive heart failure was made on the basis of exam findings,
   radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, and echocardiography. The lemur
   was maintained on furosemide until surgical ligation of the fistula was
   performed. Postoperative examination confirmed successful closure of the
   fistula and resolution of the signs of heart failure. Arteriovenous
   fistulas are abnormal connections between an artery and a vein that
   bypass the capillary bed. Large arteriovenous fistulas may result in
   decreased peripheral resistance and an increase in cardiac output with
   consequent cardiomegaly and high output heart failure. This lemur's
   high-flow arteriovenous fistula with secondary heart failure may have
   been iatrogenically induced during blood collection by prior femoral
   venipuncture. To our knowledge, this report is the first description of
   an arteriovenous fistula in a prosimian. Successful surgical correction
   of suspected iatrogenic femoral arteriovenous fistulas in a cynomolgus
   monkey (Macaca fascicularis) and a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) have
   been reported previously. Arteriovenous fistula formation should be
   considered as a rare potential complication of venipuncture and as a
   treatable cause of congestive heart failure in lemurs.},

Abstract = {Humans primarily rely on vision when categorizing the world. If you just
   look at the same-sized but strikingly differently colored Neotropical
   poison-dart frogs such as strawberry frogs (Fig. ), you would be
   convinced that they must belong to different species. However, this is
   an excellent example of a polymorphic species, meaning that although
   these frogs look quite different, mating decisions are made based on
   their conspicuous and species-specific advertisements calls, which are
   not primarily linked to specific color pattern. The situation is quite
   different among nocturnal primates living in dense forest environments,
   such as the tiny nocturnal Malagasy mouse lemurs. In this case, even
   geographically isolated, well-accepted species look superficially quite
   similar and are therefore often termed cryptic species (Fig. ). Some
   morphs are a bit larger than others or show minor phenotypic
   differences, but morph-specific differences are difficult to detect in
   living subjects. This phenomenon explains why, until the end of the last
   century, species diversity in mouse lemurs was assumed to be low, with
   only two morphologically distinct species. Over the last two decades,
   several international working groups, including our own, undertook a
   massive island-wide sampling effort, including DNA sequencing and
   phylogenetic analyses of mouse lemurs. These revealed a 10-fold higher
   species diversity, with 21 currently described species. Are these new
   species, mostly defined based on the phylogenetic species concept (sensu
   Cracraft), or independent evolutionary lineages or, perhaps, only
   artifacts of taxonomic inflation? What is a species? How can we identify
   primate species? How and why do species emerge during evolution?

Title = {Evaluating capture stress in wild gray mouse lemurs via repeated fecal
   sampling: Method validation and the influence of prior experience and
   handling protocols on stress responses},
Journal = {GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {195},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Reliable measurements of physiological stress are increasingly needed
   for eco-physiological research and for species conservation or
   management. Stress can be estimated by quantifying plasma glucocorticoid
   levels, but when this is not feasible, glucocorticoid metabolites are
   often measured from feces (FGCM). However, evidence is accumulating on
   the sensitivity of FGCM measurements to various nuisance factors.
   Careful species- and context-specific validations are therefore
   necessary to confirm the biological relevance and specificity of the
   method. The goals of this study were to: (1) establish and validate
   sampling methods and an enzymeimmunoassay to measure FGCM in the gray
   mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus); (2) explore causes of variability in
   the FGCM measurements, and; (3) assess the consequences of capturing and
   handling for free-living individuals by quantifying their stress
   responses via repeated fecal sampling within capture sessions. We
   further assessed the influence of different handling protocols and the
   animals' previous capture experience on the magnitude of the
   physiological response. Our validations identified the group-specific
   measurement of 11 beta-hydroxyetiocholanolone as the most suitable assay
   for monitoring adrenocortical activity. The sample water content and the
   animal's age were found to significantly influence baseline FGCM-levels.
   Most captured animals exhibited a post-capture FGCMelevation but its
   magnitude was not related to the handling protocol or capture
   experience. We found no evidence for long-term consequences of routine
   capturing on the animals' stress physiology. Hence the described methods
   can be employed to measure physiological stress in mouse lemurs in an
   effective and relatively non-invasive way. (C) 2013 The Authors.

   the patterns of seed dispersal by Eulemur rubriventer, Eulemur

   Long-distance dispersal (>500m) was rare and average dispersal distances
   were short relative to those reported of similar-sized haplorrhine
   primates. The three lemur species showed no significant differences in
   mean seed-dispersal distances. However, they differed in the shape of
   their frequency distributions of seed-dispersal distances as a result of
   differences in how they moved through their habitats. The short
   distances of seed dispersal we observed and the depauperate frugivorous
   fauna in Madagascar suggest seed-dispersal may be more limited than in
   other tropical forests with important implications for plant-community

Abstract = {The dominant use of one hand is a striking feature of humans, but manual
   lateralization can be found in a variety of other species as well. In
   primates, the lateralization in hand use varies among species and
   several theories such as the postural origin, task complexity, or
   development theory have been suggested to explain this variation. In
   order to contribute comparative data on this phenomenon from a basal
   primate, we studied manual lateralization in wild redfronted lemurs
   (Eulemur rufifrons). Data were collected on four groups at Kirindy
   Forest, western Madagascar, during spontaneous actions and by
   confronting them with artificial feeding boxes. The lemurs did not
   exhibit manual lateralization on a group level in either condition. More
   individuals showed a hand preference in the experimental task, and the
   preferences were stronger compared to spontaneous actions. The direction
   of individual hand preferences was not consistent across the two
   conditions. The results of this study show that measuring manual
   laterality in different contexts can yield different results. Manual
   lateralization in wild redfronted lemurs therefore seems to be flexible
   and situation dependent and probably not ecologically relevant in their
   natural habitat. Am J Phys Anthropol 153:61-67, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley

Title = {Habitat selection and use in the Critically Endangered Sahamalaza
   sportive lemur Lepilemur sahamalazensis in altered habitat},
Journal = {ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {273-286},
Abstract = {Habitat selection and use by primates is influenced by the trade-off
   between distribution of foraging resources and predation risk. So far,
   there are published studies on habitat use for 2 out of 26 sportive
   lemur species, but none document habitat selection. We studied habitat
   in home ranges as well as feeding preferences and nightly activity
   budgets in the Sahamalaza sportive lemur Lepilemur sahamalazensis. We
   describe the habitat structure of home ranges located in 4 forest
   fragments in Madagascar with varying habitat characteristics after
   following 8 radio-tagged individuals for a total of 666 h at night. With
   the limitation of small sample size, our results suggest that Sahamalaza
   sportive lemurs choose the locations of their home ranges on the basis
   of different habitat variables, with abundance of sleeping sites and
   feeding trees as well as tree density and canopy cover being the most
   important factors. The Sahamalaza sportive lemur is a highly folivorous
   generalist herbivore, feeding on at least 42 different tree species and
   preferring the abundant species Clitoria lasciva, Mangifera indica,
   Garcinia pauciflora and Sorindeia madagascariensis. It has prolonged
   times of resting during its activity periods. Our results imply that
   despite its habitat selectivity, even the most degraded fragments on the
   Sahamalaza Peninsula still adequately meet the species' habitat
   requirements. However, the small extent of the remaining forest and
   ongoing deforestation, forest degradation and poaching call the future
   survival of this Critically Endangered species into question.},

   predicts cancer progression and prognosis},
Journal = {MEDICAL ONCOLOGY},
Year = {2013},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3) is a member of the families of
   serine-threonine-tyrosine kinases, which has been suggested to be a
   possible target and marker of breast cancer. However, its definitive
   physiopathological function in colorectal cancer (CRC) is poorly
   understood at present. The aim of this study was to determine the
   expression levels of preoperative-soluble LMTK3 (sLMTK3) in patients'
   blood with CRC and to subsequently evaluate whether or not its level in
   serum can be used to predict cancer progression and prognosis. The
   expression levels of sLMTK3 were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay in blood specimens from 60 patients with CRC and 53
   healthy volunteers. As a result, we found that the mean concentration of
   sKMTK3 in CRC patients was significantly higher than that in healthy
   volunteers (P = 0.012). The expression levels of sLMTK3 were
   significantly correlated with histological subtype, depth of tumor
   invasion, and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification (P = 0.038,
   0.021, and 0.049, respectively), but not with sex, age, tumor location,
   tumor size, or lymph node metastasis. Additionally, Kaplan-Meier
   survival curves showed that patients with high levels of sLMTK3 had a
   poorer overall survival rate when compared with those of patients with
   low levels of sLMTK3 (P = 0.041). Moreover, multivariate analysis
   demonstrated that sLMTK3 expression and TNM stage were independent
   prognostic factors for CRC patients (P = 0.047 and 0.008, respectively).
   These results suggest that serum LMTK3 could be a valuable biomarker for
   predicting the progression and prognosis of patients with CRC.},

Abstract = {Unequal degrees of taxonomic subdivision can pose problems for research
   that relies on cross-taxon comparisons of biogeographic patterns.
   Numerous species of lemurs have been described in recent years. These
   descriptions were unevenly distributed over the genera of lemurs as
   exemplified by the closely related mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) and
   dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus spp.). According to previous studies, these
   genera display striking differences such as many versus few species,
   small versus large distributions, and small versus large mitochondria]
   divergence within and between species. We questioned if these
   differences reflect the biological reality or a biased taxonomic
   subdivision, which might be partially due to relatively small amounts of
   available genetic data from dwarf lemurs. We complemented existing
   datasets with genetic data from 51 dwarf lemurs from nine sites in
   southern Madagascar. We analyzed the mitochondrial cytb gene and the
   nuclear loci adora3, fiba, and vWF. Based on a comparison of
   mitochondria] genetic data from both genera, we delineated eight
   hypothetical subgroups within two recognized Cheirogaleus species. We
   used mitochondrial and nuclear data to reconstruct species trees and to
   estimate divergence times between Microcebus species and Cheirogaleus
   subgroups. We further performed Bayesian species delimitations based on
   nuclear sequence data from Cheirogaleus subgroups. Strong signals in
   mitochondrial and nuclear data indicate the existence of deeply
   divergent, distinct groups within recognized Cheirogaleus species. Based
   on several lines of evidence, we conclude that the species diversity in
   Cheirogaleus has been underestimated so far. We delineate six species
   among the eight subgroups and provide a formal description for one new
   Cheirogaleus species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Phylogeographic analysis of the true lemurs (genus Eulemur) underlines
   the role of river catchments for the evolution of micro-endemism in
   Madagascar},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Introduction: Due to its remarkable species diversity and
   micro-endemism, Madagascar has recently been suggested to serve as a
   biogeographic model region. However, hypothesis-based tests of various
   diversification mechanisms that have been proposed for the evolution of
   the island's micro-endemic lineages are still limited. Here, we test the
   fit of several diversification hypotheses with new data on the broadly
   distributed genus Eulemur using coalescent-based phylogeographic
   analyses.
   Results: Time-calibrated species tree analyses and population genetic
   clustering resolved the previously polytomic species relationships among
   eulemurs. The most recent common ancestor of eulemurs was estimated to
   have lived about 4.45 million years ago (mya). Divergence date estimates
   furthermore suggested a very recent diversification among the members of
   the ``brown lemur complex{''}, i.e. former subspecies of E. fulvus,
   during the Pleistocene (0.33-1.43 mya). Phylogeographic model
   comparisons of past migration rates showed significant levels of gene
   flow between lineages of neighboring river catchments as well as between
   eastern and western populations of the redfronted lemur (E. rufifrons).
   Conclusions: Together, our results are concordant with the centers of
   endemism hypothesis (Wilme et al. 2006, Science 312: 1063-1065),
   highlight the importance of river catchments for the evolution of
   Madagascar's micro-endemic biota, and they underline the usefulness of
   testing diversification mechanisms using coalescent-based
   phylogeographic methods.},

Title = {Evaluation of Non-Invasive Biological Samples to Monitor Staphylococcus
   aureus Colonization in Great Apes and Lemurs},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Introduction: Reintroduction of endangered animals as part of
   conservational programs bears the risk of importing human pathogens from
   the sanctuary to the natural habitat. One bacterial pathogen that serves
   as a model organism to analyze this transmission is Staphylococcus
   aureus as it can colonize and infect both humans and animals. The aim of
   this study was to evaluate the utility of various biological samples to
   monitor S. aureus colonization in great apes and lemurs.
   Methods: Mucosal swabs from wild lemurs (n=25, Kirindy, Madagascar),
   feces, oral and genital swabs from captive chimpanzees (n=58, Ngamba and
   Entebbe, Uganda) and fruit wadges and feces from wild chimpanzees (n=21,
   Ta National Parc, Cote d'Ivoire) were screened for S. aureus.
   Antimicrobial resistance and selected virulence factors were tested for
   each isolate. Sequence based genotyping (spa typing, multilocus sequence
   typing) was applied to assess the population structure of S. aureus.
   Results: Oro-pharyngeal carriage of S. aureus was high in lemurs (72\%,
   n=18) and captive chimpanzees (69.2\%, n=27 and 100\%, n=6,
   respectively). Wild chimpanzees shed S. aureus through feces (43.8, n=7)
   and fruit wadges (54.5, n=12). Analysis of multiple sampling revealed
   that two samples are sufficient to detect those animals which shed S.
   aureus through feces or fruit wadges. Genotyping showed that captive
   animals are more frequently colonized with human-associated S. aureus
   lineages.
   Conclusion: Oro-pharyngeal swabs are useful to screen for S. aureus
   colonization in apes and lemurs before reintroduction. Duplicates of
   stool and fruit wadges reliably detect S. aureus shedding in wild
   chimpanzees. We propose to apply these sampling strategies in future
   reintroduction programs to screen for S. aureus colonization. They may
   also be useful to monitor S. aureus in wild populations.},

Abstract = {Reports on behavioural innovations in wild primate populations as well
   as on their transmission are rare. Here, we report observations
   suggesting that redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) invent new
   behaviours in the wild. We observed a novel feeding behaviour in
   redfronted lemurs in Kirindy Forest, western Madagascar. The feeding
   behaviour consisted of depletion of nests of a social spider species
   (Stegodyphus sp.). The behaviour was observed in only one out of four
   study groups, although spider nests were present in the home ranges of
   all four groups. The behaviour was exhibited in three different years
   (2009, 2011, 2012) and appears to be re-invented from time to time.
   Interestingly, in 2011 this behaviour was shown by four individuals and
   probably spread within the group. This feeding behaviour has only been
   observed between the middle of June and early August (i.e. the early dry
   season), and nests were found to be empty later on, suggesting that
   these nests are available as a food source only seasonally. Our
   observation contributes a rare case of behavioural innovations in a wild
   primate population.},

Abstract = {Increasingly, individual variation in personality has become a focus of
   behavioral research in animal systems. Boldness and shyness, often
   quantified as the tendency to explore novel situations, are seen as
   personality traits important to the fitness landscape of individuals.
   Here we tested for individual differences within and across contexts in
   behavioral responses of captive mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) to
   novel objects, novel foods, and handling. We report consistent
   differences in behavioral responses for objects and handling. We also
   found that the responses to handling and novel objects were correlated
   and repeatable. Lastly, we show that shyer individuals may show less
   variability in their behavioral responses. This study provides new
   information on the potential for behavioral syndromes in this species
   and highlights differences in the degree to which behavioral types
   (e.g., shy/bold) vary in their behavioral responses.},

Abstract = {Lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3) was recently identified as an estrogen
   receptor (ER)-alpha modulator related to endocrine therapy resistance,
   and its polymorphisms rs9989661 (T>C) T/T genotype and rs8108419 (G>A)
   G/G or A/G genotype predicted improved outcomes in breast cancer.
   Because different predominant ER distributions link to breast and
   gastric cancer and little is known of the prognostic role of LMTK3 in
   gastric cancer, this study was carried out to clarify the prognostic
   role of these polymorphisms in gastric cancer. One-hundred and
   sixty-nine Japanese and 137 U.S. patients with localized gastric
   adenocarcinoma were enrolled. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood or
   tissue, and all samples were analyzed by PCR-based direct DNA
   sequencing. Overall, these polymorphisms were not associated with
   survival in both cohorts. When gender was considered, in multivariate
   analysis, harboring rs9989661 T/T genotype was associated with
   disease-free survival {[}HR, 4.37; 95\% confidence interval (CI),
   2.08-9.18; P < 0.0001] and overall survival (OS; HR, 3.69; 95\% CI,
   1.65-8.24; P = 0.0014) in the Japanese males and time to recurrence (HR,
   7.29; 95\% CI, 1.07-49.80; P = 0.043) in the U.S. females. Meanwhile,
   harboring rs8108419 G/G genotype was associated with OS in the Japanese
   females (HR, 3.04; 95\% CI, 1.08-8.56; P = 0.035) and the U.S. males
   (HR, 3.39; 95\% CI, 1.31-8.80; P = 0.012). The prognostic role of these
   polymorphisms may be negative in gastric cancer. These findings suggest
   that the estrogen pathway may play a prognostic role in patients with
   gastric cancer but this may be dependent on the regional differences
   both in physiology and genetic alterations of gastric cancer. (C)2013

Title = {Unconstrained 3D-kinematics of prehension in five primates: Lemur,
   capuchin, gorilla, chimpanzee, human},

Abstract = {Primates are known for their use of the hand in many activities
   including food grasping. Yet, most studies concentrate on the type of
   grip used. Moreover, kinematic studies remain limited to a few
   investigations of the distal elements in constrained conditions in
   humans and macaques. In order to improve our understanding of the
   prehension movement in primates, we analyse here the behavioural
   strategies (e.g., types of grip, body postures) as well as the 3D
   kinematics of the whole forelimb and the trunk during the prehension of
   small static food items in five primate species in unconstrained
   conditions. All species preferred the quadrupedal posture except lemurs,
   which used a typical crouched posture. Grasp type differed among
   species, with smaller animals (capuchins and lemurs) using a whole-hand
   grip and larger animals (humans, gorillas, chimpanzees) using
   predominantly a precision grip. Larger animals had lower relative wrist
   velocities and spent a larger proportion of the movement decelerating.
   Humans grasped food items with planar motions involving small joint
   rotations, more similar to the smaller animals than to gorillas and
   chimpanzees, which used greater rotations of both the shoulder and
   forearm. In conclusion, the features characterising human food
   prehension are present in other primates, yet differences exist in joint
   motions. These results provide a good basis to suggest hypotheses
   concerning the factors involved in driving the evolution of grasping
   abilities in primates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Colour and odour drive fruit selection and seed dispersal by mouse
   lemurs},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Month = {AUG 13},
Abstract = {Animals and fruiting plants are involved in a complex set of
   interactions, with animals relying on fruiting trees as food resources,
   and fruiting trees relying on animals for seed dispersal. This
   interdependence shapes fruit signals such as colour and odour, to
   increase fruit detectability, and animal sensory systems, such as colour
   vision and olfaction to facilitate food identification and selection.
   Despite the ecological and evolutionary importance of plant-animal
   interactions for shaping animal sensory adaptations and plant
   characteristics, the details of the relationship are poorly understood.
   Here we examine the role of fruit chromaticity, luminance and odour on
   seed dispersal by mouse lemurs. We show that both fruit colour and odour
   significantly predict fruit consumption and seed dispersal by Microcebus
   ravelobensis and M. murinus. Our study is the first to quantify and
   examine the role of bimodal fruit signals on seed dispersal in light of
   the sensory abilities of the disperser.},

Title = {Clinal variation in a brown lemur (Eulemur spp.) hybrid zone: Combining

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1677-1690},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Studies of hybrid zones can inform our understanding of reproductive
   isolation and speciation. Two species of brown lemur (Eulemur rufifrons
   and E.cinereiceps) form an apparently stable hybrid zone in the
   Andringitra region of south-eastern Madagascar. The aim of this study
   was to identify factors that contribute to this stability. We sampled
   animals at 11 sites along a 90-km transect through the hybrid zone and
   examined variation in 26 microsatellites, the D-loop region of
   mitochondrial DNA, six pelage and nine morphological traits; we also
   included samples collected in more distant allopatric sites. Clines in
   these traits were noncoincident, and there was no increase in either
   inbreeding coefficients or linkage disequilibrium at the centre of the
   zone. These results could suggest that the hybrid zone is maintained by
   weak selection against hybrids, conforming to either the tension zone or
   geographical selection-gradient model. However, a closer examination of
   clines in pelage and microsatellites indicates that these clines are not
   sigmoid or stepped in shape but instead plateau at their centre. Sites
   within the hybrid zone also occur in a distinct habitat, characterized
   by greater seasonality in precipitation and lower seasonality in
   temperature. Together, these findings suggest that the hybrid zone may
   follow the bounded superiority model, with exogenous selection favouring
   hybrids within the transitional zone. These findings are noteworthy, as
   examples supporting the bounded superiority model are rare and may
   indicate a process of ecologically driven speciation without
   geographical isolation.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {100},
Number = {8},
Pages = {769-777},

Abstract = {Lemurs are the most olfactory-oriented of primates, yet there is still
   only a basic level of understanding of what their scent marks
   communicate. We analyzed scent secretions from Milne-Edwards' sifakas
   (Propithecus edwardsi) collected in their natural habitat of Ranomafana
   National Park, Madagascar. We sought to test whether the scent mark
   could signal genetic relatedness in addition to species, sex, season,
   and individuality. We not only found correlations (r (2) = 0.38, P =
   0.017) between the total olfactory fingerprint and genetic relatedness
   but also between relatedness and specific components of the odor,
   despite the complex environmental signals from differences in diet and
   behavior in a natural setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first demonstration of an association between genetic relatedness and
   chemical communication in a wild primate population. Furthermore, we
   found a variety of compounds that were specific to each sex and each
   sampling period. This research shows that scent marks could act as a
   remote signal to avoid inbreeding, optimize mating opportunities, and
   potentially aid kin selection.},

Abstract = {Understanding the habitat preferences of a species is critical to the
   management and conservation of its population. The Critically Endangered
   greater bamboo lemur, Prolemur simus, is patchily distributed across its
   geographic range, using a very limited fraction of its total area of
   occurrence. The ecological basis for this patchy distribution remains
   largely unexplained. We analyzed the local habitat factors affecting the
   habitat use of Prolemur simus and densities of one of its primary food
   sources Madagascar giant bamboo, Cathariostachys madagascariensis. We
   sampled vegetation and site characteristics along belt transects in
   mid-altitude rain forest areas of the Ankeniheny-Zahamena rain forest
   corridor in eastern Madagascar, with (N = 10) and without (N = 16)
   evidence of habitat use by Prolemur simus. In our study site the
   preferred habitat type of Prolemur simus appears to be primary forest
   stands with moderate to low levels of human disturbance, greater natural
   disturbance, high densities of large diameter bamboo, and high
   structural diversity in tree heights. Cathariostachys madagascariensis
   appears to exploit canopy gaps created by natural disturbances, and
   similarly often exploits areas of anthropogenic disturbance. We found
   the highest densities of bamboo to occur in areas of moderate
   anthropogenic disturbance, whereas larger diameter culms were associated
   with lower levels of disturbance and smaller culms with areas of high
   anthropogenic disturbance. Human use of the forest and protection of the
   habitat of Prolemur simus are not necessarily incompatible, but our data
   indicate that the severity and frequency of use should probably be
   relatively low. Our results suggest that in our study site management
   strategies that minimize human disturbances, promote structural
   diversity in tree heights, and maintain relatively high densities of
   large-culmed bamboo may benefit populations of Prolemur simus.},

Title = {Nocturnal Light Environments Influence Color Vision and Signatures of
   Selection on the OPN1SW Opsin Gene in Nocturnal Lemurs},
Journal = {MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {30},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1420-1437},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although loss of short-wavelength-sensitive (SWS) cones and dichromatic
   color vision in mammals has traditionally been linked to a nocturnal
   lifestyle, recent studies have identified variation in selective
   pressure for the maintenance of the OPN1SW opsin gene (and thus,
   potentially dichromacy) among nocturnal mammalian lineages. These
   studies hypothesize that purifying selection to retain SWS cones may be
   associated with a selective advantage for nocturnal color vision under
   certain ecological conditions. In this study, we explore the effect of
   nocturnal light environment on OPN1SW opsin gene evolution in a diverse
   sample of nocturnal lemurs (106 individuals, 19 species, and 5 genera).
   Using both phylogenetic and population genetic approaches, we test
   whether species from closed canopy rainforests, which are impoverished
   in short-wavelength light, have experienced relaxed selection compared
   with species from open canopy forests. We identify clear signatures of
   differential selection on OPN1SW by habitat type. Our results suggest
   that open canopy species generally experience strong purifying selection
   to maintain SWS cones. In contrast, closed canopy species experience
   weaker purifying selection or a relaxation of selection on OPN1SW. We
   also found evidence of nonfunctional OPN1SW genes in all Phaner species
   and in Cheirogaleus medius, implying at least three independent losses
   of SWS cones in cheirogaleids. Our results suggest that the evolution of
   color vision in nocturnal lemurs has been influenced by nocturnal light
   environment.},

Title = {Sleep Deprivation Impairs Spatial Retrieval but Not Spatial Learning in
   the Non-Human Primate Grey Mouse Lemur},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 22},
Abstract = {A bulk of studies in rodents and humans suggest that sleep facilitates
   different phases of learning and memory process, while sleep deprivation
   (SD) impairs these processes. Here we tested the hypothesis that SD
   could alter spatial learning and memory processing in a non-human
   primate, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), which is an
   interesting model of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two sets of
   experiments were performed. In a first set of experiments, we
   investigated the effects of SD on spatial learning and memory retrieval
   after one day of training in a circular platform task. Eleven male mouse
   lemurs aged between 2 to 3 years were tested in three different
   conditions: without SD as a baseline reference, 8 h of SD before the
   training and 8 h of SD before the testing. The SD was confirmed by
   electroencephalographic recordings. Results showed no effect of SD on
   learning when SD was applied before the training. When the SD was
   applied before the testing, it induced an increase of the amount of
   errors and of the latency prior to reach the target. In a second set of
   experiments, we tested the effect of 8 h of SD on spatial memory
   retrieval after 3 days of training. Twenty male mouse lemurs aged
   between 2 to 3 years were tested in this set of experiments. In this
   condition, the SD did not affect memory retrieval. This is the first
   study that documents the disruptive effects of the SD on spatial memory
   retrieval in this primate which may serve as a new validated challenge
   to investigate the effects of new compounds along physiological and
   pathological aging.},

Title = {Proximate determinants of bite force capacity in the mouse lemur},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {290},
Number = {1},
Pages = {42-48},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Both mating system and diet are thought to drive inter-individual
   variation in bite force. Although previously published data suggest that
   bite force variation may be driven by variation in morphology (e.g. head
   morphology, body size, muscle size), age and physiology (e.g.
   fluctuating plasma testosterone levels) in some vertebrates, this
   remains untested in primates. Here, we explore the proximal determinants
   of bite force capacity in the grey mouse lemur Microcebus murinus. Our
   results show that in male grey mouse lemurs, bite force measurements are
   repeatable across a 1-month period. Yet, bite forces were independent of
   fluctuation plasma testosterone levels. Head dimensions and body mass
   were all positively correlated with bite force. Among these, head width
   was the best predictor of bite force as has been observed for other
   vertebrates. Unexpectedly, age was highly significantly and positively
   correlated with bite force. Whereas older animals generally bit harder,
   the oldest age group (5.5 years) showed a decline in bite force
   capacity. These results suggest that bite force in the grey mouse lemur
   is mostly determined by morphology and age, yet is independent of
   variation in testosterone. Future studies including a broader age range
   and animals of different sexes would be of interest to better understand
   the variation in bite force in this small lemur.},

Abstract = {Many lemur species are arboreal, elusive, and/or nocturnal and are
   consequently difficult to approach, observe and catch. In addition, most
   of them are endangered. For these reasons, non-invasive sampling is
   especially useful in primates including lemurs. A key issue in
   conservation and ecological studies is to identify the sex of the
   sampled individuals to investigate sex-biased dispersal, parentage,
   social organization and population sex ratio. Several molecular tests of
   sex are available in apes and monkeys, but only a handful of them work
   in the lemuriform clade. Among these tests, the coamplification of the
   SRY gene with the amelogenin X gene using strepsirhine-specific X
   primers seems particularly promising, but the reliability and validity
   of this sexing test have not been properly assessed yet. In this study,
   we (i) show that this molecular sexing test works on three additional
   lemur species (Microcebus tavaratra, Propithecus coronatus and P.
   verreauxi) from two previously untested genera and one previously
   untested family, suggesting that these markers are likely to be
   universal among lemurs and other strepsirrhines; (ii) provide the first
   evidence that this PCR-based sexing test works on degraded DNA obtained
   from noninvasive samples; (iii) validate the approach using a large
   number of known-sex individuals and a multiple-tubes approach, and show
   that mismatches between the field sex and the final molecular consensus
   sex occur in less than 10\% of all the samples and that most of these
   mismatches were likely linked to incorrect sex determinations in the
   field rather than genotyping errors. Am J Phys Anthropol 150:492-503,

Abstract = {Mouse lemurs are non-human primate models of cerebral aging and
   neurodegeneration. Much smaller than other primates, they recapitulate
   numerous features of human brain aging, including progressive cerebral
   atrophy and correlation between regional atrophy and cognitive
   impairments. Characterization of brain atrophy in mouse lemurs has been
   done by MRI measures of regional CSF volume and by MRI measures of
   regional atrophy. Here, we further characterize mouse lemur brain aging
   using ex vivo MR microscopy (31 mu m in-plane resolution). First, we
   performed a non-biased, direct volumetric quantification of dentate
   gyrus and extended Ammon's horn. We show that both dentate gyrus and
   Ammon's horn undergo an age-related reorganization leading to a growth
   of the dentate gyrus and an atrophy of the Ammon's horn, even in the
   absence of global hippocampal atrophy. Second, on these first MR
   microscopic images of the mouse lemur brain, we depicted cortical and
   hippocampal hypointense spots. We demonstrated that their incidence
   increases with aging and that they correspond either to amyloid deposits
   or to cerebral microhemorrhages.},

Abstract = {Behaviour, diet and population demography were sampled and compared
   between two forest fragment-living populations of wild ringtailed lemurs
   (Lemur catta) in south-central Madagascar. Both sites-a fragment in the
   Tsaranoro Valley near Andringitra National Park, and a more densely
   populated fragment at Anja, much closer to human habitation-are sacred
   forests (sites of human burial) surrounded by anthropogenically produced
   savannah, and are subject to traditional protective prohibitions (fady).
   Both sites attract tourists, but are operated differently, with Anja
   receiving considerably more tourists; the resources available to the L.
   catta also differ at each site, affecting their behaviour. L. catta at
   Tsaranoro spent more time feeding, and less time resting and engaging in
   social behaviour than those at Anja, where abundant fruit from
   introduced trees, as well as plentiful drinking water, are available and
   resource abundance is relatively higher. Although the fragments are of
   similar size and were expected to differ little, many significant
   behavioural and population differences were observed, suggesting the
   importance of the refinement of rapid assessment techniques for judging
   the habitat suitability and conservation value of small forest
   fragments.},

   tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) is a novel membrane-anchored kinase reported
   to be involved in several normal and pathophysiological conditions,
   including endosomal membrane recycling, prostate cancer, and
   neurodegeneration. In this study, we have investigated the topology and
   orientation of LMTK2 within cellular membranes utilizing fluorescence
   protease protection. Appending the green fluorescent protein to either
   the amino or carboxyl terminus of LMTK2, we were able to determine which
   side of intracellular membrane these regions were located. Our results
   indicate that LMTK2 is an integral membrane protein in which both the
   amino and carboxyl termini are exposed to the cytoplasm. Moreover, this
   topology places the kinase active site within the cytoplasm.},

   Temperature in Young and Aged Grey Mouse Lemurs},
Journal = {OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2013},
Abstract = {In several species, resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound, activates
   sirtuin proteins implicated in the regulation of energy balance and
   biological clock processes. To demonstrate the effect of resveratrol on
   clock function in an aged primate, young and aged mouse lemurs
   (Microcebus murinus) were studied over a 4-week dietary supplementation
   with resveratrol. Spontaneous locomotor activity and daily variations in
   body temperature were continuously recorded. Reduction in locomotor
   activity onset and changes in body temperature rhythm in
   resveratrol-supplemented aged animals suggest an improved
   synchronisation on the light-dark cycle. Resveratrol could be a good
   candidate to restore the circadian rhythms in the elderly.},

Abstract = {This study is the first to assess the impact of habitat degradation and
   fragmentation on sleeping site choice and activity budgets of the
   Sahamalaza sportive lemur (Lepilemur sahamalazensis), first described in
   February 2006 and exclusively confirmed for the remaining forest
   fragments on the Sahamalaza Peninsula. Seventeen individual Lepilemurs
   in forests of different degradation levels that used two classes of
   sleeping sites (tree holes vs. tree tangles) were observed for 606 h
   during the day and 324 h at night. 24-h activity budgets were
   quantified. Preliminary analyses show differences in the ratio of active
   to inactive behaviour: (a) between different types of sleeping sites,
   and (b) between differently degraded forest fragments. Individuals
   resting in tree tangles were active during 7.4 \% of daylight hours,
   while those resting in tree holes were active for 25.4 \% of the time.
   During the day, Lepilemurs never left their chosen resting site.
   Individuals in a young secondary forest fragment were active for 14.3
   min/h during daylight hours, in mixed and mature secondary forest
   fragments 12.6 and 9.1 min/h, respectively, and in a degraded primary
   forest fragment 2.7 min/h. However, the latter group had a higher
   percentage of time out of sight. These differences are most likely
   predator avoidance strategies and highlight the importance of intact
   mature forests for this species. Further research into the diurnal
   habits of this nocturnal primate, investigating their anti-predator
   responses, and detailed habitat requirements is ongoing.},

Abstract = {The source-filter theory describes vocal production as a two-stage
   process involving the generation of a sound source, with its own
   spectral structure, which is then filtered by the resonant properties of
   the vocal tract. This theory has been successfully applied to the study
   of animal vocal signals since the 1990s. As an extension, models
   reproducing vocal tract resonance can be used to reproduce formant
   patterns and to understand the role of vocal tract filtering in nonhuman
   vocalizations. We studied three congeneric lemur species -Eulemur
   fulvus, E. macaco, E. rubriventer- using morphological measurements to
   build computational models of the vocal tract to estimate formants, and
   acoustic analysis to measure formants from natural calls. We focused on
   call types emitted through the nose, without apparent articulation. On
   the basis of anatomical measurements, we modeled the vocal tract of each
   species as a series of concatenated tubes, with a cross-sectional area
   that changed along the tract to approximate the morphology of the
   larynx, the nasopharyngeal cavity, the nasal chambers, and the nostrils.
   For each species, we calculated the resonance frequencies in 2500
   randomly generated vocal tracts, in which we simulated intraspecific
   length and size variation. Formant location and spacing showed
   significant species-specific differences determined by the length of the
   vocal tract. We then measured formants of a set of nasal vocalizations
   ({''}grunts{''}) recorded from captive lemurs of the same species. We
   found species-specific differences in the natural calls. This is the
   first evidence that morphology of the vocal tract is relevant in
   generating filter-related acoustic cues that potentially provide
   receivers with information about the species of the emitter.},

Abstract = {Chemosensory genes are frequently the target of positive selection and
   are often present in large gene families, but little is known about
   heterogeneity of selection in these cases and its relation to function.
   Here, we use the vomeronasal-1 receptor (V1R) repertoire of mouse lemurs
   (Microcebus spp.) as a model system to study patterns of selection of
   chemosensory genes at several different levels. Mouse lemurs are small
   nocturnal strepsirrhine primates and have a large (similar to 200 loci)
   repertoire of V1R loci that are likely important for intraspecific
   pheromonal communication and interspecific interactions, for example,
   recognition of predator cues. We investigated signals and patterns of
   positive selection among the 105 identified full length V1R loci in the
   gray mouse lemur and within 7 V1R loci amplified across multiple mouse
   lemur species. Phylogenetic reconstructions of published sequences
   revealed at least nine monophyletic clusters of V1Rs in gray mouse
   lemurs that have diversified since the split between lemurs and lorisoid
   primates. A large majority of clusters evolved under significant
   positive selection. Similar results were found in V1Rs of closely
   related greater galagos. Comparison with function of related V1R
   clusters in mice suggested a potential relationship between receptor
   function and strength of selection. Interestingly, most codons
   identified as being under positive selection are located in the
   extracellular domains of the receptors and hence likely indicate the
   position of residues involved in ligand binding. Positive selection was
   also detected within five V1R loci (=71\% of analyzed loci) sequenced
   from 6 to 10 mouse lemur species, indicating ongoing selection within
   the genus, which may be related to sexual selection and, potentially,
   speciation processes. Variation in strength of positive selection on
   V1Rs showed no simple relationship to cluster size. The diversity of V1R
   loci in mouse lemurs reflects their adaptive evolution and is most
   likely related to the fundamental relevance of olfactory communication

   is the predominant mode of evolution of V1R loci at all levels, and the
   substantial heterogeneity in the strength of selection may be related to

Title = {Effect of dietary fish oil supplementation on the exploratory activity,

Abstract = {The data are inconsistent about the ability of dietary omega-3 fatty
   acids to prevent age-associated cognitive decline. Indeed, most clinical
   trials have failed to demonstrate a protective effect of omega-3 fatty
   acids against cognitive decline, and methodological issues are still
   under debate. In contrast to human studies, experiments performed in
   adult rodents clearly indicate that omega-3 fatty acids supplement can
   improve behavioural and cognitive functions. The inconsistent
   observations between human and rodent studies highlight the importance
   of the use of non-human primate models. The aim of the present study was
   to address the impact of omega-3 fatty acids (given in the form of
   dietary fish oil) on exploratory activity, emotional status and spatial
   reference memory in the aged mouse lemur, a non-human primate.
   Aged animals fed fish oil exhibited decreased exploratory activity, as
   manifested by an increase in the latency to move and a reduced distance
   travelled in an open-field. The fish oil-supplemented animals exhibited
   no change in the anxiety level, but they were more reactive to go into
   the dark arms of a light/dark plus-maze. In addition, we found that fish
   oil supplementation did not significantly improve the spatial memory
   performance in the Barnes maze task.
   This study demonstrated for the first time that a fish oil diet
   initiated late in life specifically modifies the exploratory behaviour
   without improving the spatial memory of aged non-human primates. Omega-3
   fatty acid supplementation may be effective when started early in life
   but less effective when started at later ages. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Behavioral flexibility that requires behavioral inhibition has important
   fitness consequences. One task commonly used to assess behavioral
   inhibition is the reverse-reward task in which the subject is rewarded
   by the non selected items. Lemurs were tested for their ability to solve
   the qualitative version of the reverse-reward task with the choice
   between identical quantities of different food items instead of
   different quantities of the same food. Two of four subjects mastered the
   task without a correction procedure and were able to generalize the
   acquired rule to novel combinations of food. One of the two subjects
   competent on the quality version of the task could transfer this ability
   to different quantities of the same food. Our results are compared to
   lemurs' performances when tested under the quantitative version in a
   previous study and those of capuchin monkeys tested under a similar
   paradigm. The whole results suggest that the qualitative version of the
   reverse-reward task may be easier to master than its quantitative
   counterpart and that lemurs perform better than capuchin monkeys as they
   were able to later transfer the learning rule to the quantitative
   version of the task.},

Abstract = {Madagascar has a high diversity of endemic palm species and the Masoala
   Peninsula is a hotspot for their diversity. Several species are
   critically endangered and their populations known to be in decline due
   to a combination of land clearance, destructive harvesting for heart of
   palm and potentially unsustainable commercial seed collection. The
   critically endangered Voanioala gerardii and the endangered
   Lemurophoenix halleuxii are two palm species from monospecific genera
   endemic to Madagascar that overlap in their distribution within this
   region. This project undertook field surveys of all known populations of
   these two species to document their population sizes and locations. We
   modelled their area of potentially suitable habitat within the region
   and undertook genetic analysis to investigate genetic diversity and
   relatedness among populations of each species. The study found
   overlapping but contrasting patterns of potential habitat. It also found
   contrasting levels and patterns of genetic diversity between the two
   species that were not consistent with the modelled habitat
   distributions. We found that Voanioala gerardii populations are
   critically small but contain unexpectedly high levels of genetic
   diversity, which may indicate as yet undiscovered populations remaining.
   An active program to change methods of seed collection and to involve
   local villagers and land managers in the conservation of these species
   would be required to prevent their extinction.},

Abstract = {The solar outer atmosphere is an extremely dynamic environment
   characterized by the continuous interplay between the plasma and the
   magnetic field that generates and permeates it. Such interactions play a
   fundamental role in hugely diverse astrophysical systems, but occur at
   scales that cannot be studied outside the solar system. Understanding
   this complex system requires concerted, simultaneous solar observations
   from the visible to the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and soft X-rays, at
   high spatial resolution (between 0.1'' and 0.3''), at high temporal
   resolution (on the order of 10 s, i.e., the time scale of chromospheric
   dynamics), with a wide temperature coverage (0.01 MK to 20 MK, from the
   chromosphere to the flaring corona), and the capability of measuring
   magnetic fields through spectropolarimetry at visible and near-infrared
   wavelengths. Simultaneous spectroscopic measurements sampling the entire
   temperature range are particularly important. These requirements are
   fulfilled by the Japanese Solar-C mission (Plan B), composed of a
   spacecraft in a geosynchronous orbit with a payload providing a
   significant improvement of imaging and spectropolarimetric capabilities
   in the UV, visible, and near-infrared with respect to what is available
   today and foreseen in the near future. The Large European Module for
   solar Ultraviolet Research (LEMUR), described in this paper, is a large
   VUV telescope feeding a scientific payload of high-resolution imaging
   spectrographs and cameras. LEMUR consists of two major components: a VUV
   solar telescope with a 30 cm diameter mirror and a focal length of 3.6
   m, and a focal-plane package composed of VUV spectrometers covering six
   carefully chosen wavelength ranges between 170 and 1270 . The LEMUR slit
   covers 280'' on the Sun with 0.14'' per pixel sampling. In addition,
   LEMUR is capable of measuring mass flows velocities (line shifts) down
   to 2 km s (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) or better. LEMUR has been
   proposed to ESA as the European contribution to the Solar C mission.},

Abstract = {Cannibalism, defined as the eating of conspecific flesh, has been
   observed in a number of primate species, although it is still a
   relatively rare phenomenon. In cases where primates were seen feeding on
   an individual of the same species, the victims have exclusively been
   infants or juveniles. Here, I report an event of a free-living, adult
   male gray mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus, cannibalizing an adult
   conspecific female that died of an unknown cause. This observation has
   implications for the basic ecology of the species and highlights the
   potential for great flexibility in diet and behavior by a primate. This
   is, to my knowledge, the first communication of cannibalistic behavior
   in this species, as well as the first reported case of a nonhuman
   primate cannibalizing an adult conspecific. Am. J. Primatol. 74:783-787,

Abstract = {Vocalizations of Madagascar's lemurs have generally been less
   investigated than those of other primate groups, with virtually no
   information available about calling in the silky sifaka (Propithecus
   candidus), a large rainforest species. Current work examined the
   ``zzuss{''} vocalization, one of the most common and loudest sounds
   produced by this monomorphic species, and included 160 calls from nine
   adults (five males, four females) in three groups. Analyses focused on
   overall acoustic features, individual and sex differences, call usage,
   and likely function. Acoustically, the calls included separable
   turbulent noise and tonal components, with the later often marked by
   frequency jumps and dramatic frequency modulation. Male and female zzuss
   calls differed most in F0- and amplitude-related features,
   characteristics that are relatively unconstrained by overall body size.
   All measures differed among individual callers, with F0-related
   variables again playing the largest role. Based on usage, these calls
   most likely function both as generalized alarm and group-coordination
   signals. The sounds were thus of interest in several regards, including
   showing sexual differentiation in the absence of other dimorphisms,
   exhibiting primarily F0-based differentiation in both sex-and
   individual-based comparisons, and combining apparent alarm and
   coordination functions across a variety of contexts. (C) 2012 Acoustical

Abstract = {Despite the importance of dispersal for individuals and populations,
   little is known about the actual dispersal process in most species. We
   observed 90 subadult gray mouse lemurs-small, arboreal, nocturnal
   primates-in Kirindy Forest in western Madagascar, to determine the
   behavioral processes underlying natal dispersal. Twelve radio-collared
   males dispersed over distances between 180 and 960 m (a parts per
   thousand 1-7 home range diameters) away from their presumed natal
   ranges. Dispersal forays were fast and highly directed, and thus
   distinct from routine movements. Contrary to expectations of current
   hypotheses on potential differences between different types of dispersal
   movements, their special movement style did not prevent dispersers from
   interrupting forays to exploit resources they encountered during their
   forays. Data from a translocation experiment indicated that highly
   directed dispersal or search forays reflect a general strategy for
   large-scale exploration away from familiar sites in this species. A
   prolonged transfer phase was also observed, with regular commuting
   between old and new sites for up to 14 days, which probably served to
   moderate costs of unfamiliarity with a new site. In conclusion, the
   dispersal process of gray mouse lemurs is characterized by high intra-
   and interindividual consistency in movement strategies, but variation in
   the duration of the transfer phase. The observed dispersal movement
   style represents an effective strategy balancing costs of dispersal with
   the need to gather an appropriate level of information about potential
   dispersal target sites.},

Abstract = {Recent research has claimed that traditions are not a unique feature of
   human culture, but that they can be found in animal societies as well.
   However, the origins of traditions in animals studied in the wild are
   still poorly understood. To contribute comparative data to begin filling
   this gap, we conducted a social diffusion experiment with four groups of
   wild redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons). We used a `two-option'
   feeding box, where these Malagasy primates could either pull or push a
   door to get access to a fruit reward to study whether and how these two
   behavioural traits spread through the groups. During a pre-training
   phase, two groups were presented with boxes in which one technique was
   blocked, whereas two groups were presented with unblocked boxes. During
   a subsequent unconstrained phase, all four groups were confronted with
   unblocked boxes. Nearly half of the study animals were able to learn the
   new feeding skill and individuals who observed others needed fewer
   unsuccessful task manipulations until their first successful action.
   Animals in the two groups with pre-training also discovered the
   corresponding alternative technique but preferred the seeded technique.
   Interestingly, animals in the two groups without pre-training discovered
   both techniques, and one group developed a group preference for one
   technique whereas the other did not. In all groups, some animals also
   scrounged food rewards. In conclusion, redfronted lemurs appear to use
   social information in acquiring a novel task, and animals in at least in
   one group without training developed a group preference for one
   technique, indicating that they have the potential to develop
   behavioural traditions and conformity.},

Abstract = {A recent genome-wide association study identified the gene encoding
   lemur tyrosine kinase-2 (LMTK2) as a susceptibility gene for prostate
   cancer. The identified genetic alteration is within intron 9, but the
   mechanisms by which LMTK2 may impact upon prostate cancer are not clear
   because the functions of LMTK2 are poorly understood. Here, we show that
   LMTK2 regulates a known pathway that controls phosphorylation of
   kinesin-1 light chain-2 (KLC2) by glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta
   (GSK3b). KLC2 phosphorylation by GSK3 beta induces the release of cargo
   from KLC2. LMTK2 signals via protein phosphatase-1C (PP1C) to increase
   inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 beta on serine-9 that reduces KLC2
   phosphorylation and promotes binding of the known KLC2 cargo Smad2.
   Smad2 signals to the nucleus in response to transforming growth
   factor-beta (TGF beta) receptor stimulation and transport of Smad2 by
   kinesin-1 is required for this signalling. We show that small
   interfering RNA loss of LMTK2 not only reduces binding of Smad2 to KLC2,
   but also inhibits TGF beta-induced Smad2 signalling. Thus, LMTK2 may
   regulate the activity of kinesin-1 motor function and Smad2 signalling.

Abstract = {The factors that limit the distribution of the highly diverse lemur
   fauna of Madagascar are still debated. We visited an understudied region
   of eastern Madagascar, a lowland rainforest site (Sahafina, 29-230 m
   a.s.l.) close to the Mantadia National Park, in order to conduct a
   survey and collect further distributional data on mouse lemurs. We
   captured, measured, photographed, and sampled mouse lemurs from the
   Sahafina forest, performed standard phylogenetic methods based on three
   mitochondrial DNA genes, and conducted morphometric comparisons in order
   to clarify their phylogenetic position and taxonomic status. The mouse
   lemurs from the Sahafina forest could not be assigned to any of the
   known mouse lemur species and were highly divergent in all molecular
   analyses from all previously described species. Since they also differed
   morphometrically from their sister species and from their geographic
   neighbors, we propose species status and include a species description
   at the end. This study suggests that M. lehilahytsara may be the first
   highland specialist among all mouse lemurs. The distribution of the
   newly described mouse lemur is not fully known, but seems to be rather
   restricted and highly fragmented, which raises serious conservation
   concerns.},

   population management research. They have not, however, been widely used
   to answer questions about animal behavior and welfare. Here we try to
   assess the usefulness to behavioral research of two sorts of zoo records
   (ARKS, the Animal Records Keeping System, and student dissertations held
   on file) to test the hypothesis that ring-tailed lemurs with a left limb
   preference experience more negative social lives. We found that, as
   predicted, lemurs with a left limb preference (LH) received more
   aggression and were involved in less grooming than nonleft-preferent
   lemurs (NLH), though the differences were not statistically significant.
   Contrary to prediction, LH lemurs had fewer reported woundings than NLH
   lemurs, but again the difference was not statistically significant. We
   found that the ARKS reports did not contain sufficient quantified and
   systematic behavioral data for our purposes, although otherwise they
   provided an excellent context for interpreting results. The student
   dissertations were also of limited use, primarily because of the small
   time frame in which they were carried out. Because of these shortcomings
   we were unable to distinguish whether our inability to find significant
   effects was due to biological (perhaps hand preference had no
   consequences for the lemurs) or data reasons. We suggest that closer
   liaison between zoo research staff, zoo record keepers and academic
   supervisors could help to improve the usefulness of zoo records for
   behavioral research. Zoo Biol 31: 189-196, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {Studies of recently isolated populations are useful because observed
   differences can often be attributed to current environmental variation.
   Two populations of the lizard Anolis lemurinus have been isolated on the
   islands of Cayo Menor and Cayo Mayor in the Cayos Cochinos Archipelago
   of Honduras for less than 15 000 y. We measured 12 morphometric and 10
   habitat-use variables on 220 lizards across these islands in 2 y, 2008
   and 2009. The goals of our study were (1) to explore patterns of sexual
   dimorphism, and (2) to test the hypothesis that differences in
   environment among islands may have driven divergence in morphology and
   habitat use despite genetic homogeneity among populations. Although we
   found no differences among sexes in habitat use, males had narrower
   pelvic girdles and longer toe pads on both islands. Between islands,
   males differed in morphology, but neither males nor females differed in
   habitat use. Our data suggest that either recent selection has operated
   differentially on males despite low genetic differentiation, or that
   they display phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental
   variation. We suggest that patterns may be driven by variation in
   intrapopulation density or differences in predator diversity among
   islands.},

Abstract = {Folivory has evolved in all primate radiations but the relative
   importance of resource quantity and nutritional quality of food is
   controversial. To understand how food abundance and different nutrients
   affect a folivorous diet, we investigated food composition of the
   leaf-eating lemur Avahi meridionalis. From June to December 2004, we
   conducted 26 nights of focal observation (256.1 h) in Sainte Luce
   pluvial littoral forest (southeast Madagascar) and recorded feeding
   behavior of 4 radiocollared individuals. Within the subjects' home
   ranges, we recorded vegetation characteristics (morphospecies,
   phenology, diameter at breast height) and sampled food and nonfood items
   for chemical analyses. A. meridionalis did not eat fruit but only leaves
   and flowers and did not base their choice on food abundance. Adult
   leaves eaten were higher in easily soluble protein than adult leaves
   that were not consumed. The subjects ate young leaves and flowers as
   soon as they became available. These young leaves contained the same
   concentrations of soluble protein, higher concentrations of crude
   protein, and lower concentrations of acid detergent fiber and sugar than
   mature food leaves. A. meridionalis ate leaves with condensed tannins,
   alkaloids, and intermediate concentrations of polyphenolics. Contrary to
   previous studies that considered Avahi spp. a specialist, A.
   meridionalis acted as leaf-eating generalists with moderate selectivity,
   based on nutritional quality and tolerance of a wide array of plant
   secondary metabolites. This illustrates the dietary flexibility within a
   single genus of primates that seems to be driven by environmental
   constraints rather than morphological or physiological adaptations.},

Abstract = {Different species vary in their ability to wait for delayed rewards in
   intertemporal choice tasks. Models of rate maximization account for part
   of this variation, but other factors such as social structure and
   feeding ecology seem to underly some species differences. Though studies
   have evaluated intertemporal choice in several primate species,
   including Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, and apes, prosimians
   have not been tested. This study investigated intertemporal choices in
   three species of lemur (black-and-white ruffed lemurs, Varecia
   variegata, red ruffed lemurs, Varecia rubra, and black lemurs, Eulemur
   macaco) to assess how they compare to other primate species and whether
   their choices are consistent with rate maximization. We offered lemurs a
   choice between two food items available immediately and six food items
   available after a delay. We found that by adjusting the delay to the
   larger reward, the lemurs were indifferent between the two options at a
   mean delay of 17 s, ranging from 9 to 25 s. These data are comparable to
   data collected from common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). The lemur
   data were not consistent with models of rate maximization. The addition
   of lemurs to the list of species tested in these tasks will help uncover
   the role of life history and socio-ecological factors influencing
   intertemporal choices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Evaluating ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) from southwestern Madagascar

Abstract = {In light of historical and recent anthropogenic influences on Malagasy
   primate populations, in this study ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta)
   samples from two sites in southwestern Madagascar, Beza Mahafaly Special
   Reserve (BMSR) and Tsimanampetsotsa National Park (TNP), were evaluated
   for the genetic signature of a population bottleneck. A total of 45
   individuals (20 from BMSR and 25 from TNP) were genotyped at seven
   microsatellite loci. Three methods were used to evaluate these
   populations for evidence of a historical bottleneck: M-ratio,
   mode-shift, and heterozygosity excess tests. Three mutation models were
   used for heterozygosity excess tests: the stepwise mutation model (SMM),
   two-phase model (TPM), and infinite allele model (IAM). M-ratio
   estimations indicated a potential bottleneck in both populations under
   some conditions. Although mode-shift tests did not strongly indicate a
   population bottleneck in the recent historical past when samples from
   all individuals were included, a female-only analysis indicated a
   potential bottleneck in TNP. Heterozygosity excess was indicated under
   two of the three mutation models (IAM and TPM), with TNP showing
   stronger evidence of heterozygosity excess than BMSR. Taken together,
   these results suggest that a bottleneck may have occurred among L. catta
   in southwestern Madagascar in the recent past. Given knowledge of how
   current major stochastic climatic events and human-induced change can
   negatively impact extant lemur populations, it is reasonable that
   comparable events in the historical past could have caused a population
   bottleneck. This evaluation additionally functions to highlight the
   continuing environmental and anthropogenic challenges faced by lemurs in
   southwestern Madagascar. Am J Phys Anthropol 147: 21-29, 2012. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Madagascar provides some of the rare examples where two or more primate
   species of the same genus and with seemingly identical niche
   requirements occur in sympatry. If congeneric primate species co-occur
   in other parts of the world, they differ in size in a way that is
   consistent with Hutchinson's rule for coexisting species, or they occupy
   different ecological niches. In some areas of Madagascar, mouse lemurs
   do not follow these ``rules{''} and thus seem to violate one of the
   principles of community ecology. In order to understand the mechanisms
   that allow coexistence of sympatric congeneric species without obvious
   niche differentiation, we studied food composition of two identical
   sized omnivorous mouse lemur species, Microcebus griseorufus and M.
   murinus with the help of stable isotope analyses (delta N-15 and delta
   C-13). The two species are closely related sister species. During the
   rich season, when food seems abundant, the two species do not differ in
   their nitrogen isotope composition, indicating that the two species
   occupy the same trophic level. But they differ in their delta C-13
   values, indicating that M. griseorufus feeds more on C-4 and CAM
   (Crassulacean-acid-metabolism) plants than M. murinus. During the lean
   season, M. murinus has lower delta N-15 values, indicating that the two
   species feed at different trophic levels during times of food shortage.
   Hybrids between the two species showed intermediate food composition.
   The results reflect subtle differences in foraging or metabolic
   adaptations that are difficult to quantify by traditional observations
   but that represent possibilities to allow coexistence of species.},

Title = {Hybridization of mouse lemurs: different patterns under different
   ecological conditions},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Background: Several mechanistic models aim to explain the
   diversification of the multitude of endemic species on Madagascar. The
   island's biogeographic history probably offered numerous opportunities
   for secondary contact and subsequent hybridization. Existing
   diversification models do not consider a possible role of these
   processes. One key question for a better understanding of their
   potential importance is how they are influenced by different
   environmental settings. Here, we characterized a contact zone between
   two species of mouse lemurs, Microcebus griseorufus and M. murinus, in
   dry spiny bush and mesic gallery forest that border each other sharply
   without intermediate habitats between them. We performed population
   genetic analyses based on mtDNA sequences and nine nuclear
   microsatellites and compared the results to a known hybrid zone of the
   same species in a nearby wide gradient from dry spiny bush over
   transitional forest to humid littoral forest.
   Results: In the spiny-gallery system, Microcebus griseorufus is
   restricted to the spiny bush; Microcebus murinus occurs in gallery
   forest and locally invades the dryer habitat of its congener. We found
   evidence for bidirectional introgressive hybridization, which is closely
   linked to increased spatial overlap within the spiny bush. Within 159
   individuals, we observed 18 hybrids with mitochondrial haplotypes of
   both species. Analyses of simulated microsatellite data indicate that we
   identified hybrids with great accuracy and that we probably
   underestimated their true number. We discuss short-term climatic
   fluctuations as potential trigger for the dynamic of invasion and
   subsequent hybridization. In the gradient hybrid zone in turn, long-term
   aridification could have favored unidirectional nuclear introgression
   from Microcebus griseorufus into M. murinus in transitional forest.
   Conclusions: Madagascar's southeastern transitional zone harbors two
   very different hybrid zones of mouse lemurs in different environmental
   settings. This sheds light on the multitude of opportunities for the
   formation of hybrid zones and indicates an important influence of
   environmental factors on secondary contact and hybridization. Our
   findings suggest that hybridization could enhance the adaptability of
   mouse lemurs without necessarily leading to a loss of distinctiveness.
   They point to a potential role of hybridization in Madagascar's
   diversification history that requires further investigation.},

Abstract = {Although primates have remarkable olfactory capabilities, their ability
   for olfactory predator recognition is still understudied. We
   investigated this cognitive ability in wild gray and golden-brown mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus murinus and M. ravelobensis) that were confronted
   with four different olfactory stimuli, derived from two Malagasy
   predators (fossa and barn owl) and two local nonpredator species (brown
   lemur and sifaka). The predator response was tested (1) in a systematic
   cage setup and (2) in a two-way choice experiment with two Sherman traps
   on platforms in the forest (stimulus trap vs. nonstimulus trap). For
   part 1, the study animals were housed in cages during habituation and 5
   days of experiments. One stimulus was tested per night and was presented
   underneath a drinking bottle. The changes in the time spent close to the
   stimulus and the drinking time at the bottle were used as indicators of
   predator recognition. A timidity score was established by classifying
   the strength of the antipredator response during the experiment. The
   study animals spent significantly less time drinking and less time in
   the stimulus area when confronted with fossa odor compared with the
   other stimuli. The timidity score was significantly higher during the
   fossa stimulus compared with the nonpredator and the control stimuli.
   The two-way choice experiments revealed a complete avoidance of the
   fossa odor, which was not found with the other stimuli. Thus, wild mouse
   lemurs showed clear signs of olfactory predator recognition in the case
   of the fossa in both experiments, but no signs of avoidance to the other
   presented stimuli. The lack of owl avoidance may be explained by less or
   no aversive metabolites in the owl stimulus or by lower significance for
   olfactory recognition of aerial predators. Furthermore, the results
   showed slight differences between the two mouse lemur species that may
   be linked to differences in their ecology. Am. J. Primatol. 73:928-938,

Volume = {46},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Epidemiological evidence related to increased death from hyperthermia
   suggests higher frailty in the elderly when exposed to high ambient
   temperatures. Despite the recent awareness of such public health
   problems, integrative studies investigating the effects of age on the
   physiological responses to heat wave thermal conditions remain scarce.
   Daily rhythmicity of core temperature (T(c)) and locomotor activity
   (LA), as well as parameters representative of energy balance and IGF-1
   levels which are involved in the aging process and stress resistance,
   were monitored in a non-human primate species, the gray mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus). Adult and aged animals, acclimated to long days
   (LD) or short days (SD), were monitored during 8-day periods of exposure
   to 25 degrees C and 34 degrees C.
   Adult animals displayed efficient coping with heat exposure, regardless
   of the photoperiod. Hence, efficient responses resulted in decrease of
   energy intake, energy expenditure. IGF-1 levels and LA levels, promoting
   hyperthermia avoidance. Positive energy balance was maintained and water
   turnover did not change significantly after heat exposure.
   In contrast, while aged animals acclimated to LD responded similarly to
   adults, aged mouse lemurs acclimated to SD showed great difficulties
   coping with heat exposure. Indeed, in this group, normothermia
   impairment was associated with increased T(c) levels, alterations in
   daily rhythmicity, negative energy balance and increased IGF-1 levels.
   Impaired responses to heat exposure were seen in aged mouse lemurs
   acclimated to SD only. The main effects were observed during diurnal
   resting periods, suggesting decreased capacities with age to dissipate
   excess body heat. Taken together, these data highlight daily rhythmicity
   and IGF-1 pathway as main targets in the impaired response to heat
   exposure in the elderly. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Climate change will impose new constraints on the distribution of
   species through desertification. Small-scale endemists common in
   biodiversity hotspots such as Madagascar are especially threatened.
   Among them are the gray-brown mouse lemurs (Microcebus griseorufus),
   which occupy the driest habitats in Madagascar of all Microcebus spp. We
   studied impacts of aridity on this species to identify critical factors
   for distributional limits. Accordingly, we compared populations of 2
   adjacent habitats that differ in their humidity levels. We found that
   the more humid habitat provided more high-quality food and maintained a
   higher population density of Microcebus griseorufus, with individuals in
   better condition compared to the drier habitat. At the end of the wet,
   but not in the dry season, Microcebus griseorufus adjusted its home
   range size to local food plant density, which indicates that individuals
   optimize food intake in the wet season to prepare for the dry season. We
   found a negative exponential relationship between food plant density and
   home range size, which suggests an upper limit for the size of home
   ranges. According to this relationship, individuals from the drier
   habitat could not compensate for reduced food availability by enlarging
   their home range beyond this threshold. Thus, in case of declining food
   availability during the wet season due to a generally drier climate,
   individuals will not be able to extend their home ranges to include more
   food resources, and hence to accumulate enough fat reserves for the dry
   season. In consequence, they will have to migrate toward more mesic
   refugia. Migration, however, requires habitat connectivity, which is
   scarce in Madagascar's largely anthropogenic and heavily fragmented
   landscape. Our data suggest that upper limits in home range sizes can
   limit a species' ability to adapt to increasing aridity.},

Abstract = {The small-bodied nocturnal mouse lemurs (genus Microcebus) occupy a
   variety of habitats in Madagascar. Gray (M. murinus) and brown (M.
   rufus) mouse lemurs have been widely studied both in the wild and
   captivity. Whereas captive studies revealed an endogenous regulation of
   reproduction entrained by photoperiod, field studies have suggested that
   reproductive activation could be affected by additional climatic,
   physical, or social conditions. I collected data on wild brown mouse
   lemur females at Ranomafana between 2004 and 2008 to determine: 1) the
   timing of estrus and estrous periodicities across multiple seasons, and
   2) whether additional factors such as body mass, age, or rainfall are
   correlated with onset of reproduction. In mouse lemur females at
   Ranomafana, the first seasonal estrus occurs 3-4 weeks after the vernal
   equinox. I report similar to 1 month's intra-population variation in the
   timing of estrus and inter-annual estrous intervals with periodicities
   of similar to 365 days. There were significant differences between the
   onset of reproduction across years. Estrous onset was uncorrelated with
   body mass, but there was an apparent age effect. There was a significant
   negative correlation between August rainfall and onset of reproduction
   when 2004 data were removed from the analysis. Results from this study
   are consistent with the notion that timing of estrus is
   photoperiod-dependent. As in captivity, intra-population variation in
   estrous onset is similar to 4 weeks in length. In the wild, variation in
   estrous onset and polyestry (multiple reproductive opportunities per
   year) appear to be favored under the highly unpredictable conditions of
   Madagascar's environments. Am J Phys Anthropol 145:311-317, 2011. (C)

Abstract = {Many animal species live as a group and must therefore move as such.
   Several authors have suggested that the mechanisms underlying collective
   movements in primate species appear to rely on complex cognitive skills,
   given their high level of cognitive abilities. However, recent studies
   have highlighted the fact that complex patterns do not necessarily imply
   complex mechanisms. We used a modeling approach to investigate the
   patterns of collective movement in a semi-free-ranging group of brown
   lemurs. We recorded via digital video cameras the order and joining
   latencies of the 11 individuals of the group during the departure time
   of spontaneous group movements. We then assessed whether mimetic
   mechanisms or the existence of a leader were underlying conditions for
   the joining process by testing 5 computer models relying respectively on
   5 hypotheses: the independence of individuals, an anonymous mimetism, a
   mimetism according to kinship, a mimetism according to affiliation, and
   eventually the existence of a leader. We found that departure latencies,
   associations, and the order of individuals at departure time could all
   be explained by the mimetism according to affiliation model. Thus, an
   individual's decision to join the collective movement or not depended on
   the decision taken by its preferred social partners. These results show
   the importance of social parameters in primate decision making and that
   the high cohesion displayed by the group members might not be
   constrained merely by ecological factors such as predation or foraging
   consideration.},

Abstract = {Because closely related species are likely to be ecologically similar
   owing to common ancestry, they should show some degree of
   differentiation in order to coexist. We studied 2 morphologically
   similar congeneric species, the golden-brown mouse lemur (Microcebus
   ravelobensis) and the gray mouse lemur (M. murinus). These species are
   found in partial sympatry in the dry deciduous forest in northwestern
   Madagascar. We investigated whether 1) feeding niche differentiation
   and/or 2) a reduction in locomotor activity during periods of food
   shortage, which might reflect an energy saving strategy, can explain the
   coexistence of these 2 lemur species. To obtain feeding and behavioral
   data, we conducted focal observations of 11 female Microcebus murinus
   and 9 female M. ravelobensis during 11 months from 2007 to 2008 and
   collected fecal samples for 6 mo. We monitored the phenology of 272
   plant specimens and trapped arthropods to determine food availability.
   Results revealed interspecific differences in 1) relative proportion of
   consumed food resources, resulting in a merely partial dietary overlap,
   and in 2) relative importance of seasonally varying food resources
   throughout the year. In addition, females of Microcebus murinus showed a
   reduction in locomotor activity during the early dry season, which might
   reflect an energy-saving strategy and might further reduce potential
   competition with M. ravelobensis over limited food resources. To
   conclude, a combination of interspecific feeding niche differentiation
   and differences in locomotor activity appears to facilitate the
   coexistence of Microcebus murinus and M. ravelobensis.},

Abstract = {Although some conservationists accept that not all species can be saved,
   we illustrate the difficulty in deciding which species are dispensable.
   In this article, we examine the possibility that the integrity of a
   forest relies on its entire faunal assemblage. In Madagascar, one faunal
   group, the lemurs, accounts for the greatest biomass and species
   richness among frugivores. For example, 7 of the 13 sympatric lemur
   species in Madagascar's eastern rainforests consume primarily fruit.
   Because of this, we suggest that some tree species may rely heavily on
   particular lemur taxa for both seed dispersal and germination. In
   Ranomafana National Park, the diets for four of the day-active lemur
   frugivores have been documented during annual cycles over a 5-year
   period. We predicted that, although the fruit of some plant taxa would
   be exploited by multiple lemur species, the fruit of others would be
   eaten by one lemur species alone. Analyses reveal that while lemurs
   overlap in a number of fruit taxa exploited, 46\% (16/35) of families
   and 56\% (29/52) of genera are eaten exclusively by one lemur species.
   We, therefore, predict local changes in forest composition and structure
   if certain of these lemur species are eliminated from a forest owing to
   hunting, disease, or habitat disturbance. We also suggest that this
   result may be of global significance because carbon sequestration by the
   tropical forests in Madagascar may be reduced as a result of this
   predicted change in forest composition. Am. J. Primatol. 73:585-602,

Title = {Better Few than Hungry: Flexible Feeding Ecology of Collared Lemurs
   Eulemur collaris in Littoral Forest Fragments},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {Background: Frugivorous primates are known to encounter many problems to
   cope with habitat degradation, due to the fluctuating spatial and
   temporal distribution of their food resources. Since lemur communities
   evolved strategies to deal with periods of food scarcity, these primates
   are expected to be naturally adapted to fluctuating ecological
   conditions and to tolerate a certain degree of habitat changes. However,
   behavioral and ecological strategies adopted by frugivorous lemurs to
   survive in secondary habitats have been little investigated. Here, we
   compared the behavioral ecology of collared lemurs (Eulemur collaris) in
   a degraded fragment of littoral forest of south-east Madagascar,
   Mandena, with that of their conspecifics in a more intact habitat,
   Sainte Luce.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Lemur groups in Mandena and in Sainte
   Luce were censused in 2004/2007 and in 2000, respectively. Data were
   collected via instantaneous sampling on five lemur groups totaling 1,698
   observation hours. The Shannon index was used to determine dietary
   diversity and nutritional analyses were conducted to assess food
   quality. All feeding trees were identified and measured, and ranging
   areas determined via the minimum convex polygon. In the degraded area
   lemurs were able to modify several aspects of their feeding strategies
   by decreasing group size and by increasing feeding time, ranging areas,
   and number of feeding trees. The above strategies were apparently able
   to counteract a clear reduction in both food quality and size of feeding
   trees.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our findings indicate that collared lemurs in
   littoral forest fragments modified their behavior to cope with the
   pressures of fluctuating resource availability. The observed flexibility
   is likely to be an adaptation to Malagasy rainforests, which are known
   to undergo periods of fruit scarcity and low productivity. These results
   should be carefully considered when relocating lemurs or when selecting
   suitable areas for their conservation.},

Abstract = {We assessed the regional brain atrophy in mouse lemur primates from 4.7
   T T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. Thirty animals aged from 1.9 to
   11.3 years were imaged. Sixty-one percent of the 23 animals older than 3
   years involved in the study displayed an atrophy process.
   Cross-sectional analysis suggests that the atrophy follows a gradual
   pathway, starting in the frontal region then involving the temporal
   and/or the parietal part of the brain and finally the occipital region.
   Histological evaluation of five animals selected according to various
   stages of atrophy suggested that extracellular amyloid deposits and tau
   pathology cannot explain by themselves this atrophy and that
   intracellular amyloid deposition is more closely linked to this
   pathology. This study suggests that most of the age-related atrophy
   occurring in mouse lemurs is caused by one clinical, evolving,
   pathological process. The ability to follow this pathology
   non-invasively by MRI will allow to further characterize it and evaluate
   its relationship with neuropathological lesions that are involved in
   human diseases such as Alzheimer. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Different Competitive Potential in Two Coexisting Mouse Lemur Species in

Volume = {145},

Abstract = {Interspecific competition has been suggested to influence the
   biogeographic distribution patterns of species. A high competitive
   potential could entail species-specific advantages during resource
   acquisition that could translate into a higher potential for range
   expansion. We investigated whether differences in the competitive
   potential of the morphologically similar and partially sympatric gray
   mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) and golden-brown mouse lemur
   (Microcebus ravelobensis) may help to explain differences in their
   geographic range sizes. We carried out encounter experiments with 14
   pairs of captured female mouse lemurs of both species. The experimental
   dyads were tested in a two-cage arrangement, with individuals being
   separated from each other outside the experiments. Two days of
   habituation and four subsequent days of 1-h encounter experiments were
   conducted, before releasing the animals again in the wild. In general,
   the M. murinus individuals won significantly more conflicts than their
   partners. In eight of 14 tested pairs, there was a significant species
   bias in winning conflicts, and in 87.5\% of these dyads, M. murinus was
   the ``dyad winner{''}. A high competitive potential did not depend on
   body mass. Furthermore, ``dyad winners{''} spent more time feeding (P <
   0.05) and were less spatially restricted than ``dyad losers{''}. To
   conclude, our results suggest that the widely distributed M. murinus may
   indeed have a higher competitive potential than the regional endemic M.
   ravelobensis, which may, among other possible factors, have enabled this
   species to expand geographically, despite the presence of other
   competing congeners. Am J Phys Anthropol 145:156-162, 2011. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Primates deal with fluctuations of the thermal environment by both
   physiological and behavioral mechanisms of thermoregulation. In this
   article we focus on nonhibernating lemurs, which are hypometabolic and
   have to cope with a seasonal environment. Behavioral thermoregulation
   has received little attention compared with specific physiological
   adaptations to seasonality, i.e., hibernation and torpor, which
   characterize a number of lemurs. We investigated the role of seasonality
   and dietary-related factors in determining frequencies of resting,
   social and postural thermoregulation, and microhabitat selection in
   collared lemurs, Eulemur collaris. We observed two groups of collared
   lemurs over a 14-month period in the littoral forest of Sainte Luce,
   Southern Madagascar. Frequencies of total resting and time spent in
   huddling, prone, and curled postures were collected via 5-mM
   instantaneous sampling. Microhabitat selection was evaluated as the
   proportion of time spent in the upper canopy as compared with other
   layers. Climatic variables were recorded by automatic data loggers,
   while dietary variables were derived from phenological data and
   nutritional analyses of the ingested food items. We weighted the
   combined effects of climatic and dietary variables on the different
   types of behavioral thermoregulation by means of canonical correlation
   analysis. The model with the strongest canonical correlation included a
   first root representing mainly feeding time, day length, and ambient
   temperature and a second root representing diet quality and height of
   feeding trees. The output indicated that collared lemurs adapt to
   thermal and dietary-related metabolic stress by adjusting resting time,
   social, and postural thermoregulation. Am J Phys Anthropol 144:355-364,

Title = {Comparing chromosomal and mitochondrial phylogenies of the Indriidae
   (Primates, Lemuriformes)},
Journal = {CHROMOSOME RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {209-224},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Malagasy primate family Indriidae comprises three genera with up to
   19 species. Cytogenetic and molecular phylogenies of the Indriidae have
   been performed with special attention to the genus Propithecus.
   Comparative R-banding and FISH with human paints were applied to
   karyotypes of representatives of all three genera and confirmed most of
   the earlier R-banding results. However, additional chromosomal
   rearrangements were detected. A reticulated and a cladistic phylogeny,
   the latter including hemiplasies, have been performed. Cladistic
   analysis of cytogenetic data resulted in a phylogenetic tree revealing
   (1) monophyly of the family Indriidae, (2) monophyly of the genus Avahi,
   (3) sister-group relationships between Propithecus diadema and
   Propithecus edwardsi, and (4) the grouping of the latter with Indri
   indri, Propithecus verreauxi, and Propithecus tattersalli, and thus
   suggesting paraphyly of the genus Propithecus. A molecular phylogeny
   based on complete mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences of 16 species
   indicated some identical relationships, such as the monophyly of Avahi
   and the sister-group relationships of the eastern (P. diadema and P.
   edwardsi) to the western Propithecus species (P. verreauxi, Propithecus
   coquereli, and P. tattersalli). However, the main difference between the
   molecular and cytogenetic phylogenies consists in an early divergence of
   Indri in the molecular phylogeny while in the chromosomal phylogeny it
   is nested within Propithecus. The similarities and differences between
   molecular and cytogenetic phylogenies in relation to data on the
   species' geographic distributions and mating systems allow us to propose
   a scenario of the evolution of Indriidae. Chromosomal and molecular
   processes alone or in combination created a reproductive barrier that
   was then followed by further speciation processes.},

Abstract = {Flexibility in physiological processes is essential to adequately
   respond to changes in environmental conditions. Madagascar is a
   particularly challenging environment because climatic conditions seem
   less predictable than in comparative ecosystems in other parts of the
   world. We used the reddish-gray mouse lemur (Microcebus griseorufus)
   from the most unpredictable environment in Madagascar as a model to
   investigate the flexibility of energy saving strategies to cope with the
   unpredictability of their habitat. For this we measured T-sk of
   free-ranging mouse lemurs throughout the year using temperature data
   loggers. M. griseorufus showed a very strong seasonal as well as an
   individual flexibility in thermoregulation. During the rainy season all
   M. griseorufus remained normothermic. At the beginning of the dry season
   individuals started to exhibit different energy saving strategies:
   irregular short torpor bouts, regular daily torpor, prolonged torpor of
   a few days, and hibernation over several weeks. The accumulation of
   sufficient seasonal body fat was the crucial factor determining the
   thermal behavior of individuals. The observed intraspecific and sex
   independent variation in thermoregulatory patterns within one population
   inhabiting the same small geographical area is exceptional and gives M.
   griseorufus the ability to respond to current environmental as well as
   individual conditions. This thermal plasticity might be seen as a key to
   success and survival for M. griseorufus in an extremely unpredictable
   environment.},

Title = {Historical demography of a wild lemur population (Propithecus verreauxi)
   in southwest Madagascar},
Journal = {POPULATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The human colonization of Madagascar is associated with the extinction
   of numerous lemur species. However, the degree to which humans have
   negatively influenced the historical population dynamics of extant lemur
   species is not well understood. This study employs genetic and
   demographic analyses to estimate demographic parameters relating to the
   historical population dynamics of a wild lemur population, Verreaux's
   sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi). The genetic analyses are used to
   determine whether this population experienced a historically recent
   (i.e., within the last 2000 years) population bottleneck, as well as to
   estimate the historical population growth rate and the timing of any
   changes in population size in the past. In addition, a retrospective
   demographic analysis is used to determine sources of variation and
   covariation in the sifaka life cycle and how variation in life-cycle
   transitions contributes to variation in population growth rate. The
   genetic analyses indicate that the sifaka population did not experience
   a recent population bottleneck; however, the historical population
   growth rate was negative, indicating that the ancestral population size
   was much larger than the current size. The timing of the ancestral
   population decline has a point estimate of 2300 years ago, but with
   large credible intervals: 3611-1736 years ago. This point estimate
   corresponds with the first evidence for human arrival to Madagascar.
   Climatic variation has also likely influenced past (and current)
   population dynamics due to stochastic annual rainfall patterns and
   climatic desiccation, the latter of which began in southwestern
   Madagascar around 4000 years ago. Variation in the survival of
   2-year-old animals as well as large adult females makes the largest
   contribution to variation in population growth rate. In the absence of
   more explicit models pertaining to historical population dynamics, it is
   difficult to attribute the negative population growth rate of this
   species solely to a single factor (e.g., hunting, habitat destruction).},

   transfer an ascending numerical rule from the values 1-4 to novel values
   5-9. Both lemurs successfully ordered the novel values with above chance
   accuracy. Accuracy was modulated by the ratio between the two numerical
   values suggesting that lemurs accessed the approximate number system

Abstract = {To improve our knowledge of the distribution of the critically
   endangered greater bamboo lemur Prolemur simus, we surveyed 6 sites in
   eastern Madagascar. We found its characteristic feeding signs at 5 sites
   and made a direct sighting at one of these. One site represents a
   northern extension of 45 km of the known extant range of the species.
   Two sites are located in a forest corridor approximately halfway between
   the previously known southern and northern populations, therefore
   suggesting a broadly continuous distribution of the species within its
   range rather than the previously suspected distribution of two distinct
   populations separated by a distance of over 200 km. Our results
   illustrate the benefit of species-focussed surveys in determining the
   true distribution of endangered species, a realistic measure which is
   necessary in order to assess their current status and to prioritise
   long-term conservation interventions. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG,

Abstract = {Age and gender are known to significantly modulate thermoregulatory
   capacities in mammals suggesting strong impacts on behavioral
   adjustments which are used to minimize the energy costs of
   thermoregulation We tested the effects of sex and age on spontaneous
   choice of ambient temperature (Ta) in a non-human primate species the
   mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) The animals acclimated to both winter
   and summer photoperiods two seasons significantly modifying
   thermoregulation function were experimented in a thermal gradient device
   During winter adult males did not show preference for warm Tas whereas
   old males did In contrast female mouse lemurs of both age categories
   exhibited great preferences for warm Tas Acclimation to summer revealed
   that males selected colder Ta for the day than during the night Such
   behavior did not exist in females Old females explored and selected
   warmer nests than adult ones This study raised novel issues on the
   effect of gender on thermoregulatory capacities in the mouse lemur
   Females probably use behavioral adjustments to limit energy expenditure
   and might prefer to preserve energy for maternal investment by
   anticipation of and during the breeding season Further experiments
   focusing on female thermoregulatory capacities are needed to better
   understand the energy challenge that may occur during winter and summer
   in female mouse lemurs and whether this trade off changes during aging

Title = {Variation in Dental Wear and Tooth Loss Among Known-Aged, Older

Abstract = {Tooth wear is generally an age-related phenomenon, often assumed to
   occur at similar rates within populations of primates and other mammals,
   and has been suggested as a correlate of reduced offspring survival
   among wild lemurs. Few long-term wild studies have combined detailed
   study of primate behavior and ecology with dental analyses. Here, we
   present data on dental wear and tooth loss in older (> 10 years old)
   wild and captive ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). Among older
   ring-tailed lemurs at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve (BMSR),
   Madagascar (n=6), the percentage of severe dental wear and tooth loss
   ranges from 6 to 50\%. Among these six individuals, the oldest (19 years
   old) exhibits the second lowest frequency of tooth loss (14\%). The
   majority of captive lemurs at the Indianapolis Zoo (n=7) are older than
   the oldest BMSR lemur, yet display significantly less overall tooth wear
   for 19 of 36 tooth positions, with only two individuals exhibiting
   antemortem tooth loss. Among the captive lemurs, only one lemur (a
   nearly 29 year old male) has lost more than one tooth. This individual
   is only missing anterior teeth, in contrast to lemurs at BMSR, where the
   majority of lost teeth are postcanine teeth associated with processing
   specific fallback foods. Postcanine teeth also show significantly more
   overall wear at BMSR than in the captive sample. At BMSR, degree of
   severe wear and tooth loss varies in same aged, older individuals,
   likely reflecting differences in microhabitat, and thus the availability
   and use of different foods. This pattern becomes apparent before ``old
   age,{''} as seen in individuals as young as 7 years. Among the four
   ``older{''} female lemurs at BMSR, severe wear and/or tooth loss do not
   predict offspring survival. Am. J. Primatol. 72:1026-1037, 2010. (C)

Abstract = {The evolution of group-living has fascinated but also puzzled
   researchers from the inception of behavioural ecology. We use a simple
   optimality approach to examine some of the costs and benefits of
   group-living in redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus). We show that
   dominant males profit from accepting subordinates within their groups,
   as the latter significantly decrease the likelihood that the group is
   taken over by intruders. This benefit is large enough to outweigh the
   costs of reproductive competition and may constitute the driving force
   behind the evolution of multi-male associations in this species.},

Abstract = {Studies of primate life history variation are constrained by the fact
   that all large-bodied extant primates are haplorhines. However,
   large-bodied strepsirrhines recently existed. If we can extract life
   history information from their skeletons, these species can contribute
   to our understanding of primate life history variation. This is
   particularly important in light of new critiques of the classic
   ``fast-slow continuum{''} as a descriptor of variation in life history
   profiles across mammals in general. We use established dental
   histological methods to estimate gestation length and age at weaning for
   five extinct lemur species. On the basis of these estimates, we
   reconstruct minimum interbirth intervals and maximum reproductive rates.
   We utilize principal components analysis to create a multivariate ``life
   history space{''} that captures the relationships among reproductive
   parameters and brain and body size in extinct and extant lemurs. Our
   data show that, whereas large-bodied extinct lemurs can be described as
   ``slow{''} in some fashion, they also varied greatly in their life
   history profiles. Those with relatively large brains also weaned their
   offspring late and had long interbirth intervals. These were not the
   largest of extinct lemurs. Thus, we distinguish size-related life
   history variation from variation that linked more strongly to ecological
   factors. Because all lemur species larger than 10 kg, regardless of life
   history profile, succumbed to extinction after humans arrived in
   Madagascar, we argue that large body size increased the probability of
   extinction independently of reproductive rate. We also provide some
   evidence that, among lemurs, brain size predicts reproductive rate
   better than body size. Am J Phys Anthropol 142:391-404, 2010. (C) 2010

Abstract = {The cold-induced enhancement of non-shivering thermogenesis (NST),
   involving brown-adipose tissue (BAT) metabolism, could participate to
   impair energy balance in the aged gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus).
   We first investigated the age-related modulations of cold-stimulated BAT
   cell morphology and contents. Then, NST was pharmacologically stimulated
   to assess whether aging impaired NST activation in the mouse lemur.
   In reference conditions, the ability to activate NST was preserved
   during aging in the mouse lemur as BAT morphology and UCP-1 presence did
   not differ between adult and aged mouse lemurs. Also, the
   pharmacological activation of NST revealed similar increased levels of
   O(2) consumption in adult and aged animals, confirming that no age
   effect could be evidenced on NST activation at 25 degrees C. However,
   preliminary histological data revealed a lack of lipid resources in one
   aged individual during cold exposure. Surprisingly, the pharmacological
   activation of NST revealed an impaired evacuation of the excess body
   heat in aged animals, associated with increased energy expenditure.
   Thus, aging seems to be related to decreased capacities in the
   maintenance of NST rather than in its activation. Energy mobilization
   could be impaired in the aging mouse lemur but remains to be
   demonstrated. (C) Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Torpor on Demand: Heterothermy in the Non-Lemur Primate Galago moholi},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 24},
Abstract = {Background: Hibernation and daily torpor are energy-and water-saving
   adaptations employed to survive unfavourable periods mostly in temperate
   and arctic environments, but also in tropical and arid climates.
   Heterothermy has been found in a number of mammalian orders, but within
   the primates so far it seems to be restricted to one family of Malagasy
   lemurs. As currently there is no evidence of heterothermy of a primate
   outside of Madagascar, the aim of our study was to investigate whether
   small primates from mainland Africa are indeed always homeothermic
   despite pronounced seasonal changes in weather and food availability.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: One of the nearest relatives of Malagasy
   lemurs, the African lesser bushbaby, Galago moholi, which inhabits a
   highly seasonal habitat with a hot wet-season and a cold dry-season with
   lower food abundance, was investigated to determine whether it is
   capable of heterothermy. We measured skin temperature of free-ranging
   individuals throughout the cool dry season using temperature-sensitive
   collars as well as metabolic rate in captured individuals. Torpor was
   employed by 15\% of 20 animals. Only one of these animals displayed
   heterothermy in response to natural availability of food and water,
   whereas the other animals became torpid without access to food and
   water.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that G. moholi are
   physiologically capable of employing torpor. However they do not use it
   as a routine behaviour, but only under adverse conditions. This
   reluctance is presumably a result of conflicting selective pressures for
   energy savings versus other ecological and evolutionary forces, such as
   reproduction or territory defence. Our results support the view that
   heterothermy in primates evolved before the division of African and
   Malagasy Strepsirhini, with the possible implication that more primate
   species than previously thought might still have the potential to call
   upon this possibility, if the situation necessitates it.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to quantify the concentrations of crude
   protein, fat, ash, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber,

   consumed by wild black and white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata).
   Calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, potassium, sodium, iron, zinc, copper,

   A total of 122 samples from 33 plant families and more than 60 species
   were collected and analyzed for their nutritional content. The specific
   nutrient needs of black and white ruffed lemurs are unknown, but
   quantifying the nutritional composition of the foods they consume in the
   wild will help nutritionists and veterinarians formulate more
   appropriate diets for captive ruffed lemurs. This information will also
   supply information on how man-induced habitat changes affect the
   nutritional composition of foods consumed by free-ranging lemurs. Zoo

Title = {Signals of recent spatial expansions in the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus
   murinus)},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 22},
Abstract = {Background: Pleistocene events have shaped the phylogeography of many
   taxa worldwide. Their genetic signatures in tropical species have been
   much less explored than in those living in temperate regions. We
   analysed the genetic structure of a Malagasy primate species, a mouse
   lemur with a wide distribution (M. murinus), in order to investigate
   such phylogeographic processes on a large tropical island. We also
   evaluated the effects of anthropogenic pressures
   (fragmentation/deforestation) and natural features (geographic distance,
   rivers) on genetic structure in order to complement our understanding of
   past and present processes of genetic differentiation.
   Results: The analysis of the mitochondrial D-loop sequences of 195
   samples from 15 study sites (10 from a continuous forest and five from
   isolated forest fragments) from two adjacent Inter-River-Systems (IRSs)
   revealed that forest fragmentation and the river restrict gene flow,
   thereby leading to an increased genetic differentiation between
   populations beyond the effect of isolation-by-distance. Demographic
   simulations detected signals of two successive spatial expansions that
   could be preliminarily dated to the late Pleistocene and early Holocene.
   The haplotype network revealed geographic structure and showed deep
   molecular divergences within and between the IRSs that would be
   congruent with a two-step colonization scenario.
   Conclusions: This study supports the hypothesis of a relatively recent
   spatial expansion of the grey mouse lemur in northwestern Madagascar,
   which may also explain why this taxon, in contrast to its congeners, has
   not yet undergone allopatric speciation in the studied area and possibly
   across its presently wide range.},

Abstract = {During moderate calorie restriction (CR) the heterotherm Microcebus
   murinus is able to maintain a stable energy balance whatever the season,
   even if only wintering animals enter into torpor. To understand its
   energy saving strategies to respond to food shortages, we assessed
   protein and energy metabolisms associated with wintering torpor
   expression or summering torpor avoidance. We investigated body
   composition, whole body protein turnover, and daily energy expenditure
   (DEE), during a graded (40 and 80\%) 35-day CR in short-days (winter;
   SD40 and SD80, respectively) and long-days (summer; LD40 and LD80,
   respectively) acclimated animals. LD40 animals showed no change in fat
   mass (FM) but a 12\% fat free mass (FFM) reduction. Protein balance
   being positive after CR, the FFM loss was early and rapid. The 25\% DEE
   reduction, in LD40 group was mainly explained by FFM changes. LD80
   animals showed a steady body mass loss and were excluded from the CR
   trial at day 22, reaching a survival-threatened body mass. No data were
   available for this group. SD40 animals significantly decreased their FM
   level by 21\%, but maintained FFM. Protein sparing was achieved through
   a 35 and 39\% decrease in protein synthesis and catabolism (protein
   turnover), respectively, overall maintaining nitrogen balance. The 21\%
   reduction in energy requirement was explained by the 30\% nitrogen flux
   drop but also by torpor as DEE FFM-adjusted remained 13\% lower compared
   to ad-libitum. SD80 animals were unable to maintain energy and nitrogen
   balances, losing both FM and FFM. Thus summering mouse lemurs
   equilibrate energy balance by a rapid loss of active metabolic mass
   without using torpor, whereas wintering animals spare protein and energy
   through increased torpor expression. Both strategies have direct fitness
   implication: 1) to maintain activities at a lower body size during the
   mating season and 2) to preserve an optimal wintering muscle mass and
   function.},

Abstract = {Exudates represent an important component of the natural diets of
   small-bodied primates. For mouse lemurs, the impact of forest type and
   seasonal predictability on gum consumption has recently been intensively
   investigated. The goal of our study was to extend our knowledge
   regarding the seasonality of feeding ecology of Microcebus murinus,
   first, to investigate the relative consumption of gum and hemipteran
   honeydew, a sap-derived product, and, second to assess respective
   foraging strategies in a highly seasonal and quite predictable
   environment. We hypothesized that (1) food resources vary according to
   the season, (2) gum and honeydew represent keystone food resources
   during periods of food scarcity, and (3) lemurs revisit productive
   stationary feeding sites during the period of food scarcity. We studied
   gray mouse lemurs in the dry deciduous forest of the Ankarafantsika
   National Park in northwestern Madagascar. We radio-collared seven M.
   murinus females and performed focal observations on their feeding
   behavior during the end of the dry and the beginning of the rainy
   season. During the dry season, the period of food scarcity, mouse lemurs
   mainly consumed gum and honeydew. Subjects revisited the same feeding
   sites within the same and over several nights. During the rainy season,
   the period of food abundance, lemurs consumed mainly nectar from shrub
   flowers and did not show gum or honeydew feeding. To our knowledge, the
   consumption of honeydew by lemurs is a unique case of sap feeding by
   proxy in a mammal. Further investigations will focus on the
   characterization of the ecological consequences of such an interaction
   between mouse lemurs, hemipteran larvae, and host plants.},

Title = {Leaf Nest Use and Construction in the Golden-Brown Mouse Lemur

Abstract = {The use of leaf nests has been documented in several mouse lemur species
   over the last few decades, including the golden-brown mouse lemur. Nest
   construction, however, has only rarely been observed and detailed
   descriptions of this process are lacking so far. We aim to determine the
   relative importance of leaf nests as shelters for the golden-brown mouse
   lemur, and to test predictions concerning the role of thermoregulation,
   safety (i.e., protection of infants), and of interspecific competition
   with the sympatric gray mouse lemurs in regulating nest use. Finally, we
   intend to clarify whether and how Microcebus ravelobensis constructs the
   nests, and we provide physical descriptions of seven leaf nests.
   Nocturnal focal observations were carried out from May 2007 to January
   2008 on 18 females, and sleeping sites were regularly monitored during a
   six-month period. Data were collected from two study sites, one with
   exclusive presence of M. ravelobensis, and one with co-existence of the
   two mouse lemur species. Sixty-five out of 379 identified daily sleeping
   sites were leaf nests. These represented a total of 35 different leaf
   nests, used by 15 out of 18 females. The relative leaf nest use differed
   between sites during five out of six months, but without a consistent
   pattern. Interspecific competition can therefore not explain leaf nest
   use. Leaf nest use differed seasonally and may be partly explained by
   thermoregulatory advantages in the site with lower minimum temperatures.
   Nest use was furthermore higher than expected in both sites during the
   rearing season that indicates the role of nests in infant protection.
   For the first time, we could confirm that golden-brown mouse lemurs
   build leaf nests themselves. Nest building lasted between 46 and 68 min,
   which shows that this task is time consuming and therefore probably
   costly. Am. J. Primatol. 72:48-55, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Assessment of Organochlorine Pesticides and Metals in Ring-Tailed Lemurs

Abstract = {Like most of Madagascar's endemic primates, ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur
   catta) face a number of threats to their survival. Although habitat loss
   is of greatest concern, other anthropogenic factors including
   environmental contamination may also affect lemur health and survival.
   In this study, we examined ring-tailed lemurs from the Beza Mahafaly
   Special Reserve (BMSR), southern Madagascar for exposure to
   organochlorine (OC) pesticides and metals and examined differences in
   contaminant concentrations between sexes and among age groups, troops,
   and habitats. A total of 14 pesticides and 13 metals was detected in
   lemur blood (24 individuals) and hair (65 individuals) samples,
   respectively. p,p'-DDT, heptachlor, aldrin, heptachlor epoxide, endrin
   aldehyde, and endrin were among the most prevalent pesticides detected.
   Surprisingly, the persistent metabolite of p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, was not
   detected. The most commonly detected metals were aluminum, zinc, boron,
   phosphorus, silicon, and copper, whereas metals considered more
   hazardous to wildlife (e.g. arsenic, cadmium, lead, selenium, vanadium)
   were not found above detection limits. Overall, concentrations of OC
   pesticides and metals were low and similar to those considered to be
   background concentrations in other studies examining the ecotoxicology
   of wild mammals. Few inter-sex, -age, -troop, and -habitat differences
   in contaminant concentrations were observed, suggesting a uniform
   distribution of contaminants within the reserve. Several statistically
   significant relationships between lemur body size and contaminant
   concentrations were observed, but owing to the lack of supportive data
   regarding contaminant exposure in wild primates, the biological
   significance of these findings remains uncertain. Results of this study
   document exposure of ring-tailed lemurs at BMSR to multiple OC
   pesticides and metals and provide essential baseline data for future
   health and toxicological evaluations of lemurs and other wild primates,
   especially those in regions with expanding agricultural and mining
   operations. Am. J. Primatol. 71:998-1010, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {Both human infants and adult non-human primates share the capacity to
   track small numbers of objects across time and occlusion. The question
   now facing developmental and comparative psychologists is whether
   similar mechanisms give rise to this capacity across the two
   populations. Here, we explore whether non-human primates' object
   tracking abilities are subject to the same constraints as those of human
   infants. In particular, we examine whether one primate species, the
   brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus), also fails to represent and enumerate
   objects when they behave non-rigidly or non-cohesively. We presented
   lemurs with a series of expectancy violation studies involving simple 1
   + 1 addition events in which we varied the entities to be enumerated.
   Like infants, lemurs successfully enumerated the two objects when those
   objects were rigid, cohesive individuals, but failed to enumerate
   similar-looking non-rigid piles of sand. In contrast to human infants,
   however, lemurs successfully enumerated non-cohesive objects that broke
   into multiple pieces. These results are discussed in light of recent
   theories about object processing in human infants and adults.},

   2009; doi: 10.1152/ajpregu.00214.2009.-This study investigated the
   extent to which the increase in torpor expression in the grey mouse
   lemur, due to graded food restriction, is modulated by a trade-off
   between a whole body sparing of polyunsaturated dietary fatty acids and
   the related oxidative stress generated during daily torpor. We measured
   changes in torpor frequency, total energy expenditure (TEE), linoleate
   (polyunsaturated fatty acid) and palmitate (saturated fatty acid)
   oxidation, hexanoyl-lysine (HEL; the product of linoleate peroxidation),
   and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8OHdG; a marker of DNA damage). Animals
   under summer-acclimated long days (LD) or winter-acclimated short days
   (SD) were exposed to a 40\% (LD40 and SD40) and 80\% (LD80 and SD80)
   35-day calorie restriction (CR). During CR, all groups reduced their
   body mass, but LD80 animals reached survival-threatened levels at day 22
   and were then excluded from the CR trial. Only SD mouse lemurs increased
   their torpor frequency with CR and displayed a decrease in their TEE
   adjusted for fat-free mass. After CR, SD40 mouse lemurs shifted the
   dietary fatty acid oxidation toward palmitate and spared linoleate. Such
   a shift was not observed in LD animals and during severe CR, during
   which oxidation of both dietary fatty acids was increased.
   Concomitantly, HEL increased in both LD40 and SD80 groups, whereas DNA
   damage was only seen in SD80 food-restricted animals. HEL correlated
   positively with linoleate oxidation confirming in vivo the
   substrate/product relationship demonstrated in vitro, and negatively
   with TEE adjusted for fat-free mass, suggesting higher oxidative stress
   associated with increased torpor expression. This suggests a
   seasonal-dependant, cost-benefit trade-off between maximizing torpor
   propensity and minimizing oxidative stress that is associated with a
   shift toward sparing of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids that is
   dependent upon the expression of a winter phenotype.},

Abstract = {The spiny forest of southwestern Madagascar is the driest and most
   unpredictable region of the island. It is characterized by a pronounced
   seasonality with high fluctuations in ambient temperature, low
   availability of food, and a lack of water during the cool dry season
   and, additionally, by changes in environmental conditions between years.
   One of the few mammalian species that manages to inhabit this
   challenging habitat is the reddish-gray mouse lemur (Microcebus
   griseorufus). The aim of our study was to determine whether this small
   primate uses continuous hibernation as an energy saving strategy, and if
   so, to characterize its physiological properties. We measured skin
   temperature of 16 free-ranging individuals continuously over 3 months
   during the cool dry season using collar temperature data loggers.
   Prolonged hibernation was found in three mouse lemurs and was not sex
   dependent (one male, two females). Skin temperature of hibernating
   individuals tracked ambient temperature passively with a minimum skin
   temperature of 6.5A degrees C and fluctuated strongly each day (up to
   20A degrees C), depending on the insulation capacity of the hibernacula.
   Individuals remained in continuous hibernation even at an ambient
   temperature of 37A degrees C. The animals hibernated continuously during
   the dry season, and hibernation bouts were only interrupted by short
   spontaneous arousals. The study emphasizes that hibernation is an
   important measure to counter environmental challenge for more tropical
   species than previously thought, including primates. It furthermore
   provides evidence that tropical hibernation is functionally similar
   among tropical species.},

Abstract = {Severe dental wear and tooth loss is often assumed to impede the
   processing, breakdown, and energetic conversion of food items, thereby
   negatively impacting individual health, reproduction, and survival.
   Ring-tailed lemurs at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve demonstrate
   exceptionally high frequencies of severe dental wear and antemortem
   tooth loss, yet often survive multiple years with these impairments. To
   test the hypothesis that these lemurs mitigate tooth loss through
   behavioral adjustments, we collected 191 h of observational data from 16
   focal subjects, eight without tooth loss and eight with between 3\% and
   44\% loss. These data indicate dentally-impaired ring-tailed lemurs show
   compensatory behaviors consistent with the demands of living in a social
   group. During early afternoon (12:00-14:30 h) individuals with loss
   showed trends towards higher frequencies of foraging and grooming, while
   individuals without loss rested significantly more often. Individuals
   with >10\% loss (n 7) showed higher frequencies of feeding, foraging,
   and grooming, and lower frequencies of resting during this period than
   individuals with <10\% loss (n = 9). Individuals with tooth loss
   maintained relatively higher levels of feeding and foraging throughout
   the day. These individuals licked tamarind fruit at higher frequencies,
   likely spending more time softening it before ingestion. These
   individuals did not demonstrate longer feeding bouts overall, although
   bouts involving tamarinds were significantly longer. Individuals with
   marked toothcomb wear engaged in higher rates of certain types of
   allogrooming, demonstrating that social behaviors are used to compensate
   for reduced grooming efficiency. These data have implications for
   interpreting behavioral responses to dental impairment in the fossil
   record. Am J Phys Anthropol 140:120-134, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to describe the anatomy and obtain
   echographic measurements of normal kidneys in brown lemurs (Eulemur
   fulvus). The anatomical findings show that brown lemur kidneys are
   comparable to those of rats except for an elongated papilla. The kidneys
   of 16 (7 females and 9 males) lemurs were examined with two-dimensional
   and power Doppler ultrasonography under general anesthesia.
   Morphometrically, the left and right kidney surface areas are comparable
   (3.29 and 3.51 cm(2)). Kidney area has a significant linear correlation
   with body weight. Echo-Doppler findings show that the mean renal
   arterial blood flow speeds for the left and right kidneys are comparable
   (0.70 and 0.73m/s). However, flow speed is higher in the male (0.79m/s)
   than in the female (0.60m/s). The renal arterial diameters are between
   1.0 and 1.8 mm. The fact that anesthesia can have hemodynamic effects on
   renal vasculature should be taken into consideration when assessing
   these echographic results. Am. J. Primatol. 71:647-653, 2009. (C) 2009

Title = {Spatial memory in the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus)},

Abstract = {Wild animals face the challenge of locating feeding sites distributed
   across broad spatial and temporal scales. Spatial memory allows animals
   to find a goal, such as a productive feeding patch, even when there are
   no goal-specific sensory cues available. Because there is little
   experimental information on learning and memory capabilities in
   free-ranging primates, the aim of this study was to test whether grey
   mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), as short-term dietary specialists,
   rely on spatial memory in relocating productive feeding sites. In
   addition, we asked what kind of spatial representation might underlie
   their orientation in their natural environment. Using an experimental
   approach, we set eight radio-collared grey mouse lemurs a memory task by
   confronting them with two different spatial patterns of baited and
   non-baited artificial feeding stations under exclusion of sensory cues.
   Positional data were recorded by focal animal observations within a grid
   system of small foot trails. A change in the baiting pattern revealed
   that grey mouse lemurs primarily used spatial cues to relocate baited
   feeding stations and that they were able to rapidly learn a new spatial
   arrangement. Spatially concentrated, non-random movements revealed
   preliminary evidence for a route-based restriction in mouse lemur space;
   during a subsequent release experiment, however, we found high travel
   efficiency in directed movements. We therefore propose that mouse lemur
   spatial memory is based on some kind of mental representation that is
   more detailed than a route-based network map.},

Title = {Brief Communication: Blue Eyes in Lemurs and Humans: Same Phenotype,

Abstract = {Almost all mammals have brown or darkly-pigmented eyes (irises), but
   among primates, there are some prominent blue-eyed exceptions. The blue
   eyes of some humans and lemurs are a striking example of convergent
   evolution of a rare phenotype on distant branches of the primate tree.
   Recent work on humans indicates that blue eye color is associated with,
   and likely caused by, a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs12913832) in
   an intron of the gene HERC2, which likely regulates expression of the
   neighboring pigmentation gene OCA2. This raises the immediate question
   of whether blue eyes in lemurs might have a similar genetic basis. We
   addressed this by sequencing the homologous genetic region in the
   blue-eyed black lemur (Eulemur macaco flavifrons; N = 4) and the
   closely-related black lemur (Eulemur macaco macaco; N 4), which has
   brown eyes. We then compared a 166-bp segment corresponding to and
   flanking the human eyecolor-associated region in these lemurs, as well
   as other primates (human, chimpanzee, orangutan, macaque, ring-tailed
   lemur, mouse lemur). Aligned sequences indicated that this region is
   strongly conserved in both Eulemur macaco subspecies as well as the
   other primates (except blue-eyed humans). Therefore, it is unlikely that
   this regulatory segment plays a major role in eye color differences
   among lemurs as it does in humans. Although convergent phenotypes can
   sometimes come about via the same or similar genetic changes occurring
   independently, this does not seem to be the case here, as we have shown
   that the genetic basis of blue eyes in lemurs differs from that of
   humans. Am J Phys Anthropol 139:269-273, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Among the order of primates, torpor has been described only for the
   small Malagasy cheirogaleids Microcebus and Cheirogaleus. The nocturnal,
   gray mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus (approx. 60 g), is capable of
   entering into and spontaneously arousing from apparently daily torpor
   during the dry season in response to reduced temperatures and low food
   and water sources. Mark-recapture studies indicated that this primate
   species might also hibernate for several weeks, although physiological
   evidence is lacking. In the present study, we investigated patterns of
   body temperature in two free-ranging M. murinus during the austral
   winter using temperature-sensitive data loggers implanted subdermally.
   One lemur hibernated and remained inactive for 4 weeks. During this
   time, body temperature followed the ambient temperature passively with a
   minimum body temperature of 11.5A degrees C, interrupted by irregular
   arousals to normothermic levels. Under the same conditions, the second
   individual displayed only short bouts of torpor in the early morning
   hours but maintained stable normothermic body temperatures throughout
   its nocturnal activity. Reduction of body temperature was less
   pronounced in the mouse lemur that utilized short bouts of torpor with a
   minimum value of 27A degrees C. Despite the small sample size, our
   findings provide the first physiological confirmation that free-ranging
   individuals of M. murinus from the humid evergreen littoral rain forest
   have the option to utilize short torpor bouts or hibernation under the
   same conditions as two alternative energy-conserving physiological
   solutions to environmental constraints.},

Abstract = {Although primates have often been found to co-orient visually with other
   individuals, members of these same species have usually failed to use
   co-orientation to find hidden food in object-choice experiments. This
   presents an evolutionary puzzle: what is the function of co-orientation
   if it is not used for a function as basic as locating resources?
   Co-orientation responses have not been systematically investigated in
   object-choice experiments, and requiring co-orientation with humans (as
   is typical in object-choice tasks) may underestimate other species'
   abilities. Using an object-choice task with conspecific models depicted
   in photographs, we provide experimental evidence that two lemur species
   (Eulemur fulvus, n = 4, and Eulemur macaco, n = 2) co-orient with
   conspecifics. Secondly, by analysing together two measures that have
   traditionally been examined separately, we show that lemurs' gaze
   following behaviour and ultimate choice are closely linked. Individuals
   were more likely to choose correctly after having looked in the same
   direction as the model, and thus chose objects correctly more often than
   chance. We propose a candidate system for the evolutionary origins of
   more complex gaze following: `gaze priming.'.},

Abstract = {Many endotherms save energy during food and water shortage or
   unpredictable environment using controlled reductions in body
   temperature and metabolism called torpor. In this study, we measured
   energy metabolism and water turnover in free-ranging grey mouse lemurs
   Microcebus murinus (approximately 60 g) using doubly labelled water
   during the austral winter in the rain forest of southeastern Madagascar.
   We then compared patterns of thermal biology between grey mouse lemurs
   from the rain forest and a population from the dry forest. M. murinus
   from the rain forest, without a distinct dry season, entered daily
   torpor independent of ambient temperature (T (a)). There were no
   differences in torpor occurrence, duration and depth between M. murinus
   from the rain and dry forest. Mouse lemurs using daily torpor reduced
   their energy expenditure by 11\% in the rain forest and by 10.5\% in the
   dry forest, respectively. There was no significant difference in the
   mean water flux rates of mouse lemurs remaining normothermic between
   populations of both sites. In contrast, mean water flux rate of
   individuals from the dry forest that used torpor was significantly lower
   than those from the rain forest. This study represents the first account
   of energy expenditure, water flux and skin temperature (T (sk)) in
   free-ranging M. murinus from the rain forest. Our comparative findings
   suggest that water turnover and therefore water requirement during the
   austral winter months plays a more restricting role on grey mouse lemurs
   from the dry forest than on those from the rain forest.},

Abstract = {Giant bamboo (Cathariostachys madagascariensis) is a major food plant
   for three sympatric species of bamboo-eating lemurs (Hapalemur aureus,
   H. griseus, and Prolemur simus) in the rain forests of southeastern
   Madagascar. This plant species is strongly cyanogenic. However,
   quantitative data on cyanide concentration in C. madagascariensis are
   scarce. Previous studies reported 15 mg cyanide per 100 g fresh shoot
   material (corresponding to approx. 57 mu mol cyanide per gram dry
   weight). However, we found mean concentrations (+/- SE) ranging from
   139.3 +/- 19.32 in ground shoots to 217.7 +/- 16.80 mu mol cyanide per
   gram dry weight in branch shoots. Thus, cyanogenesis of C.
   madagascariensis was up to four times higher than reported before. In
   contrast to the strongly cyanogenic shoots no cyanide could be detected
   in differently aged leaves of C. madagascariensis confirming earlier
   studies. Within individual shoots fine-scaled analysis revealed a
   characteristic ontogenetic pattern of cyanide accumulation. Highest
   concentrations were found in youngest parts near the apical meristem,
   whereas concentrations decreased in older shoot parts. Beyond the
   general intra-individual variability of cyanogenic features analyses
   indicated site-specific variability of both, the ontogenetic pattern of
   cyanide concentration as well as the total amount of cyanide accumulated
   in shoots. Additionally, analyses of soluble proteins-one important
   nutritive measure affecting food plant quality-demonstrated a converse
   quantitative relation of protein concentrations in leaves to cyanide

   allow obtaining more detailed insights into spatial variability of giant

Abstract = {Object permanence, the ability to mentally represent objects that have
   disappeared from view, should be advantageous to animals in their
   interaction with the natural world. The objective of this study was to
   examine whether lemurs possess object permanence. Thirteen adult
   subjects representing four species of diurnal lemur (Eulemur fulvus
   rufus, Eulemur mongoz, Lemur catta and Hapalemur griseus) were presented
   with seven standard Piagetian visible and invisible object displacement
   tests, plus one single visible test where the subject had to wait
   predetermined times before allowed to search, and two invisible tests
   where each hiding place was made visually unique. In all visible tests
   lemurs were able to find an object that had been in clear view before
   being hidden. However, when lemurs were not allowed to search for up to
   25-s, performance declined with increasing time-delay. Subjects did not
   outperform chance on any invisible displacements regardless of whether
   hiding places were visually uniform or unique, therefore the upper limit
   of object permanence observed was Stage 5b. Lemur species in this study
   eat stationary foods and are not subject to stalking predators, thus
   Stage 5 object permanence is probably sufficient to solve most problems
   encountered in the wild.},

Title = {Parallel Germline Infiltration of a Lentivirus in Two Malagasy Lemurs},
Journal = {PLOS GENETICS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Retroviruses normally infect the somatic cells of their host and are
   transmitted horizontally, i.e., in an exogenous way. Occasionally,
   however, some retroviruses can also infect and integrate into the genome
   of germ cells, which may allow for their vertical inheritance and
   fixation in a given species; a process known as endogenization.
   Lentiviruses, a group of mammalian retroviruses that includes HIV, are
   known to infect primates, ruminants, horses, and cats. Unlike many other
   retroviruses, these viruses have not been demonstrably successful at
   germline infiltration. Here, we report on the discovery of endogenous
   lentiviral insertions in seven species of Malagasy lemurs from two
   different genera-Cheirogaleus and Microcebus. Combining molecular clock
   analyses and cross-species screening of orthologous insertions, we show
   that the presence of this endogenous lentivirus in six species of
   Microcebus is the result of one endogenization event that occurred about
   4.2 million years ago. In addition, we demonstrate that this lentivirus
   independently infiltrated the germline of Cheirogaleus and that the two
   endogenization events occurred quasi-simultaneously. Using multiple
   proviral copies, we derive and characterize an apparently full length
   and intact consensus for this lentivirus. These results provide evidence
   that lentiviruses have repeatedly infiltrated the germline of prosimian
   species and that primates have been exposed to lentiviruses for a much
   longer time than what can be inferred based on sequence comparison of
   circulating lentiviruses. The study sets the stage for an unprecedented
   opportunity to reconstruct an ancestral primate lentivirus and thereby
   advance our knowledge of host-virus interactions.},

Title = {Genetic analysis of hybridization and introgression between wild
   mongoose and brown lemurs},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {Background: Hybrid zones generally represent areas of secondary contact
   after speciation. The nature of the interaction between genes of
   individuals in a hybrid zone is of interest in the study of evolutionary
   processes. In this study, data from nuclear microsatellites and
   mitochondrial DNA sequences were used to genetically characterize
   hybridization between wild mongoose lemurs (Eulemur mongoz) and brown
   lemurs (E. fulvus) at Anjamena in west Madagascar.
   Results: Two segments of mtDNA have been sequenced and 12 microsatellite
   loci screened in 162 brown lemurs and mongoose lemurs. Among the
   mongoose lemur population at Anjamena, we identified two F1 hybrids (one
   also having the mtDNA haplotype of E. fulvus) and six other individuals
   with putative introgressed alleles in their genotype. Principal
   component analysis groups both hybrids as intermediate between E. mongoz
   and E. fulvus and admixture analyses revealed an admixed genotype for
   both animals. Paternity testing proved one F1 hybrid to be fertile. Of
   the eight brown lemurs genotyped, all have either putative introgressed
   microsatellite alleles and/or the mtDNA haplotype of E. mongoz.
   Conclusion: Introgression is bidirectional for the two species, with an
   indication that it is more frequent in brown lemurs than in mongoose
   lemurs. We conclude that this hybridization occurs because mongoose
   lemurs have expanded their range relatively recently. Introgressive
   hybridization may play an important role in the unique lemur radiation,
   as has already been shown in other rapidly evolving animals.},

Title = {Hybridization between mouse lemurs in an ecological transition zone in
   southern Madagascar},
Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Hybrid zones in ecotones can be useful model systems for the study of
   evolutionary processes that shape the distribution and discreteness of
   species. Such studies could be important for an improved understanding
   of the complex biogeography of Madagascar, which is renowned for its
   outstanding degree of small-scale endemism. Certain forest remnants in
   central Madagascar indicate that transitional corridors across the
   island could have connected microendemics in different forest types in
   the past. Evolutionary processes in such corridors are difficult to
   study because most of these corridors have disappeared due to
   deforestation in central Madagascar. We studied a hybrid zone in one of
   the few remaining ecotonal corridors between dry and humid forests in
   Madagascar, which connects two species of mouse lemurs, Microcebus
   griseorufus in dry spiny forest and Microcebus murinus in humid littoral
   forest. We sampled 162 mouse lemurs at nine sites across this boundary.
   Morphometric analyses revealed intermediate morphotypes of many
   individuals in transitional habitat. Bayesian clustering of
   microsatellite genotypes and assignment tests yielded evidence for a
   mixed ancestry of mouse lemurs in the ecotone, where we also observed
   significant linkage disequilibria and heterozygote deficiency. In
   contrast to these observations, mitochondrial haplotypes displayed a
   sharply delimited boundary at the eastern edge of spiny forest, which
   was noncoincident with the signals from microsatellite data. Among
   several alternative scenarios, we propose asymmetric nuclear
   introgression due to male-biased dispersal, divergent environmental
   selection, and an expansion of dry spiny forest in the course of
   aridification as a probable explanation of our observations.},

Abstract = {In the Gray Mouse Lemur, a nocturnal Malagasy primate, nest sharing
   during the diurnal sleeping period provides significant thermoregulatory
   advantages. Using socially housed captive male mouse lemurs, we tested
   the hypothesis that males would present differential physiological
   parameters depending oil their nest sharing patterns at the beginning of
   the breeding season. Nest composition, and health status inferred from
   body weight, reproductive activity (testis width) and level of immune
   activity (lymphocyte number) were recorded at the beginning of the
   breeding season and after 4 weeks in newly formed 4 groups of 5 adult
   males. One nest was occupied by 3 males or more in 85\% of the surveys,
   and 14 cases of males found alone in a nest were recorded, distributed
   over 65\% of the surveys. Males found alone or in pairs lost
   significantly more weight after the 4 weeks of social grouping than
   males found in groups of 3 or more individuals in a nest. Additionally,
   males expelled from common nests had reduced immune activity prior to
   social grouping than nest associated males. Nest associated males had
   little change in their lymphocyte numbers after the 4 weeks of social
   grouping, whereas isolated males exhibited a pronounced increase in
   lymphocyte numbers. These results indicate that, in mouse lemurs,
   nest-sharing pattern at the beginning of the breeding season is a
   complex process, yielding diverse energetic and immunological
   consequences.},

Title = {What Is It Going to Be? Pattern and Potential Function of Natal Coat
   Change in Sexually Dichromatic Redfronted Lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus)},

Abstract = {In some primate species, pelage colorations at birth contrast with adult
   colorations. The intensity of natal coats and their phylogenetic
   distribution is highly variable within primates. Natal coat coloration
   seems to change to adult coloration in most species when infants become
   independent from their mothers, but an accepted functional explanation
   for natal coats is not available. Here we describe pelage coloration
   change in sexually dichromatic redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus)
   in Kirindy Forest, and propose a new functional hypothesis for this
   phenomenon. In this species, infants are born with adult male coloration
   and female infants subsequently undergo a change in coloration. Using
   digital pictures and behavioral data collected on eight mother-offspring
   dyads from birth until the end of the coloration change, we 1) described
   timing and pattern of pelage development in redfronted lemur infants and
   2) examined behavioral developmental correlates of the coloration
   change. The color change took place between 7 and 17 weeks of age and
   coincided with advanced physical independence; a pattern also found in
   monochromatic primate species with natal coats. No behavioral
   differences between male and female infants were found. Hypotheses about
   the ultimate function of natal coats focusing on enhanced infant care or
   reduced infanticide risk did not explain the pelage change in redfronted
   lemurs. The natal pelage pattern in this species may instead serve as
   sexual mimicry. Accordingly, female infants may mimic males during the
   most vulnerable developmental phase to avoid sex-specific aggression by
   adult females in a species with intense female-female aggression and
   competition. Am J Phys Anthropol 138:1-10, 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {Potential implications of gut hormones in body mass and torpor and
   behavioral pattern changes induced by an incremental (40 and 80\%)
   calorie restriction (CR) in long-days (LD, summer) and short-days (SD,
   winter) were investigated in gray mouse lemurs. Only 80\% food-deprived
   LD and SD animals showed a continuous mass loss resulting in a 10 and
   15\% mass reduction, respectively. Ghrelin levels of all food-deprived
   groups increased by 2.6-fold on average and remained high after
   re-feeding while peptide YY (PYY) levels increased by 3.8-fold only in
   LD animals under 80\% CR. In the re-fed SD group, body mass was
   positively associated with ghrelin and negatively associated with PYY,
   while no correlations were noted in the re-fed LD animals. Plasma
   glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) increased by 2.9-fold only in LD
   food-restricted mouse lemurs and was negatively associated with the
   minimal body temperature. No significant correlations were reported in
   food-deprived SD animals. These results suggest that ghrelin, PYY and
   GLP-1 may be related to pre-wintering fattening mechanisms and to the
   modulation of torpor expression, respectively. Such observation clearly
   warrants further investigations, but it opens an interesting area of
   research in torpor regulation.},

Abstract = {Species of Lemureops gem. nov. (type species: L. kilbeyi sp. nov.) are

   Strigigenalis plicolabeona, Carolinites nevadensis and Presbynileus
   ibexensis trilobite zones in the upper Fillmore Formation of the Ibex
   area, western Utah. The genus is defined by several striking
   apomorphies, including a long, subtriangular anterior border; large
   subtriangular to reniform palpebro-ocular ridges; a wide, shallow,
   lacunate axial furrow along the glabella; an anteriorly prominent and
   posteriorly reduced eye socle; and a pygidium with a strongly tapered
   posterior outline. Lemureops is likely the sister taxon of Pseudocybele
   Ross, 195 la, but this hypothesis must be tested in a broader
   phylogenetic context once Pseudocybele is revised and related taxa
   presently assigned to Hintzeia Harrington, 1957, and Protopliomerella
   Harrington, 1957, are described and revised. New species in addition to
   the type are L. willsonpiperi, L. ploogi and L. koppesi; Psendocybele
   lemurei Hintze, 1953, is reassigned to Lemureops. Two additional species
   are new, but insufficiently known for formal naming.},

Abstract = {Natal dispersal reduces the risk of inbreeding, since it is typically
   biased towards one sex. Golden-brown mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   ravelobensis) form mixed-sex sleeping groups whose genetic composition
   is not yet known. This study investigates the composition of eight
   sleeping groups and the dispersal pattern in a free-living population of
   this nocturnal primate. Genetic relatedness and parentage was calculated
   for 101 individuals (43 males, 58 females) based on microsatellite
   analyses. Matrilinear relatedness played a major role in the composition
   of sleeping groups. Co-sleepers were significantly more closely related
   than members of different sleeping groups. Dispersal was not strongly
   biased towards one sex. More than 50\% of all potential sons (N = 19)
   and daughters (N = 26) remained in their natal range well into their
   first mating season, but potential sons disappeared more frequently than
   daughters lateron. These data indicate that many sons may have delayed
   their dispersal. This delayed dispersal may have increased the risk of
   inbreeding, since closely related males and females stayed within one
   home range diameter of each other quite regularly in the mating season.
   In fact, two definite cases of inbreeding were detected. The likely
   benefits of delayed dispersal are discussed in view of the confirmed
   cases of inbreeding.},

Title = {Daily Rhythms of Core Temperature and Locomotor Activity Indicate
   Different Adaptive Strategies to Cold Exposure in Adult and Aged Mouse
   Lemurs Acclimated to a Summer-Like Photoperiod},
Journal = {CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {838-853},
Abstract = {Daily variations in core temperature (Tc) within the normothermic range
   imply thermoregulatory processes that are essential for optimal function
   and survival. Higher susceptibility towards cold exposure in older
   animals suggests that these processes are disturbed with age. In the
   mouse lemur, a long-day breeder, we tested whether aging affected
   circadian rhythmicity of Tc, locomotor activity (LA), and energy balance
   under long-day conditions when exposed to cold. Adult (N = 7) and aged
   (N = 5) mouse lemurs acclimated to LD14/10 were exposed to 10-day
   periods at 25 and 12 degrees C. Tc and LA rhythms were recorded by
   telemetry, and caloric intake (CI), body mass changes, and plasma IGF-1
   were measured. During exposure to 25 degrees C, both adult and aged
   mouse lemurs exhibited strong daily variations in Tc. Aged animals
   exhibited lower levels of nocturnal LA and nocturnal and diurnal Tc
   levels in comparison to adults. Body mass and IGF-1 levels remained
   unchanged with aging. Under cold exposure, torpor bout occurrence was
   never observed whatever the age category. Adult and aged mouse lemurs
   maintained their Tc in the normothermic range and a positive energy
   balance. All animals exhibited increase in CI and decrease in IGF-1 in
   response to cold. The decrease in IGF-1 was delayed in aged mouse lemurs
   compared to adults. Moreover, both adult and aged animals responded to
   cold exposure by increasing their diurnal LA compared to those under Ta
   = 25 degrees C. However, aged animals exhibited a strong decrease in
   nocturnal LA and Tc, whereas cold effects were only slight in adults.
   The temporal organization and amplitude of the daily phase of low Tc
   were particularly well preserved under cold exposure in both age groups.
   Sexually active mouse lemurs exposed to cold thus seemed to prevent
   torpor exhibition and temporal disorganization of daily rhythms of Tc,
   even during aging. However, although energy balance was not impaired
   with age in mouse lemurs after cold exposure, aging was associated with
   lower LA and Tc during the night and delayed decrease in IGF-1. This
   might reflect that adaptive strategies to cold exposure differ with age
   in mouse lemurs acclimated to a summer-like photoperiod.},

Title = {Opsin Gene Polymorphism Predicts Trichromacy in a Cathemeral Lemur},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {86-90},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Recent research has identified polymorphic trichromacy in three diurnal
   strepsirrhines: Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli), black and
   white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata), and red ruffed lemurs (V.
   rubra). Current hypotheses suggest that the transitions to diurnality
   experienced by Propithecus and Varecia were necessary precursors to
   their independent acquisitions of trichromacy. Accordingly, cathemeral
   lemurs are thought to lack the M/L opsin gene polymorphism necessary for
   trichromacy. In this study, the M/L opsin gene was sequenced in ten
   cathemeral blue-eyed black lemurs (Eulemur macaco flavifrons). This
   analysis identified a polymorphism identical to that of other
   trichromatic strepsirrhines at the critical amino acid position 285 in
   exon 5 of the M/L opsin gene. Thus, polymorphic trichromacy is likely
   present in at least one cathemeral Eulemur species, suggesting that
   strict diurnality is not necessary for trichromacy. The presence of
   trichromacy in E. m. flavifrons suggests that a re-evaluation of current
   hypotheses regarding the evolution of strepsirrhine trichromacy may be
   necessary. Although the M/L opsin polymorphism may have been
   independently acquired three times in the lemurid-indriid clade, the
   distribution of opsin alleles in lemurids and indriids may also be
   consistent with a common origin of trichromacy in the last common
   ancestor of either the lemurids or the lemurid-indriid clade. Am. J.

Journal = {PEPTIDES},

Abstract = {A peptide with the ability to release insulin from the rat BRIN-BD11
   clonal beta cell line was isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin
   secretions of the Lemur leaf frog Hylomantis lemur Boulenger, 1882.
   Determination of the primary structure (FLSLIPHVISALSSL.NH2)
   demonstrated that the peptide belongs to the phylloseptin family whose
   members have previously been identified in other Phyllomedusinae
   species. A synthetic replicate of the peptide, termed phylloseptin-L2,
   produced a significant stimulation of insulin release (134\% of basal
   rate, P < 0.01) from BRIN-BD11 cells at a concentration of 30 nM, with a
   maximum response (301\% of basal rate, P < 0.001) at a concentration of
   3 mu M. Phylloseptin-L2 did not stimulate release of the cytosolic
   enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase at concentrations up to 3 mu M, indicating
   that the integrity of the plasma membrane had been preserved. The
   stimulatory action was maintained in the absence of extracellular Ca2+
   and in the presence of veraparmil (50 mu M) and diazoxide (300 mu M)
   suggesting that mechanism of action of the peptide did not primarily
   involve influx of Ca2+ or closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels.
   Administration of phylloseptin-L2 (50nmol/kg body weight) into mice
   significantly (P < 0.05) increased total release of insulin and improved
   glucose tolerance during the 60 min period following an intraperitoneal
   injection of glucose (18 mmol/kg body weight). It is concluded that the
   peptide shows potential for development into a therapeutically valuable
   agent for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {A realistic understanding of primate morphological adaptations requires
   a multidisciplinary approach including experimental studies of
   physiological performance and field studies documenting natural
   behaviors and reproductive success. For primate feeding, integrative
   efforts combining experimental and ecological approaches are rare. We
   discuss methods for collecting maximum bite forces in the field as part
   of an integrated ecomorphological research design. Specifically, we
   compare maximum biting ability in 3 sympatric bamboo lemurs (Hapalemur
   simus, H. aureus, and H. griseus) at Ranomafana National Park,
   Madagascar to determine if biting performance contributes to the
   observed partitioning of a shared bamboo diet. We assessed performance
   by recording maximum bite forces via jaw-muscle stimulations in
   anesthetized subjects from each species. Behavioral observations and
   food properties testing show that the largest species, Hapalemur simus,
   consumes the largest and most mechanically challenging foods. Our
   results suggest that Hapalemur simus can generate larger bite forces on
   average than those of the 2 smaller species. However, the overlap in
   maximum biting ability between Hapalemur simus and H. aureus indicates
   that biting performance cannot be the sole factor driving dietary
   segregation. Though maximum bite force does not fully explain dietary
   segregation, we hypothesize that size-related increases in both maximum
   bite force and jaw robusticity provide Hapalemur simus with an improved
   ability to process routinely its more obdurate diet. We demonstrate the
   feasibility of collecting physiological, ecological, and morphological
   data on the same free-ranging primates in their natural habitats.
   Integrating traditionally laboratory-based approaches with field studies
   broadens the range of potential primate species for physiological
   research and fosters improved tests of hypothesized feeding adaptations.},

Abstract = {Although the number of described lemur species has increased
   considerably over the last 20 years, detailed biogeographic data are
   still lacking from many geographic regions, in particular in the eastern
   part of Madagascar. This study investigated mouse lemur species
   diversity in a previously unstudied Inter-River-System in the eastern
   Makira region. Three sites were visited and 26 individuals were sampled
   and characterized with 13 external morphometric measurements. Standard
   phylogenetic analyses were performed on the basis of sequences of three
   mitochondrial loci by including representatives of all other published
   mouse lemur species for comparison. The analyses revealed the presence
   of three mouse lemur species in one study site, two of which were
   previously undescribed. The two new species are genetically distinct and
   belong to the larger-bodied mouse lemur species on the island, whereas
   the third species, Microcebus mittermeieri, belongs to the
   smaller-bodied mouse lemur species. The study fully describes one of the
   new species. This study and other lemur inventories suggest that the
   Makira region is particularly rich in lemur species and the lack of any
   protected zone in this area should now attract the urgent attention of
   conservation stakeholders. Am. J. Primatol. 70:1033-1046, 2008. (c) 2008

Abstract = {This study presents the first detailed morphometric measurements of wild
   caught black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata) from the
   eastern rainforests of Madagascar and aims to quantify the morphological
   variation present throughout their recognized range. One hundred and
   forty-four adult and juvenile individuals from 15 sites were sampled for
   20 cranial, dental and postcranial morphometric and body mass
   measurements. Data were collected from an equal number of male and
   female individuals sampled across seasons over a 7-year period
   (1999-2002, 2004-2006). Results indicate that adult body mass and
   morphometric measurements varied between sexes across sites; however,
   the only significant intersexual difference found was that females
   possessed, on average, longer tails than males. Contrary to previous
   studies, significant seasonal variation could not be detected in either
   male or female body mass or testicular volume (i.e., breeding vs.
   nonbreeding, food-scarce vs. food-abundant seasons). Measurements did,
   however, vary significantly by site and subspecies, though clinal
   variation could not explain these differences. The introduced population
   from Nosy Mangabe exhibited significantly lower body mass and overall
   body length than all other populations; however, this distinction may
   not have been attributable to natural variation, and may have instead
   resulted from the ecologically restrictive habitat (e.g., unusually high
   lemur population densities, limited food resources, ecological
   isolation) of this introduced population. Finally, although
   fore-to-hindlimb, brachium-to-thigh and hindlimb indices were comparable
   to previous values, forelimb indices calculated here deviate
   significantly from previous reports, placing V. variegata within the
   upper range of lemurid taxa. It is currently unknown whether this is an
   artifact of sampling methods (i.e., live vs. skeletal specimens) or
   whether this is an avenue that warrants further investigation.},

   comparison to substantiate the argument is one with other

   do not allow the conclusion that lemurs' BMR is lower than that of other
   strepsirrhines.},

Title = {Manual lateralization in early primates: A comparison of two mouse lemur

Abstract = {In humans, 90\% of the population is right handed. Although population
   hand preference has been found in some primate species, the evolution of
   manual lateralization in primates is not yet clear. To gain insight into
   manual lateralization of ancestral primates, we studied hand usage in
   unspecialized quadrupedal, nocturnal lemurs, using a large sample size.
   We compared two closely related mouse lemur species to explore the
   variation of hand preference within the same genus. We tested 44 gray
   mouse lemurs and 19 Goodman's mouse lemurs in a forced food grasping
   task. The tests were videotaped. Measures of hand preference (i.e. the
   hand that is spontaneously chosen for a specific task) and successful
   hand usage (i.e. the hand that is successful in completing a specific
   task) were taken to explore manual lateralization. Both species showed
   manual lateralization at an individual, but not at a population level.
   Goodman's mouse lemurs showed stronger individual hand preferences than
   gray mouse lemurs. This suggests that strength in hand preference is
   variable within the same genus. No sex and age effects were found. The
   hand preference of offspring was negatively correlated to that of their
   mothers, but not correlated to that of their fathers. Thus, no clear
   genetic effect can be derived from these results. In the Goodman's mouse
   lemurs, hand preference increased with increasing task experience.
   However, successful hand usage was not affected by task experience,
   suggesting that successful hand usage is a more stable measurement for
   manual lateralization than hand preference.},

Abstract = {Understanding the co-occurrence of ecologically similar species remains
   a puzzling issue in community ecology. The species-rich mouse lemurs
   (Microcebus spec.) are distributed over nearly all remaining forest
   areas of Madagascar with a high variability in species distribution
   patterns. Locally, many congeneric species pairs seem to co-occur, but
   only little detailed information on spatial patterns is available. Here,
   we present the results of an intensive capture-mark-recapture study of
   sympatric Microcebus berthae and M. murinus populations that revealed
   small-scale mutual spatial exclusion. Nearest neighbour analysis
   indicated a spatial aggregation in Microcebus murinus but not in M.
   berthae. Although the diet of both species differed in proportions of
   food categories, they used the same food sources and had high feeding
   niche overlap. Also, forest structure related to the spatial
   distribution of main food sources did not explain spatial segregation
   because parts used by each species exclusively did not differ in density
   of trees, dead wood and lianas. We propose that life history trade-offs
   that result in species aggregation and a relative increase in the
   strength of intra-specific over inter-specific competition best explain
   the observed pattern of co-occurrence of ecologically similar congeneric
   Microcebus species.},

Abstract = {Dealing effectively with space to find important resources in a natural
   environment is a fundamental ability necessary for survival. Evidence
   has already been provided that wild gray mouse lemurs revisit stationary
   feeding sites regularly. In this study, we explore to what extent two
   sympatric mouse lemur species, Microcebus murinus and M. ravelobensis,
   revisited artificial feeding sites during a period of food scarcity. As
   the tested populations are marked with individual transponders, we built
   up artificial feeding platforms equipped with a transponder reader at
   nine different locations where mouse lemurs had been previously caught.
   We baited them with a liquid reward and recorded the visitors' ID, the
   time and frequency of their visits, as well as all encounters that
   occurred on the platforms. Only mouse lemurs visited platforms and a
   total of sixteen individuals across both species were identified. Mouse
   lemurs visited a platform with a frequency of 2.02 (+/-0.95, range:
   1-3.4) times in a night and they revisited it on several consecutive
   nights following their first visit (percentage of revisits 90.6\% +/-
   11.7, range: 73.3-100\%). First visits on a platform occurred on average
   44min (+/-35; range: 13-131) after sunset. We identified encounters
   between mouse lemurs on platforms: all of them were agonistic and within
   a species. Within a dyad, chasers were significantly heavier than
   chasees (N = 7 dyads). Our design of platform experiments offers the
   advantage of observing wild individually known small primates in their
   natural environment and of setting up controlled experiments to gain
   insight into their sensory and cognitive abilities.},

Abstract = {Bioacoustical studies in nonhuman primates have shown that loud calls
   can be reliably used as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for discriminating
   cryptic taxa, for their monitoring in the field as well as for the
   reconstruction of their phylogeny. To date, it is unknown, whether loud
   calls can be used for these purposes in sportive lemurs, for which
   current genetic studies suggest the existence of at least 24 cryptic
   species. The aim of this study was to compare the structure of loud
   calls of populations of sportive lemurs to characterize informative
   acoustic traits for taxa discrimination and to establish a phylogenetic
   tree based on acoustic structure. We have based our study on
   Inter-River-Systems (IRSs) as operational taxonomic units. Samples were
   collected from nine different localities of four IRSs along a transect
   from northwestern to northern Madagascar. Two call types, the ouah and
   the high-pitched call, were present in almost all IRSs. Six temporal and
   eight spectral parameters were measured in 196 calls of the best quality
   given by 21 different males. Variation within and between IRSs was
   assessed by multivariate statistics. Loud calls differed significantly
   among the different IRSs. The IRSs varied most in spectral parameters,
   whereas temporal parameters were less variable. Phylogenetic analysis
   using parsimony yielded 11 out of 17 acoustic characters as
   phylogenetically informative. The acoustic tree had an average branch
   support of 78\%. Its topology coincided less with geographic distances
   than with genetic tree topology. Altogether our findings revealed that
   loud calls separated geographically isolated populations of sportive
   lemurs specifically. Based on these results, noninvasive tools for
   diagnosis and monitoring of cryptic species in nature can be developed
   for conservation management.},

Abstract = {Genetic differentiation between natural populations is best understood
   as a result of both natural and anthropogenic factors. Genetic studies
   on large populations still living under relatively undisturbed
   conditions are extremely valuable to disentangle these influences. The
   effect of three natural (geographic distance, landscape, dispersal)
   factors and two anthropogenic factors (road, savannah) on gene flow was
   analyzed in the largest remaining forest region in the range of the
   endangered golden-brown mouse lemur in Madagascar. A total of 187
   individuals from 12 sites were sampled and genotyped at eight
   polymorphic microsatellite loci. All sites exhibited similar levels of
   genetic variation. The level of genetic differentiation was low to
   moderate with pairwise F-ST values ranging from -0.002 to 0.12, but most
   were significant and all sites exhibited high self-assignment rates. A
   spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed at two geographic scales
   revealing a pattern of isolation-by-distance and suggesting that no
   clear differences exist between male and female local dispersal. Two
   Bayesian approaches revealed that a stretch of savannah represented a
   significant barrier to movement, whereas the influence of the road on
   gene flow was less clear. Finally, we found that landscape
   characteristics, in particular altitude, play a role in the functional
   connectivity of the sites. The study underlines the importance of
   studies in relatively undisturbed conditions for the interpretation of
   population genetics data in fragmented environments. The results are
   discussed in terms of their conservation relevance for forest-dwelling
   animals such as most primate species.},

Title = {Improved recruitment of a lemur-dispersed tree in Malagasy dry forests

Volume = {157},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine how the processes of seed
   dispersal and seed predation were altered in forest fragments of the dry
   forest of Madagascar, where the usual seed dispersers and vertebrate
   seed predators were absent, using a lemur-dispersed tree species
   (Strychnos madagascariensis; Loganiaceae) as an example. We then
   assessed how the changes in vertebrate community composition alter the
   regeneration pattern and establishment of this tree species and thus,
   ultimately, the species composition of the forest fragments. By using
   size-selective exclosures, data from forest fragments were compared with
   results from continuous forest where vertebrate dispersers and predators
   were abundant. Visits to the exclosures by mammalian seed predators were
   monitored with hair traps. In the continuous forest up to 100\% of the
   seeds were removed within the 7 days of the experiments. A substantial
   proportion of them was lost to seed predation by native rodents. In
   contrast, practically no predation took place in the forest fragments
   and almost all seeds removed were dispersed into the safety of ant nests
   by Aphaenogaster swammerdami, which improves chances of seedling
   establishment. In congruence with these findings, the abundance of S.
   madagascariensis in the forest fragments exceeded that of the continuous
   forest. Thus, the lack of vertebrate seed dispersers in these forest
   fragments did not lead to a decline in regeneration of this
   animal-dispersed tree species as would have been expected, but rather
   was counterbalanced by the concomitant demise of vertebrate seed
   predators and an increased activity of ants taking over the role of seed
   dispersers, and possibly even out-doing the original candidates. This
   study provides an example of a native vertebrate-dispersed species
   apparently profiting from fragmentation due to flexible animal-plant
   interactions in different facets, possibly resulting in an impoverished
   tree species community.},

Abstract = {Dimensions of the external midface in mammals are sometimes related to
   olfactory abilities (e.g., ``olfactory snouts{''} of strepsirrhine
   primates). This association hinges on the largely unexplored
   relationship between the protruding midface and internal topography of
   the nasal fossae. Herein, serially sectioned heads of embryonic to adult
   cheirogaleid primates (mouse and dwarf lemurs) and a comparative sample
   were studied. To assess the anteroposterior distribution of olfactory
   epithelium (OE) within the nasal fossa, the surface area of OE and
   non-OE was measured in two mouse lemurs (one adult, one infant).
   Prenatally, ethmoturbinal projections appear in an anteroposterior
   sequence. Fetal mouse lemurs, tenrecs, voles, and flying lemurs have
   four ethmoturbinals that project toward the nasal septum. Major
   distinctions among these mammals include the number of turbinals in
   recesses and the extent of the olfactory recess. Surface area
   measurements in the adult mouse lemur reveal that 31\% of the entire
   nasal fossa is lined with OE. The majority is sequestered in a posterior
   recess (70\% OF). Anterior to this space, only 28\% of the nasal fossa
   is lined with OE. Ethmoturbinal I is lined with relatively less OE
   (35\%) compared with more posterior ethmoturbinals (46-57\%). Age
   comparisons support the idea that OE increases less than non-OE between
   ages. Regionally, results suggest that most growth in surface area
   occurs in turbinals. But in all ethmoturbinals, surface area of non-OE
   differs between ages more than that of OE. This study shows that the
   anterior part of the nasal fossa is mostly nonolfactory in Microcebus
   murinus.},

Abstract = {In mating systems that involve competing males and choosy females, males
   are expected to advertise their genetic quality to discriminating
   females. Most examples have focused on visual or acoustic signals, such
   as ornamentation or song; yet arguably, olfactory communication may be
   more important to the majority of vertebrates with the possible
   exception of birds. Fortunately, attention has begun to shift to the
   role of odours in mate choice, with most of that attention being
   directed at the major histocompatibility complex or more recently at the
   major urinary proteins. The study of male ring-tailed lemurs presented
   by Charpentier and colleagues in this issue adds a new dimension to
   investigations of the influence of genes on mate choice via odour
   production. By comparing genetic heterozygosity to the production of
   semiochemicals in the scrotal scent gland, they provide a link between
   genetic composition and scent-marking behaviour as a potential
   advertisement of male quality.},

Abstract = {The social organization of gregarious lemurs significantly deviates from
   predictions of the socioecological model, as they form small groups in
   which the number of males approximately equals the number of females.
   This study uses models of reproductive skew theory as a new approach to
   explain this unusual group composition, in particular the high number of
   males, in a representative of these lemurs, the redfronted lemur
   (Eulemur fulvus rufus). We tested two central predictions of
   ``concession{''} models of reproductive skew theory, which assume that
   subordinates may be allowed limited reproduction by dominant group
   members as an incentive to remain in the group, thereby increasing the
   group's overall productivity. Accordingly, relatives are predicted to
   receive less reproduction than non-relatives, and the overall amount of
   reproductive concessions given to subordinates is predicted to increase
   as the number of subordinates increases. In addition, we tested whether
   the number of females in a group, a variable not previously incorporated
   in reproductive skew theory, affected reproductive skew among males.
   Using microsatellite analyses of tissue DNA, we determined paternities
   of 49 offspring born into our study population in Kirindy forest
   (western Madagascar) since 1996 to determine patterns of male
   reproductive skew to test these predictions. Our analyses revealed
   remarkable reproductive skew, with 71\% of all infants being sired by
   dominant males, but both predictions of reproductive skew models could
   not be supported. Instead, the number of females best predicted the
   apportionment of reproduction among the males in this species,
   suggesting that current reproductive skew models need to incorporate
   this factor to predict reproductive partitioning among male primates and
   perhaps other group-living mammals.},

Abstract = {The extent to which seasonal plasticity in torpor displayed by one of
   the smallest Malagasy primates (Microcebus murinus) will help survival
   in the context of ongoing global change-induced chronic food shortage,
   is unknown. Body temperature (Tb) and locomotor activity were measured
   by telemetry in short- (SD, winter-acclimated) and long-days (LD,
   summer-acclimated) males (n = 24) during an experimental 35-day calorie
   restriction of 40 or 80\%. Under SD exposure, regardless of calorie
   restriction intensity, mouse lemurs immediately increased torpor depth
   and duration by 4.6-fold, and showed greater phase-advanced entry into
   torpor (2.4-fold). Tb adjustments were efficient under 40\% calorie
   restriction to maintain body mass, whereas they did not prevent a 0.71
   +/- 0.11 g/day mass loss during 80\% calorie restriction. The 40\%
   food-deprived LD animals combined an early shallow deepening of torpor
   (1 degrees C) and a late 18\% decrease in locomotor activity, resulting
   in a moderate 6\% mass loss. After 15 days of 80\% calorie restriction,
   LD animals exhibited a SD phenotype by increasing their torpor duration
   and phase-advancing the entry of torpor (16 min/day). Those adjustments
   had no impact on mass loss (0.93 +/- 0.07 g/day) as locomotor activity
   increased four-fold. Daily torpor allows M. murinus to face moderate
   food shortage whatever the photoperiod but poorly mitigates energy
   imbalance during severe food deprivation, especially under LD exposure.
   Although the behavioral thermoregulation role warrants further
   investigation in energy savings, M. murinus survival would be impaired
   during long-term food shortage in summer.},

Title = {Flying lemurs - The `flying tree shrews'? Molecular cytogenetic evidence
   for a Scandentia-Dermoptera sister clade},
Journal = {BMC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Background: Flying lemurs or Colugos ( order Dermoptera) represent an
   ancient mammalian lineage that contains only two extant species.
   Although molecular evidence strongly supports that the orders
   Dermoptera, Scandentia, Lagomorpha, Rodentia and Primates form a
   superordinal clade called Supraprimates ( or Euarchontoglires), the
   phylogenetic placement of Dermoptera within Supraprimates remains
   ambiguous.
   Results: To search for cytogenetic signatures that could help to clarify
   the evolutionary affinities within this superordinal group, we have
   established a genome- wide comparative map between human and the Malayan
   flying lemur ( Galeopterus variegatus) by reciprocal chromosome painting
   using both human and G. variegatus chromosome-specific probes. The 22
   human autosomal paints and the X chromosome paint defined 44 homologous
   segments in the G. variegatus genome. A putative inversion on GVA 11 was
   revealed by the hybridization patterns of human chromosome probes 16 and
   19. Fifteen associations of human chromosome segments (HSA) were
   detected in the G. variegatus genome: HSA1/3, 1/10, 2/21, 3/21, 4/8,
   4/18, 7/15, 7/16, 7/19, 10/16, 12/22 ( twice), 14/15, 16/19 ( twice).
   Reverse painting of G. variegatus chromosome-specific paints onto human
   chromosomes confirmed the above results, and defined the origin of the
   homologous human chromosomal segments in these associations. In total,
   G. variegatus paints revealed 49 homologous chromosomal segments in the
   HSA genome.
   Conclusion: Comparative analysis of our map with published maps from
   representative species of other placental orders, including Scandentia,
   Primates, Lagomorpha and Rodentia, suggests a signature rearrangement
   (HSA2q/21 association) that links Scandentia and Dermoptera to one
   sister clade. Our results thus provide new evidence for the hypothesis
   that Scandentia and Dermoptera have a closer phylogenetic relationship
   to each other than either of them has to Primates.},

Abstract = {The exceptional biodiversity of Madagascar is threatened by
   anthropogenic landscape changes that took place during the 2000 years of
   human colonization. This study focuses on the influence of geographic
   distance and forest fragmentation on genetic diversity and population
   differentiation of three rare, nocturnal, arboreal lemur species in
   northwestern Madagascar. Historic declines in population sizes as a
   consequence of forest fragmentation are quantified and dated. Eighteen
   sites were visited, and a total of 205 Microcebus ravelobensis, 45 M.
   bongolavensis and 78 M. danfossi were genotyped with eight
   microsatellite loci. Genetic differentiation among the sites, as
   measured by F-ST ranged from 0.01 to 0.19. These values were significant
   in almost all cases and indicated genetic structure in the samples.
   Isolation-by-distance was detected in one species and a STRUCTURE
   analysis indicated that fragmentation further promoted genetic
   differentiation. Bayesian methods revealed that populations from all
   three species underwent a major demographic collapse of around two
   orders of magnitude. This decrease probably began after the arrival of
   humans, most likely within the last 500 years. This result suggests that
   anthropogenic changes may have been limited during the first 1500 years
   of human colonization in all three ranges. Two of the study species (M.
   dunfossi, M. bongolavensis) lack effectively protected areas in their
   ranges. Consequently, quick conservation actions are now needed in order
   to secure the remaining genetic diversity of these species. (C) 2008

Volume = {122},

Abstract = {Olfactory cues of predators, such as feces, are known to elicit
   antipredator responses in animals (e.g., avoidance, activity). To date,
   however, there is little information on olfactory predator recognition
   in primates. We tested whether the odor of feces of different predator
   categories (historical Malagasy predators and introduced predators) and
   of Malagasy nonpredators (control) induces antipredator behavior in
   captive born, predator-naive gray mouse lemurs. In an olfactory predator
   experiment a mouse lemur was exposed to a particular odor, fixed at a
   preferred location, where the animal was trained to get a reward. The
   behavior of the mouse lemur toward the respective stimulus category was
   videotaped and quantified. Results showed that mouse lemurs avoided the
   place of odor presentation when the odor belonged to a predator. They
   reacted with a significantly enhanced activity when exposed to odors of
   carnivores compared to those of nonpredatory controls. These findings
   are in favor of a genetic predisposition of olfactory predator
   recognition that might be based on the perception of metabolites from
   meat digestion.},

Title = {DNA from extinct giant lemurs links archaeolemurids to extant indriids},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {Background: Although today 15\% of living primates are endemic to
   Madagascar, their diversity was even greater in the recent past since
   dozens of extinct species have been recovered from Holocene excavation
   sites. Among them were the so-called ``giant lemurs{''} some of which
   weighed up to 160 kg. Although extensively studied, the phylogenetic
   relationships between extinct and extant lemurs are still difficult to
   decipher, mainly due to morphological specializations that reflect
   ecology more than phylogeny, resulting in rampant homoplasy.
   Results: Ancient DNA recovered from subfossils recently supported a
   sister relationship between giant ``sloth{''} lemurs and extant indriids
   and helped to revise the phylogenetic position of Megaladapis edwardsi
   among lemuriformes, but several taxa-such as the Archaeolemuridae -
   still await analysis. We therefore used ancient DNA technology to
   address the phylogenetic status of the two archaeolemurid genera
   (Archaeolemur and Hadropithecus). Despite poor DNA preservation
   conditions in subtropical environments, we managed to recover 94- to
   539-bp sequences for two mitochondrial genes among 5 subfossil samples.
   Conclusion: This new sequence information provides evidence for the
   proximity of Archaeolemur and Hadropithecus to extant indriids, in
   agreement with earlier assessments of their taxonomic status (Primates,
   Indrioidea) and in contrast to recent suggestions of a closer
   relationship to the Lemuridae made on the basis of analyses of dental
   developmental and postcranial characters. These data provide new
   insights into the evolution of the locomotor apparatus among lemurids
   and indriids.},

Abstract = {The extravagance and diversity of external genitalia have been well
   characterized in male primates; however, much less is known about sex
   differences or variation in female form. Our study represents a
   departure from traditional investigations of primate reproductive
   anatomy because we 1) focus on external rather than internal genitalia,
   2) measure both male and female structures, and 3) examine a
   strepsirrhine rather than an anthropoid primate. The subjects for
   morphological study were 21 reproductively intact, adult ring-tailed
   lemurs (Lemur catta), including 10 females and 11 males, two of which
   (one per sex) subsequently died of natural causes and also served as
   specimens for gross anatomical dissection. Male external genitalia
   presented a typical masculine configuration, with a complex distal
   penile morphology. In contrast, females were unusual among mammals,
   presenting an enlarged, pendulous external clitoris, tunneled by the
   urethra. Females had a shorter anogenital distance and a larger urethral
   meatus than did males, but organ diameter and circumference showed no
   sex differences. Dissection confirmed these characterizations.
   Noteworthy in the male were the presence of a ``levator penis{''} muscle
   and discontinuity in the corpus spongiosurn along the penile shaft;
   noteworthy in the female were an elongated clitoral shaft and glans
   clitoridis. The female urethra, while incorporated within the clitoral
   body, was not surrounded by erectile tissue, as we detected no corpus
   spongiosum. The os clitoridis was 43\% the length and 24\% the height of
   the os penis. On the basis of these first detailed descriptions of
   strepsirrhine external genitalia (for either sex), we characterize those
   of the female ring-tailed lemur as moderately ``masculinized.{''} Our
   results highlight certain morphological similarities and differences
   between ring-tailed lemurs and the most male-like of female mammals, the
   spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), and call attention to a potential
   hormonal mechanism of ``masculinization{''} in female lemur development.},

   lemur},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {70},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Predator mobbing is a widespread phenomenon in many taxa but the
   evolution of cooperative mobbing as an adaptive behavior is still
   subject to debate. Here, we report evidence for cooperative predator
   defense in a nocturnal solitarily foraging primate, the gray mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus). Several mouse lemurs mobbed a snake that held a
   non-related male conspecific until he could escape. Evolutionary
   hypotheses to explain cooperative mobbing include (1) by-product
   mutualism, when individuals defend others in the process of defending
   themselves; (2) reciprocity, where animals achieve a higher fitness when
   helping each other than when they do not cooperate; and (3) kin
   selection where animals help each other only if they share genes by
   common descent. Owing to the solitary activity of this species,
   reciprocity seems to be least likely to explain our observations.
   By-product mutualism cannot be ruled out entirely but, if costs of snake
   mobbing are relatively low, the available detailed socio-genetic
   information indicates that kin selection, rather than any of the other
   proposed mechanisms, is the primary evolutionary force behind the
   observed cooperative rescue.},

Title = {The lemur syndrome unresolved: extreme male reproductive skew in sifakas
   (Propithecus verreauxi), a sexually monomorphic primate with female
   dominance},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {62},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The primates of Madagascar (Lemuriformes) are unusual among mammals in
   that polygynous species lack sexual dimorphism, and females dominate
   males socially in most species. Moreover, lemur groups are relatively
   small and characterized by even adult sex ratios despite the fact that
   one male should be able to exclude other males from the group. One
   hypothesis to explain this combination of behavioral, morphological, and
   demographic traits (the ``lemur syndrome{''}) postulates that male-male
   competition is relaxed and, hence, variance in male reproductive success
   is low. Reproductive skew theory provides a framework for testing this
   and several related predictions about lemur social evolution.
   Specifically, low reproductive skew is also predicted if dominant males
   or adult females make reproductive concessions to subordinates or if the
   latter group successfully pursues alternative reproductive tactics.
   However, suitable data on paternity, demography, and behavior for a
   conclusive test of these predictions have not been available in the
   past. In this paper, we show that male reproductive success in ten
   groups of Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) was extremely
   skewed in favor of the dominant male over 9 years. Our genetic analyses
   also revealed that more than a third of all groups are effectively harem
   groups because only one male was unrelated to the resident female(s). In
   groups with two or more non-natal males, the dominant sired 91\% of 33
   infants. Together, males pursuing one of several alternative
   reproductive tactics, such as roaming among several groups or
   immigrating peacefully, sired only 11\% of infants. Thus, female sifakas
   do not control group composition by offering reproductive opportunities
   to subordinate males as staying incentives, intrasexual selection is not
   relaxed, and dominant males prevail in a tug-of-war over subordinate
   males. Because male reproductive skew in sifakas is even more pronounced
   than in harem-living anthropoids studied to date, intrasexual selection
   is clearly not relaxed, and the lemur syndrome is more puzzling than
   ever.},

Title = {Androgen and glucocorticoid levels reflect seasonally occurring social
   challenges in male redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus)},

Abstract = {Intense reproductive competition and social instability are assumed to
   increase concentrations of glucocorticoids and androgens in vertebrates,
   as a means of coping with these challenges. In seasonally breeding
   redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus), the mating and the birth
   season and the associated increased male competition are predicted to
   pose such reproductive challenges. In this paper, we investigate
   seasonal variation in hormone excretion in male redfronted lemurs, and
   examine whether this variation is associated with social or ecological
   factors. Although dominance status has been shown to affect individual
   stress levels across many taxa, we predicted no rank-related differences
   in glucocorticoids for redfronted lemurs because relatively equal costs
   are associated with both high and low rank positions (based on patterns
   of rank acquisition/maintenance and threats toward subordinates). Over a
   14-month period, we collected behavioral data (1843 focal hours) and 617
   fecal samples from 13 redfronted lemur males in Kirindy
   Forest/Madagascar. We found no general rank-related pattern of
   testosterone or glucocorticoid excretion in this species. Both hormones
   were excreted at significantly higher levels during the mating and the
   birth season, despite social stability during both periods. The elevated
   mating season levels may be explained by increased within-group
   reproductive competition during this time and are in line with previous
   studies of other seasonally reproducing primates. For the birth season
   increase, we propose that the predictable risk of infanticide in this
   highly seasonal species affects male gonadal and adrenal endocrine
   activity. We evaluate alternative social and ecological factors
   influencing the production of both hormone classes and conclude based on
   our preliminary investigations that none of them can account for the
   observed pattern.},

Abstract = {The scope of data now available for primates from long-term field and
   captive studies has opened up exciting possibilities for investigating
   age-related patterns of reproduction. Valuable information on the aging
   process can be gleaned through broad cross-taxonomic comparative studies
   that include lemurs, monkeys, apes and humans. Thus, across all taxa
   discussed in this volume, female reproduction was found to be complex
   and dynamic, affected by the interplay of multiple exogenous and
   endogenous factors. Throughout their lives, females differ in their
   individual reproductive output. As they age, a period of reproductive
   instability is common among female primates and perimenopausal-like
   hormonal changes have been noted in many species. Available data from
   lemurs and callitrichids indicate that at least in some species,
   age-related declines in reproduction are manifested as diminished
   success of females to rear their young to weaning age. Few data are
   available for New World primates, but the same observation holds true
   for Old World monkey females, who also are characterized by declines in
   sexual activity and decreased birth rates. In apes, captive data suggest
   the presence of an appreciable postreproductive lifespan but this has
   not been confirmed in the wild. Menopause may be manifested as an
   evolutionary continuum across primate taxa with the potential for an
   extended postreproductive lifespan evident in cercopithecines and apes.

Volume = {79},
Number = {2},
Pages = {55-78},
Abstract = {While understanding somatic variability among wild primates can provide
   insight into natural patterns of developmental plasticity, published
   data for living populations are rare. Here we provide such information
   for two distinct wild populations of Lemur catta. Variants observed
   include microtia, athelia, and female virilization. Dental variants
   observed include individuals with supernumerary teeth, rotated teeth,
   maxillary incisor agenesis, and severe malocclusion. There was a sex
   bias in incisor agenesis, with 5 of 7 examples (71\%) found in males.
   The frequency of dental variants in our sample is lower than that seen
   in many other lemuriformes, as well as other primates. This may be a
   product of their less derived dental formula and/or their relatively
   fast dental development. Amassing such data is a critical first step to
   assess if wild primate populations are exhibiting normal variability or
   are being affected by potential inbreeding and/or environmental effects.

Abstract = {Both human and nonhuman primates preferentially orient toward other
   individuals and follow gaze in controlled environments. Precisely where
   any animal looks during natural behavior, however, remains unknown. We
   used a novel telemetric gaze-tracking system to record orienting
   behavior of ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta) interacting with a
   naturalistic environment. We here provide the first evidence that
   ringtailed lemurs, group-living prosimian primates, preferentially gaze
   towards other individuals and, moreover, follow other lemurs' gaze while
   freely moving and interacting in naturalistic social and ecological
   environments. Our results support the hypothesis that stem primates were
   capable of orienting toward and following the attention of other
   individuals. Such abilities may have enabled the evolution of more
   complex social behavior and cognition, including theory of mind and
   language, which require spontaneous attention sharing. This is the first
   study to use telemetric eye-tracking to quantitatively monitor gaze in
   any nonhuman animal during locomotion, feeding, and social interaction.
   Moreover, this is the first demonstration of gaze following by a
   prosimian primate and the first to report gaze following during
   spontaneous interaction in naturalistic social environments.},

Abstract = {Understanding the way prosimian primates age can be helpful in inferring
   what the `basal primate mode' of senescence may have been. Even though
   prosimians are known to be long-lived in captivity, relatively little is
   known about their reproductive senescence, and even less is known about
   how prosimians age in their natural habitats. Twenty years of
   observational data in Madagascar for four Propithecus edwordsi sifaka
   groups were used to analyze reproductive and behavioral trends of aging
   in the wild. Techniques using tooth wear were developed to establish
   ages of wild sifakas and to estimate the onset of their `dental
   senescence', a proxy for the onset of decline in the ability to obtain
   nutrition. Estimated maximum longevity was 32 years for female sifakas.
   Based on the loss of dental functional morphology, and changes in tooth
   wear patterns and in chewing efficiency, dental senescence was estimated
   to set in at approximately 18 years of age. Of the adult females in the
   study groups, the yearly average of the number of dentally senescent
   females was 24\%. There was no indication of a decline in fertility in
   the dentally senescent females (aged > 18 years) compared to younger
   adult females (aged 4-18 years). The field data showed, however, that in
   years when rain was decreased during months of prime lactation, infants
   of dentally senescent mothers died before weaning. This may be because
   the nursing mother's worn teeth could not shear leaves and extract
   moisture, nor nutrition, both essential for successful lactation. Old
   females showed no clear signs of social disengagement, further
   suggesting that drought-induced stress plays a direct role in increased
   infant mortality. These data support earlier findings that prosimian
   females continue to cycle and give birth until death. The effect of
   environmental variation on infant survival, however, indicates an
   incipient age-linked decline in reproductive fitness. Therefore, whereas
   lemurs represent the condition of no menopause, changes in infant
   survival may uncover selective factors that have in part led to the
   evolution of menopause in other primates. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger

Abstract = {Only a preliminary qualitative description of the vocal repertoire of
   Eulemur coronatus is available and no quantitative study of the calls of
   any wild or captive crowned lemur has ever been performed. The aim of
   this study was to verify whether the categories of calls in the crowned
   lemur's vocal repertoire briefly described on qualitatively bases by
   MACEDONIA \& STANGER (1994) correspond to discrete phonetic categories.
   Through all-occurrence and focal animal observations, we recorded the
   vocal activity of 37 crowned lemurs housed in five institutions, both in
   Europe and Madagascar. We measured both temporal and spectral properties
   to describe calls quantitatively. We extracted acoustic parameters in
   the perspective of the source-filter theory of sound production. From
   spectrograms, we measured call duration and 6 larynx-related features
   and, using Linear Predictive Coding spectra, we measured four vocal
   tract related acoustic properties. From a preliminary qualitative
   inspection of the spectrograms, we identified the 12 types of
   vocalizations previously described by MACEDONIA \& STANGER (1994) and
   partially by PETTER \& CHARLES-DOMINIOUE (1979). Our quantitative
   analysis has statistical support for a clear classification of 10
   acoustic types: Long Grunt, Long Grunt Clear Call, Grunted Hoot, Grunt,
   Snort, Click, Hoot, Alarm Call, Tonal Call and Scream. In particular,
   cross-validated Discriminant Function Analysis successfully classified a
   high percentage of the vocal signals in the 10 vocal categories.
   Acoustic cues of both larynx-related and vocal tract-related acoustic
   parameters also offered preliminary support for both sex and individual
   identity potential that should be more thoroughly investigated in future
   studies.},

Abstract = {Adaptation of physiological and behavioral functions to seasonal changes
   in daylength is of major relevance for optimal fitness and survival.
   Because aging is characterized by changes in biological rhythms, it may
   be hypothesized that old animals fall short of showing a full adaptation
   to prolonged changes in the duration of daily light exposure, as
   naturally occurring in relation to season in younger individuals. To
   test this hypothesis, we analyzed changes in the patterns of daily
   locomotor activity and body temperature rhythms of young and old mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus murinus, Primates) exposed to short and long
   daylengths. The effect of an increase in the duration of daily light
   exposure was attenuated in old animals, as compared to younger lemurs.
   Although some age-related differences in the locomotor activity rhythm
   could be seen under exposure to short daylength, they were predominant
   under long daylength. Some mechanisms allowing adaptation to changing
   daylength thus seem to be impaired at old age. Changes in coupling of
   circadian oscillators to the light-dark cycle and disturbances in the
   physiological responses to change in light duration should be further
   investigated. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The presence of context-specific communication sounds, structurally
   different call types related to particular situations and potentially
   expressing distinct emotions of the caller were not systematically
   studied in infants of strepsirrhine primates. We exposed suckling's of
   gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) in an infant separation paradigm
   to three distinct contexts (isolation, threat-induced, grooming). An
   audio-videographic analysis of sound-correlated infant behaviors and a
   simultaneous multiparametric sound analysis revealed context-specific
   calls. Peak frequency predicted their acoustic classification best.
   Findings provided first evidence for a strepsirrhine primate that infant
   communication sounds may express distinct contexts and thereby infant's
   need reliably. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the Lemur leaf frog
   Hylomantis lemur Boulenger, 1882. Dermaseptin-L1
   (GLWSKIKEAAKAAGKAALNAVTGLVNQGDQPS) was active against the Gram-negative
   bacterium Escherichia coli (MIC = 8 mu M) but inactive against the
   Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. This peptide inhibited
   growth of zoospores of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis
   at concentrations above 25 mu M but did not completely inhibit growth at
   100 mu M. Phylloseptin-L1 (LLGMIPLAISAISALSKL.NH2) was active against S.
   aureus (MIC = 8 mu M) but was inactive against E coli. This peptide also
   inhibited growth of R dendrobatidis zoospores at concentrations above 25
   mu M with complete inhibition at 100 mu M. Dermaseptin-L1 showed
   selective cytolytic activity against HepG2 human hepatoma-derived cells
   (LC50 = 45 mu M) compared with human erythrocytes (LC50 = 200 M) whereas
   phylloseptin-L1 was approximately equipotent against both HepG2 cells

Abstract = {Several species of Malagasy prosimians are characterized by female
   dominance, an unusual trait among mammals. We compare the extent to
   which female dominance is displayed and the mechanisms that are used to
   maintain dominance in the frugivorous blue-eyed black lemurs (Eulemur
   macaco flavifrons) and the folivorous gray bamboo lemurs (Hapalemur
   griseus griseus) housed at the Duke Lemur Center. All
   dominant-submissive interactions were recorded during 448 hr of focal
   animal observations. Both species of lemurs exhibited clear patterns of
   female dominance. However, the two species used aggressive dominance
   (defined as aggression+submission) and social dominance (defined as
   submission in the absence of aggression) to different extents in
   maintaining hierarchies within each group. The adult female blue-eyed
   black lemurs used aggressive dominance (e.g., chase, cuff, bite) in more
   of their dominance interactions (66\%) than did the adult female gray
   bamboo lemurs (40\%). In both species, rates of aggressive dominance
   interactions were higher during feeding versus nonfeeding periods and
   while in smaller outdoor runs versus larger natural habitat enclosures,
   but the differences were not significant. Overall blue-eyed black lemurs
   exhibit a more aggressive form of female dominance compared to the gray
   bamboo lemur.},

Abstract = {Microcebus ravelobensis is an endangered nocturnal primate endemic to
   northwestern Madagascar. This part of the island is subject to extensive
   human intervention leading to massive habitat destruction and
   fragmentation. We investigated the degree of genetic differentiation
   among remaining populations using mitochondrial control region sequences
   (479-482 bases). Nine populations were sampled from the hypothesized
   geographic range. The region is composed of three inter-river systems
   (IRSs). Samples were collected in three areas of continuous forests
   (CFs) and six isolated forest fragments (IFFs) of different sizes. We
   identified 27 haplotypes in 114 animals, with CFs and IFFs harbouring
   5-6 and 1-3 haplotypes, respectively. All IFFs were significantly
   differentiated from each other with high Phi(ST) values and sets of
   unique haplotypes. The rivers constitute significant dispersal barriers
   with over 82\% of the molecular variation being attributed to the
   divergence among the IRSs. The data suggest a deep and so far unknown
   split within the rufous mouse lemurs of northwestern Madagascar. The
   limited data base and the lack of ecological and morphological data do
   not allow definite taxonomic classification at this stage. However, the
   results clearly indicate that M. ravelobensis consists of three
   evolutionary significant units, possibly cryptic species, which warrant
   urgent and separate conservation efforts.},

Title = {Body mass distribution and gait mechanics in fat-tailed dwarf lemurs

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {53},

Abstract = {Most quadrupeds walk with lateral sequence (LS) gaits, where hind limb
   touchdowns are followed by ipsilateral forelimb touchdowns. Primates,
   however, typically walk with diagonal sequence (DS) gairs, where hind
   limb touchdowns are followed by contralateral forelimb touchdowns.
   Because the use of DS gaits is nearly ubiquitous among primates,
   understanding gait selection in primates is critical to understanding
   primate locomotor evolution. The Support Polygon Model {[}Tomita, M.,
   1967. A study on the movement pattern of four limbs in walking. J.
   Anthropol. Soc. Nippon 75, 120-146; Rollinson, J., Martin, R.D., 1981.
   Comparative aspects of primate locomotion, with special reference to
   arboreal cereopithecines. Symp. Zool. Soc. Lond. 48, 377-427] argues
   that primates' use of DS gaits stems from a more caudal position of the
   whole-body center of mass (COM) relative to other mammals. We tested the
   predictions of the Support Polygon Model by examining the effects of
   natural and experimental variations in COM position on gait mechanics in
   two distantly related primates: fat-tailed dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus
   medius) and patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas). Dwarf lemur experiments
   compared individuals with and without a greatly enlarged tail (a feature
   associated with torpor that can be expected to shift the COM caudally).
   During patas monkey experiments, we experimentally shifted the COM
   cranially with the use of a weighted belt (7-12\% of body mass)
   positioned above the scapulae. Examination of limb kinematics revealed
   changes consistent with systematic deviations in COM position.
   Nevertheless, footfall patterns changed in a direction contrary to the
   predictions of the Support Polygon Model in the dwarf lemurs and did not
   change at all in the patas monkey. These results suggest that body mass
   distribution is unlikely to be the sole determinant of footfall pattern
   in primates and other mammals. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The apocrine and sebaceous scent glands of ringtailed lemurs (Lemur
   catta) appear to serve different social functions. In behavioral
   experiments, lemurs modulate their responses to scent marks based on the
   type of odorant, their own physiological state, the signaler's
   physiological state, and prior social experience. To examine variation
   in odorant chemistry relative to olfactory behavior, we used gas
   chromatography and mass spectrometry to analyze over 86 samples of
   glandular secretion collected over 2 years from 15 adult lemurs. Labial
   and scrotal secretions contained organic acids and esters, whereas male
   brachial secretions were composed almost entirely of squalene and
   cholesterol derivatives. Principal component and linear discriminant
   analyses revealed glandular, individual-specific, and seasonal variation
   in chemical profiles but no relationship to the signaler's social
   status. The chemical composition of the various secretions provides
   further clues about the function of the different glands: the higher
   molecular weight compounds in genital and brachial secretions may
   increase signal longevity and provide lasting information to
   conspecifics, consistent with a role in advertising resource ownership
   or reproductive state. Conversely, the lower molecular weight compounds
   of antebrachial secretions produce ephemeral signals used primarily in
   social dominance displays and require integration of multiple sensory
   modalities for effective signal transmission.},

Abstract = {Male mating tactics can vary according to the potential for scramble or
   contest competition but also as a consequence of individual
   characteristics, such as body condition and previous experience. The
   influence of experience, i.e., residency, on male recapture rates and
   reproductive success was studied in a population of free-living grey
   mouse lemurs. Long-term capture data from 320 individuals revealed that
   both sexes had very low recapture probabilities within their first year
   in the study population, but recapture rates declined less sharply
   during the following years. Capture results and telemetric analyses on
   12 focal males revealed that resident males had larger body mass and
   larger home ranges than new males. Home range size correlated with the
   number of accessible females, indicating that resident males had higher
   probabilities to meet mates than new males. The reproductive success of
   132 candidate fathers, representing both resident and new males, was
   determined by means of molecular genotyping. Paternity determination was
   successful in 38 cases (success rate: 19\%). Sixteen resident males and
   seventeen new males sired offspring. However, in relation to the number
   of candidate fathers being present in the mating season, resident males
   were twice as likely to reproduce successfully as new males. These
   findings suggest experience-dependent reproductive tactics that most
   likely correspond to a differential spatial knowledge of resources,
   mates and potential threats. The results generally agree with the
   predictions made for a scramble competition regime and demonstrate
   substantial behavioral plasticity in a nocturnal primate species with a
   dispersed multi-male/ multi-female mating system.},

Abstract = {Mating system and dispersal patterns influence the spatio-genetic
   structure within and between populations. Among mammals, monogamy is
   rare, and its socio-genetic consequences have not been studied in detail
   before. The goal of our study was to investigate population history,
   demographic structure, and dispersal patterns in a population of
   pair-living fat-tailed dwarf lemurs, Cheirogaleus medius, a small,
   nocturnal primate from western Madagascar, and to infer their underlying
   behavioral mechanisms. Tissue samples for DNA extraction were obtained
   from a total of 140 individuals that were captured in two subpopulations
   about 3 km apart. Analyses of mtDNA variability at the population level
   revealed very low levels of genetic variability combined with high
   haplotype diversity, which is indicative of a recent population
   bottleneck. We found no evidence for spatial clustering of same-sexed
   individuals with identical haplotypes within each of two subpopulations
   but significant clustering between them. Thus, a high level of local
   subpopulation differentiation was observed (F-ST = 0.230). The sexes
   showed equal variances in the number of individuals representing each
   haplotype, as well as equal levels of aggregation of identical
   haplotypes. Hence, both sexes disperse from their natal area, one
   pattern expected in a pair-living mammal. There is a possibility of
   behavioral and social flexibility in this species, however, because we
   documented pronounced differences in density and sex ratio between the
   two subpopulations, suggesting that single study sites or populations
   may not be representative of a given local population or even species.},

Abstract = {The decline of cognitive capacities with age in mouse lemur primates
   (Microcebus murinus) was assessed. Eight young adults (2-4 years) and
   nine aged adults (7-11 years) were examined on tasks designed to measure
   executive functions, procedural and declarative memory. The mouse lemurs
   were tested on the go-no go successive discrimination task, set shifting
   tasks (including extra-dimensional shift and reversal discrimination)
   and a spatial rule-guided discrimination task. There were four major
   findings. First, the deficits observed were not global but only on
   specific tasks indicating that only specific cognitive abilities are
   impaired with aging. Second, there were variations among aged subjects
   suggesting different patterns of cognitive aging. Third, alterations in
   cognitive abilities with aging in mouse lemurs seemed to be comparable
   to those described in aged monkeys and humans. Indeed, executive
   functions and declarative memory were affected in subpopulations of aged
   subjects whereas procedural memory remained intact in all the tested
   aged subjects. Finally, two forms of executive dysfunctions were
   distinguished among the aged subjects. The ultimate goal is to correlate
   age-related cognitive deficit with brain alterations and this study has
   helped to select candidate regions to be thoroughly scrutinized in aged
   mouse lemurs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Sensory ecology of prey rustling sounds: acoustical features and their

Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {143-153},

Abstract = {1. Predatory mammals and birds from several phylogenetic lineages use
   prey rustling sounds to detect and locate prey. However, it is not known
   whether these rustling sounds convey information about the prey, such as
   its size or profitability, and whether predators use them to classify
   prey accordingly.
   2. We recorded rustling sounds of insects in Madagascar walking on
   natural substrate and show a clear correlation between insect mass and
   several acoustic parameters.
   3. In subsequent behavioural experiments in the field, we determined
   whether nocturnal animals, when foraging for insects, evaluate these
   parameters to classify their prey. We used field-experienced Grey Mouse
   Lemurs Microcebus murinus in short-term captivity. Mouse Lemurs are
   generally regarded as a good model for the most ancestral primate
   condition. They use multimodal sensorial information to find food
   (mainly fruit, gum, insect secretions and arthropods) in nightly forest.
   Acoustic cues play a role in detection of insect prey.
   4. When presented with two simultaneous playbacks of rustling sounds,
   lemurs spontaneously chose the one higher above their hearing threshold,
   i.e. they used the rustling sound's amplitude for classification. We
   were not able, despite attempts in a reinforced paradigm, to persuade
   lemurs to use cues other than amplitude, e.g. frequency cues, for prey
   discrimination.
   5. Our data suggests that Mouse Lemurs, when foraging for insects, use
   the mass-amplitude correlation of prey-generated rustling sounds to
   evaluate the average mass of insects and to guide their foraging
   decisions.},

Abstract = {Lemurs on St. Catherines Island, Georgia were tested for Trypanosoma
   cruzi infection to develop a better understanding of the epizootiology
   of the parasite in nonhuman primates in the southeastern United States.
   Fifty-six ring-tailed (Lemur catta), blue-eyed black (Eulemar macaco
   flavifrons), and black-and-white ruffed (Varecia variegata variegata)
   lemurs were tested by hemoculture and serology to determine the
   prevalence of T. cruzi in the population. Of those tested 3 (5\%) were
   identified as culture positive and 25 (44.6\%) as seropositive. When
   hemoculture results were compared with those from a similar study
   performed in 1997, prevalence remained unchanged. Genetic
   characterization of the 3 culture isolates indicated they belong to the
   T. cruzi IIa group, which is identical to strains previously isolated
   from raccoons on the island. Despite the occurrence of T. cruzi in the
   population, there was no evidence that the health of the lemurs was
   compromised as a result of infection. Based upon prevalence and
   available breeding records we speculate that both vertical and
   vector-mediated transmission play significant roles in the epidemiology
   of T. cruzi on the island. This also represents the first report of
   autochthonous infection in blue-eyed black and black-and-white ruffed

Journal = {REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {62},

Abstract = {Energy management triggers many life history traits. Due to sex-specific
   differences in reproductive investment, spatio-temporal distribution of
   food has been suggested to influence social organization and mating
   systems. Within primates, this hypothesis has rarely been tested in
   Malagasy lemurs. This study reviews the relationships between energy
   saving strategies and social systems in the nocturnal mouse lemur
   Microcebus murinus. Comparing data from field and captive studies, I
   propose an integrative hypothesis of energy-dependent plasticity in
   mouse lemur social systems. Short photoperiod-induced fattening is
   observed in captive animals of both sexes. In contrast, fattening
   observed in the field in the early dry season occurs in most females but
   only in some rare males. Fat reserves are used during periods of
   decreased activity, food shortage, and torpor bouts have been
   interpreted as facultative hibernation. I suggest that most males are
   excluded from female population nuclei and/or local resources,
   explaining male dispersal during the dry season, and the lack of
   fattening observed in most wild males. The model of Local Resource
   Enhancement may explain the bias in natal sex ratio observed in
   captivity, according to the size of female groups. The spatial
   distribution and abundance of resource trees fits with the size of
   matrilines revealed by sleeping associations. Young erratic males flock
   into female population nuclei in the late dry season, taking advantage
   of female inactivity. Therefore, seasonal fattening may be used by
   females to prepare for hibernation and by males to prepare for mating.
   Light males seem to use an opportunistic mating tactic resulting in
   scramble promiscuity. In captivity and probably in a few resident males,
   fat reserves may allow mate guarding and dominance resulting in
   polygyny. M. murinus appears particularly plastic in response to both
   seasonal and unpredictable changes in food availability, controlling
   group size, operational sex ratio, population dynamics and alternative
   mating tactics.},

Abstract = {Teeth grow incrementally and preserve within them a record of that
   incremental growth in the form of microscopic growth lines. Studying
   dental development in extinct and extant primates and its relationship
   to life history and ecological parameters ( e. g., diet, somatic growth
   rates, gestation length, age at weaning) holds the potential to yield
   unparalleled insights into the life history profiles of fossil primates.
   In this paper, we use the incremental growth record preserved in teeth
   to reconstruct dental development, and thereby infer the life history of
   Megaladapis edwardsi, a giant, gorilla-sized, extinct lemur of
   Madagascar. By examining the microstructure of the first and developing
   second molars of a juvenile individual, we establish its chronology of
   molar crown development (M-1 CFT=1.04 years; M-2 CFT=1.42 years) and
   determine its age at death (1.39 years). Crown initiation, formation,
   and completion times are short compared to Gorilla. Microstructural data
   on prenatal M-1 crown formation time allow us to calculate a minimum
   gestation length of 0.54 years for M. edwardsi, compared to 0.70 years
   in Gorilla. Postnatal crown and root formation in M. edwardsi data allow
   us to estimate the age at M-1 emergence (similar to 0.9 years), and to
   establish a minimum age for M-2 emergence (> 1.39 years). If Megaladapis
   were developmentally similar to large-bodied anthropoids (such as
   gorillas), we might expect it to exhibit slow dental development coupled
   with relatively early replacement of its deciduous molars. This is not
   the case. Total molar development is comparatively rapid and poorly
   explained as a function of adult body mass.},

Abstract = {Explanations for the chemosensory abilities of newborn mammals focus
   primarily on food (milk) acquisition and communication (e.g.,
   maternal-infant bonding). However, the relative importance of the main
   and accessory (vomeronasal) olfactory systems is hypothesized to differ
   at birth between altricial. and precocial mammals. Strepsirrhines
   (lemurs and lorises) possess main and accessory olfactory systems, and
   vary in life-history traits related to infant dependency and maturation.
   Accordingly, this study examines the size and maturational
   characteristics of vomeronasal (VNNE) and olfactory (OE) neuroepithelia
   in strepsirrhines. Serially sectioned heads of 18 infant cadavers were
   examined microscopically for neuroepithelial distribution. Measurements
   were taken on the length of the nasal fossa on one side that was
   occupied by VNNE and OE. The data were corrected for body size using the
   cranial length or body mass, and were then examined for correlation with
   several life-history variables, as well as activity pattern. In
   addition, immunohistochemistry was used to identify cells in the VNNE
   and OE that express olfactory marker protein (OMP), a marker of mature
   olfactory neurons. Relative OE extent was not significantly correlated
   with any of the life-history variables. Relative VNNE length was
   negatively correlated with relative gestation length and relative
   neonatal mass (P < 0.05). However, when we corrected for phylogenetic
   relationships, we found no significant correlations between either of
   the neuroepithelial. measurements and life-history variables.
   Immunohistochemical findings suggest that OE has more OMP-reactive cells
   than VNNE in all species. OMP-reactive cells appear to be less numerous
   in diurnal species compared to most nocturnal species. These results
   indicate that the VNNE may be relatively longer at birth in altricial
   species. However, it remains uncertain how phylogeny and/or ontogeny may
   explain these findings.},

   system of this enigmatic lemur, reproductive traits must be
   contextualized in the wild. Here, I provide a preliminary report of
   mating and infant care in one community of wild red ruffed lemurs
   (Varecia rubra). Observations span a 15-month period covering two birth
   seasons and one mating season on the Masoala Peninsula, Madagascar.
   Factors that are not possible to replicate in captivity are reported,
   such as mating pattern, natality and mortality rates, the location of
   nests within the home range, and the structuring of infant care within a
   natural community. V. rubra at Andranobe have a fission-fusion,
   multifemale-multimale grouping pattern and a polygamous mating system.
   They do not mate monogamously or live strictly in family-based groups as
   suggested by previous workers. During the first 2 months of life, nests
   and infant stashing localities are situated within each mother's
   respective core area, and inhabitants of each core area within the
   communal home range provide care for young. As part of their absentee
   parenting system, infants are left in concealed, protected, and
   supportive spots high in the canopy, while mothers travel distantly.
   This practice is termed `infant stashing'. Alloparenting appears to be
   an integral part of V. rubra's overall reproductive strategy in the
   wild, as it was performed by all age-sex classes. Among the alloparental
   behaviors observed were infant guarding, co-stashing, infant transport,
   and allonursing. Alloparenting and absentee parenting may mitigate high
   maternal reproductive costs. Furthermore, V. rubra may have a breeding
   system in which genetic partners (i.e., mating partners) do not always
   correspond to infant care-providers. Combined with recently available
   information on the behavioral ecology of wild ruffed lemurs, this
   preliminary report suggests directions for in-depth studies on Varecia's
   breeding system.},

Abstract = {Roads and powerline corridors destroy canopy connectivity in the
   rainforest of north- east Australia. We tested the hypotheses that
   linear barriers affect ( a) the alignment of home ranges, ( b) use of
   habitat either side of linear barriers, and ( c) the crossing of them by
   the strictly arboreal lemuroid ringtail possum ( Hemibelideus
   lemuroides), which is known to be vulnerable to habitat fragmentation.
   Radio- tracking and a translocation experiment were conducted at a
   narrow 7- m- wide road and an 80- m- wide powerline. Homes ranges of
   lemuroid ringtails ranged from 0.15 to 1.67 ha ( minimum convex polygon)
   and were aligned with the road but not powerline corridors. When
   lemuroid ringtails were experimentally translocated, wider canopy
   clearings over roads reduced their capacity to return to their original
   home range, and the powerline corridor was a nearly insurmountable
   barrier. No possums were observed crossing roads or the powerline
   corridor at ground level or residing in the intervening matrix,
   indicating that loss of canopy connectivity has a negative impact on
   their movements.},

Abstract = {Brek/Lmtk2 (brain-enriched kinase/lemur tyrosine kinase 2) is a member
   of the Aatyk family of kinases that comprises Aatyk1, Brek/Lmtk2/Aatyk2,
   and Aatyk3. Although several potential roles have been proposed for Brek
   and other Aatyk family members, the physiological functions of these
   kinases remain unclear. Here, we report that Brek(-/-) male mice are
   infertile, with azoospermia. Detailed histological analysis revealed
   that Brek(-/-) germ cells differentiated normally until the
   round-spermatid stage, but failed to undergo the normal change in
   morphology to become elongated spermatids. Testicular somatic cells
   appeared normal in these mice. Expression of Brek in testis was
   restricted to the germ cells, suggesting that the maturations of germ
   cells in Brek(-/-) mice are affected in a cell-autonomous manner. On the
   basis of these findings, we concluded that Brek is essential for a late
   stage of spermatogenesis. Further clarification of the mechanism by
   which Brek regulates spermatogenesis may help identify new targets for
   reproductive contraceptives and treatments against infertility.},

Title = {Severe wear and tooth loss in wild ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta): A
   function of feeding ecology, dental structure, and individual life
   history},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {51},
Number = {5},
Pages = {490-505},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The ring-tailed lemurs at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar,
   exhibit a high frequency of severe wear and antemortem tooth loss. As
   part of a long-term study, we collected dental data on 83 living adult
   ring-tailed lemurs during 2003 and 2004. Among these individuals, 192
   teeth were scored as absent. The most frequently missing tooth position
   is MI (24\%). As MI is the first tooth to erupt, its high frequency of
   absence (primarily a result of wear) is not remarkable. However, the
   remaining pattern of tooth loss does not correlate with the sequence of
   eruption. We suggest that this pattern is a function of 1) feeding
   ecology, as hard, tough tamarind fruit is a key fallback food of
   ring-tailed lemurs living in gallery forests; 2) food processing, as
   tamarind fruit is primarily processed in the P3-M1 region of the mouth;
   and 3) tooth structure, as ring-tailed lemurs possess thin dental
   enamel. The incongruity between thin enamel and use of a hard, tough
   fallback food suggests that ring-tailed lemurs living in riverine
   gallery forests may rely on resources not used in the past. When
   comparing dental health in the same individuals (n = 50) between 2003
   and 2004, we found that individual tooth loss can show a rapid increase
   over the span of one year, increasing by as much as 20\%. Despite this
   rapid loss, individuals are able to survive, sometimes benefiting from
   unintentional assistance from conspecifics, from which partially
   processed tamarind fruit is obtained. Although less frequent in this
   population, these longitudinal data also illustrate that ring-tailed
   lemurs lose teeth due to damage and disease, similar to other nonhuman
   primates. The relationship between tooth loss, feeding ecology, dental
   structure, and individual life history in this population has
   implications for interpreting behavior based on tooth loss in the
   hominid fossil record. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {It is widely accepted that natal philopatry is a prerequisite for the
   evolution of sociality. The life-history hypothesis maintains that
   longevity of adults results in extended territory tenure and thus limits
   breeding vacancies for offspring, which makes natal philopatry more
   likely. Here, we tested the importance of longevity for natal philopatry
   in females of a basal primate, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus
   murinus). This species is regarded as being solitary due to its foraging
   habits but while males disperse, female offspring in this species forgo
   dispersal and form long-term sleeping groups with their mothers. We
   tested whether high adult survival could be a cause for natal philopatry
   of female offspring. In addition, we assessed costs and benefits
   associated with space sharing between mothers and daughters and whether
   mothers actively increase survival of daughters by beqeauthal of
   territories, information transfer about resources or thermoregulation.
   Contrary to our predictions, adult females had low-survival rates. Space
   sharing appeared to improve survival of both, mothers and daughters.
   This could be a result of information transfer about sleeping sites and
   thermoregulatory benefits. Our results cast doubt on the idea that
   longevity predisposes species for social traits and provide support for
   benefits of philopatry.},

Abstract = {The ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata variegata), like all other lemurs,
   is endemic to Madagascar and inhabits the eastern rainforests of the
   island. A captive breeding project for this species has been underway
   since the Sixties and lead to a relatively great population of captive
   ruffed lemurs. Part of this population was recorded for the purpose of
   this study. We built a computational model of a non-human primate vocal
   tract deriving information from a silicon cast of a cadaver and then
   compared the predicted acoustic response with the formant pattern
   observed in natural calls. This analysis was performed by considering
   both oral and nasal tracts. In fact, data about first formants, F1 and
   F2, derived from the phonetic analysis of V v. variegata vocalizations,
   were compared to formant values predicted by the computational model,
   showing a moderate percentual difference. The vocal repertoire of
   Varecia sp. features calls showing different formant patterns that can
   be described by mean simple tube and multiple tube systems. For the
   first time, this paper provide vocal tract modeling of a prosimian
   primate and consider variation across different calls. Our findings
   suggest that if formants in some vocal types can be effectively
   predicted by mean of a uniform tube model of the oral vocal tract, other
   vocalizations required the implementation of nasal tract models and
   multi-tube vocal tract emulations.},

Abstract = {The ``design features{''} of a signal are strictly shaped by selective
   forces since they affect the optimality of the signal form. In Lemur
   catta urine deposition can be combined with the following tail
   configurations: (1) tail held up in an evident display (Urine Marking,
   UM); (2) tail slightly raised to avoid its impregnation with urine
   (Urinating, UR). It has recently been demonstrated that only UM has
   marking functions and the visual tail display is only one of the
   features facilitating detection of the signal by the receiver. Other
   features help senders to increase the probability of signal detection
   (e.g. site of deposition and association with other scent depositions).
   In this paper, we ranked using a multivariate general linear model and
   logistic regression the relative importance of such features in shaping
   the two kinds of depositions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that both UM
   and UR have constant depositional features probably in order to improve
   the detectability of the urine marking and the animals' safety during
   urine excretion.},

Abstract = {Aotus lemurinus griseimembra are highly susceptible to infection by
   human malaria parasites and reproduce some of its clinical
   manifestations, including anemia. We developed a new surgical technique
   to obtain bone marrow samples from Aotus by surgical aspiration of the
   femur. First, we determined that the femur offered advantages over other
   bones, primarily due to lower fracture vulnerability. We tested a
   surgical technique using 20 G IV catheters in formaldehyde-preserved
   animals, then conducted the procedure on 27 live animals. This technique
   provided easy, quick surgical access to adequate volumes of bone marrow
   and was safe for almost all animals: only one died; another developed

Title = {Masseter electromyography during chewing in ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur
   catta)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {130},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We examined masseter recruitment and firing patterns during chewing in
   four adult ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta), using electromyography
   (EMG). During chewing of tougher foods, the working-side superficial
   masseter tends to show, on average, 1.7 times more scaled EMG activity
   than the balancing-side superficial masseter. The working-side deep
   masseter exhibits, on average, 2.4 times the scaled EMG activity of the
   balancing-side deep masseter. The relatively larger activity in the
   working-side muscles suggests that ring-tailed lemurs recruit relatively
   less force from their balancing-side muscles during chewing. The
   superficial masseter working-to-balancing-side (W/B) ratio for lemurs
   overlaps with W/B ratios from anthropoid primates. In contrast, the
   lemur W/B ratio for the deep masseter is more similar to that of greater
   galagos, while both are significantly larger than W/B ratios of
   anthropoids. Because ring-tailed lemurs have unfused and hence
   presumably weaker symphyses, these data are consistent with the
   symphyseal fusion-muscle recruitment hypothesis stating that symphyseal
   fusion in anthropoids provides increased strength for resisting forces
   created by the balancing-side jaw muscles during chewing. Among the
   masseter muscles of ring-tailed lemurs, the working-side deep masseter
   peaks first on average, followed in succession by the balancing-side
   deep masseter, balancing-side superficial masseter, and finally the
   working-side super-galagos in that their balancing-side deep masseter
   peaks well before their working-side superficial masseter. We see the
   opposite pattern in anthropoids, where the balancing-side deep masseter
   peaks, on average, after the working-side superficial masseter. This
   late activity of the balancing-side deep masseter in anthropoids is
   linked to lateral-transverse bending, or wishboning, of their mandibular
   symphyses. Subsequently, the stresses incurred during wishboning are
   hypothesized to be a proximate reason for strengthening, and hence
   fusion, of the anthropoid symphysis. Thus, the absence of this
   muscle-firing pattern in ring-tailed lemurs with their weaker, unfused
   symphyses provides further correlational support for the symphyseal
   fusion late-acting balancing-side deep masseter hypothesis linking
   wishboning and symphyseal strengthening in anthropoids. The early peak
   activity of the working-side deep masseter in ringtailed lemurs is
   unlike galagos and most similar to the pattern seen in macaques and
   baboons. We hypothesize that this early activity of the working-side
   deep masseter moves the lower jaw both laterally toward the working side
   and vertically upward, to position it for the upcoming power stroke.
   From an evolutionary perspective, the differences in peak firing times
   for the working-side deep masseter between ring-tailed lemurs and
   greater galagos indicate that deep masseter firing patterns are not
   conserved among strepsirrhines. Am J Phys Anthropol 130:85-95, 2006. (c)

Abstract = {Forest edges are dynamic zones characterized by the penetration (to
   varying depths and intensities) of conditions from the surrounding
   environment (matrix) into the forest interior. Although edge effects
   influence many tropical organisms, they have not been studied directly
   in primates. Edge effects are particularly relevant to lemurs because of
   the highly fragmented forest landscapes found in Madagascar. In this
   study, data are presented regarding how the densities of six lemur
   species (Avahi laniger, Cheirogaleus major, Eulemur rubriventer,
   Hapalemur griseus griseus, Microcebus rufus, and Propithecus diadema
   edwardsi) varied between six 500-m interior transects and six 500-m edge
   transects in the Vohibola III Classified Forest in SE Madagascar.
   Diurnal (n = 433) and nocturnal (n = 128) lemur surveys were conducted
   during June-October 2003 and May-November 2004. A. laniger, E.
   rubriventer, and H. g. griseus exhibited a neutral edge response (no
   differences in densities between habitats). M. rufus and P. d. edwardsi
   had a positive edge response (higher densities in edge habitats), which
   may be related to edge-related variations in food abundance and quality.
   Positive edge responses by M. rufus and P. d. edwardsi may ultimately be
   detrimental due to edge-related anthropogenic factors (e.g., hunting by
   local people). The negative edge response exhibited by C. major (lower
   densities in edge habitats) may result from heightened ambient
   temperatures that inhibit torpor in edge habitats.},

   sternite 3, and four groups of setae and hair-like projections. The
   hair-like projections (hairs of group 3 and 4) are shown to be
   associated with a layer of glandular units, which may be the source of
   ant-attracting or paralyzing secretions. Apart from these glandular
   units, a second type of glands is present on the sternum. These so far
   undocumented glandular units are arranged in distinct areas on the
   pregenitalic sternites, and are conspicuous by their large pores. Nymphs
   of P. lemur do not possess a trichome, but the glandular areas on the

Volume = {129},

Abstract = {Edge effects are caused by the penetration of abiotic and biotic
   conditions from the matrix into forest interiors. Although edge effects
   influence the biogeography of many tropical organisms, they have not
   been studied directly in primates. Edge effects are particularly
   relevant to lemurs due to the loss of 80-90\% of forests in Madagascar.
   In this study, data are presented on how biotic edge effects influenced
   the distribution and density of lemurs in the Vohibola III Classified
   Forest in southeastern Madagascar. In total, 415 lemur surveys were
   conducted during June-October 2003 and May-September 2004 along six
   1,250-m transects that ran perpendicular to the forest edge. Data were
   also collected on lemur food trees along the six transects (density,
   height, diameter at breast height, area, volume, and distance to forest
   edge). Four nocturnal species (Avahi laniger, Cheirogaleus major,
   Lepilemur microdon, and Microcebus rufus) and four diurnal species
   (Eulemur rubriventer, Eulemur fulvus rufus, Hapalemur grisesus griseus,
   and Propithecus diadema edwardsi) were sighted during surveys.
   Regression analyses of lemur densities as a function of distance to
   forest edge provided edge tolerances for A. laniger (edge-tolerant), M.
   rufus (edge-tolerant), E. rubriventer (edge-tolerant or omnipresent),
   and H. g. griseus (omnipresent). The density and distribution of M.
   rufus and their foods trees were correlated. Edge-related variations in
   food quality and predation pressures may also be influencing lemurs in
   Vohibola III. Tolerance for edge effects may explain, in part, how
   lemurs have survived extreme habitat loss and forest fragmentation in
   southeastern Madagascar. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The assembly, inspection, and maintenance requirements of permanent
   installations in space demand robots that provide a high level of
   operational flexibility relative to mass and volume. Such demands point
   to robots that are dexterous, have significant processing and sensing
   capabilities, and can be easily reconfigured (both physically and
   algorithmically). Evolving from Lemur I, Lemur Ha is an extremely
   capable system that both explores mechanical design elements and
   provides an infrastructure for the development of algorithms (such as
   force control for mobility and manipulation and adaptive visual
   feedback). The physical layout of the system consists of six,
   4-degree-of-freedom limbs arranged axisymmetrically about a hexagonal
   body platform. These limbs incorporate a ``quick-connect{''}
   end-effector feature below the distal Joint that allows the rapid
   change-out of any of its tools. The other major subsystem is a stereo
   camera set that travels along a ring track, allowing omnidirectional
   vision. The current Lemur IIa platform represents the jumping-off point
   toward more advanced robotic platforms that will support NASA's Vision
   for Space Exploration, which calls for a sustained presence in space.
   This paper lays out the mechanical, electrical, and algorithmic elements
   of Lemur Ha and discusses the future directions of development in those
   areas.},

Abstract = {To extract the full science potential from planetary surface operations,
   robots must be able to access the entire surface of the planetary body,
   not just the relatively level areas. Buoyed by the success of
   top-to-bottom strategies employing tethered robots, the stage is set for
   bottom-to-top technologies and techniques to be investigated. To this
   end, we have designed and built Lemur IIb, a 4-limbed robotic system
   that is being used to investigate several aspects of climbing system
   design including the mechanical system (novel end-effectors, kinematics,
   joint design), sensing (force, attitude, vision), low-level control
   (force-control for tactile sensing and stability management), and
   planning (joint trajectories for stability). The technologies developed
   on this platform will be used to build an advanced system that will
   climb slopes up to and including vertical faces and overhangs and be
   able to react forces to maintain stability and do useful work (e.g.,
   sample acquisition/instrument placement). Among the most advanced of
   these technologies is a new class of Ultrasonic/Sonic Driller/Corer
   (USDC) end-effectors capable of creating ``holds{''} in rock and soil as
   well as sampling those substrates. This paper lays out the mechanical,
   electrical, and algorithmic elements of the Lemur Hb robot and discusses
   the future directions of development in those areas.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Introduces the Lemur IIb robot which allows the investigation
   of the technical hurdles associated with free climbing in steep terrain.
   These include controlling the distribution of contact forces during
   motion to ensure holds remain intact and to enable mobility through
   over-hangs. Efforts also can be applied to further in-situ
   characterization of the terrain, such as testing the strength of the
   holds and developing models of the individual holds and a terrain map.
   Design/methodology/approach - A free climbing robot system was designed
   and integrated. Climbing end-effector were investigated and operational
   algorithms were developed.
   Findings - A 4-limbed robotic system used to investigate several aspects
   of climbing system design including the mechanical system (novel
   end-effectors, kinematics, joint design), sensing (force, attitude,
   vision), low-level control (force-control for tactile sensing and
   stability management), and planning (joint trajectories for stability).
   A new class of Ultrasonic/Sonic Driller/Corer (USDC) end-effectors
   capable of creating ``holds{''} in rock and soil as well as sampling
   those substrates.
   Practical implications - Planetary exploration of cliff faces. Search
   and rescue in steep terrain. Robotic scouting and surveillance in
   natural environments.
   Originality/value - The technologies developed on this platform will be
   used to build an advanced system that will climb slopes up to and
   including vertical faces and overhangs and be able to react forces to
   maintain stability and do useful work (e.g. sample
   acquisition/instrument placement).},

Title = {Eye morphology in cathemeral lemurids and other mammals},

Abstract = {The visual systems of cathemeral mammals are subject to selection
   pressures that are not encountered by strictly diurnal or nocturnal
   species. In particular, the cathemeral eye and retina must be able to
   function effectively across a broad range of ambient light intensities.
   This paper provides a review of the current state of knowledge regarding
   the visual anatomy of cathemeral primates, and presents an analysis of
   the influence of cathemerality on eye morphology in the genus Eulemur.
   Due to the mutual antagonism between most adaptations for increased
   visual acuity and sensitivity, cathemeral lemurs are expected to
   resemble other cathemeral mammals in having eye morphologies that are
   intermediate between those of diurnal and nocturnal close relatives.
   However, if lemurs only recently adopted cathemeral activity patterns,
   then cathemeral lemurids would be expected to demonstrate eye
   morphologies more comparable to those of nocturnal strepsirrhines. Both
   predictions were tested through a comparative study of relative cornea
   size in mammals. Intact eyes were collected from 147 specimens of 55
   primate species, and relative corneal dimensions were compared to
   measurements taken from a large sample of non-primate mammals. These
   data reveal that the five extant species of the cathemeral genus Eulemur
   have relative cornea sizes intermediate between those of diurnal and
   nocturnal strepsirrhines. Moreover, all Eulemur species have relative
   cornea sizes that are comparable to those of cathemeral non-primate
   mammals and significantly smaller than those of nocturnal mammals. These
   results suggest that Eulemur species resemble other cathemeral mammals
   in having eyes that are adapted to function under variable environmental
   light levels. These results also suggest that cathemerality is a
   relatively ancient adaptation in Eulemur that was present in the last
   common ancestor of the genus (ca. 8-12 MYA). Copyright (c) 2006 S.

Abstract = {We studied a black lemur population over a 2-year period (1992-1993) and
   8 years later (2000) in a 50-ha secondary forest in northwest
   Madagascar. All of the animals were marked to investigate population
   dynamics and seasonal variation in ranging and behavior, and new data on
   black lemurs were obtained. Our data on demographic characteristics were
   expanded to include other forest sites and contrasted with those
   collected in other Eulemur macaco macaco field studies, in relation to
   human activity and the presence of introduced and cultivated plant
   species. Density is affected by deforestation and hunting. Group size
   and home range depend on the composition of the forest and probably food
   patches. Sex ratio at birth varies according to the number of females
   per group, a result that fits the local resource competition model.
   Groups are multimale-multifemale, and adult females form the core of the
   groups. Reproductive parameters indicate sharply defined seasonal
   breeding, a high female reproductive rate, and birth synchrony. Changes
   in group composition reveal male and female juvenile dispersal, male
   transfer between groups at the time of mating, and adult female transfer
   and group fission when groups exceed a critical size. At mating and
   birth, intergroup agonistic encounters occurred at home-range
   boundaries, and larger groups were dominant over smaller groups.
   Patterns of intragroup interactions suggest that males compete for
   access to groups of females during the mating season, and that females
   may compete for food resources during the birth season. Our study also
   reports female social dominance and lack of sexual weight dimorphism in
   this species.},

   Experiments 3 and 4 presented problems in which some of the tools'

Title = {Arginine-vasopressin and vasointestinal polypeptide rhythms in the
   suprachiasmatic nucleus of the mouse lemur reveal aging-related
   alterations of circadian pacemaker neurons in a non-human primate},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {902-910},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, the mammalian
   circadian pacemaker, is entrained by external cues and especially by
   photic information. Light is transmitted primarily via the
   retinohypothalamic tract, which terminates in the ventral part (or core)
   of the SCN, where vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-containing
   neurons are located. VIP cells are mainly intrinsic and project to the
   dorsal part (or shell) of the SCN, where neurons containing
   arginine-vasopressin (AVP) reside. As aging leads to marked changes in
   the expression of circadian rhythms, we examined in primates whether
   age-related decay in biological rhythmicity is associated with changes
   in the oscillation of peptide expression in SCN neurons. We used double
   immunohistochemistry and quantitative analysis in the SCN of mouse
   lemurs, which provide a unique model of aging in non-human primates. In
   adult animals, VIP-positive and AVP-positive SCN neurons exhibited daily
   rhythms of their number and immunostaining intensity: AVP
   immunoreactivity peaked during the second part of the day, and VIP
   peaked during the night. In aged mouse lemurs, the peaks of AVP and VIP
   immunopositivity were significantly shifted, so that AVP was most
   intense at the beginning of the night, whereas VIP peaked at the
   beginning of daytime. The results show that the circadian rhythm of
   neuropeptides in the SCN is modified by aging in primates, with a
   differential regulation of the two main peptidergic cell populations.
   These changes may affect the ability of the SCN to transmit rhythmic
   information to other neural target sites, and thereby to modify the
   expression of some biological rhythms.},

Abstract = {Seven species of dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus spp.) are currently
   recognized after a recent revision of the genus. During a field study in
   southeastern Madagascar, we observed 3 distinct morphotypes of
   Cheirogaleus resembling Cheirogaleus medius, C. major and C. crossleyi.
   In particular, for Cheirogaleus crossleyi southeastern Madagascar was
   far away from the known distribution range of the species when referring
   to the recent revision of the genus. In order to clarify the taxonomic
   status of the 3 morphotypes, we compared field samples from southeastern
   Madagascar to museum specimens from several locations in Madagascar and
   to field samples from Kirindy/CFPF, western Madagascar by genetic
   analyses using the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Genetic data yield
   strong support for 2 of the 3 morphotypes to represent Cheirogaleus
   medius and C. major. The third morphotype is genetically closely related
   to Cheirogaleus crossleyi, albeit more distantly than the other 2
   morphotypes to the respective reference samples. The genetic distance is
   related to a considerable geographic distance between the location of
   our field study and the origin of the respective reference specimen,
   because Cheirogaleus crossleyi had been reported only from northern
   Madagascar. Our field observations indicate an isolated population in
   southeastern Madagascar. We propose to identify them as Cheirogaleus
   crossleyi and discuss the population genetic and biogeographic
   considerations supporting this conclusion.},

   distribution of individuals in the study area. Using 10 microsatellite
   markers, significant genetic differentiation in the study area was
   demonstrated and dispersal was found to be significantly male biased.
   Furthermore, we observed an overall excess of homozygotes in the total
   population (F-IT = 0.131), which we interpret as caused by fine-scale
   structure with breeding occurring in small units. Evidence for a clumped
   distribution of identical homozygotes was found, supporting the notion
   that dispersal distance for breeding was shorter than that for foraging,
   i.e. the breeding neighbourhood size is smaller than the foraging
   neighbourhood size. In conclusion, we found a more complex population
   structure than what has been previously reported in studies performed on
   smaller spatial scales. The noncontinuous distribution of individuals
   and the effects of social variables on the genetic structure have
   implications for the interpretation of social organization and the
   planning of conservation activities that may apply to other solitary and
   endangered mammals as well.},

Journal = {HUMAN REPRODUCTION},

Volume = {20},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1504-1510},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In primates, including humans, bias of sex ratio at birth
   has been reported to depend on maternal condition at conception. In a
   Malagasy primate, the gray mouse lemur, male-biased sex ratio at birth
   occurred in captive parous females. The male bias was previously
   demonstrated to be pre-conceptual and independent of the female's
   nutritional state. It was hypothesized to be related to changes in
   hormonal state at ovulation. METHODS and RESULTS: The relationship
   between urinary estradiol (E-2) levels during the follicular phase until
   estrus and litter production (number and sex of newborns) was assessed
   in 91 females mated under controlled conditions. Changes in E-2 levels
   prior to ovulation followed the typical primate pattern characterized by
   a gradual rise during the 10 days preceding the sharp increase at
   estrus. A clear decline in E-2 levels occurred with ageing. Direction of
   the sex ratio bias was unrelated to E-2 levels at ovulation time but was
   significantly dependent on E-2 levels during the follicular phase.
   Reduced E-2 levels prior to estrus led to male-biased litters.
   CONCLUSION: This study suggests that hormonal stimulation during the
   follicular phase plays a role in shifting sex ratio at conception
   through changes in the local environment of the ova. This hypothesis
   deserves testing by assessing estrogen levels throughout the follicular
   phase in other primate species including humans.},

Volume = {66},

Abstract = {Although many Malagasy lemurs are thought to be female dominant and to
   have female feeding priority, to date the relationship between these
   behaviors has been rigorously established only in Lemur catta, and other
   ways that females might achieve feeding priority have not been examined
   closely. Erhart and Overdorff {[}International Journal of Primatology
   20:927-940, 1999] suggested that one way female primates achieve feeding
   priority is to initiate and lead groups to food, thereby gaining access
   to the food first and positively influencing their food intake compared
   to other group members. Here we describe female dominance patterns and
   potential measures of feeding priority in two groups of black-and-white
   ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata) that were observed over a 15-month
   period in southeastern Madagascar. We predicted that the females would
   1) be consistently dominant to males, 2) lead groups to food sources
   more often than males, and 3) have higher feeding rates compared to
   males when they arrived at food sources first. The results were
   dissimilar between the study groups. During the study, the oldest adult
   female in group 1 died. There was no evidence for female dominance in
   this group, and the remaining (likely natal) female did not lead the
   group more often, nor did she have a higher food intake than males.
   Group 1 dispersed shortly after the time frame reported here. In
   contrast, the resident female in group 2 was dominant to group males
   (based on agonistic interactions), led the group to food sources more
   often, and experienced a higher food intake when she arrived first at a
   food source. How these patterns vary over time and are influenced by the
   number of females in groups, group stability, food quality, and
   reproductive condition will be examined in future analyses. (c) 2005

Abstract = {The papers in this issue were presented at a symposium during the 25th
   Annual Meeting of the American Society of Primatologists held in
   Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in June 2002. This symposium brought together
   many of the scientists who have contributed to our knowledge of ruffed
   lemur ecology, behavior, and conservation in the past decade. One
   objective was to share and compare key findings about ruffed lemurs
   (Varecia) resulting from long-term field studies at various sites in
   Madagascar. A second objective was to cross-fertilize work being done in
   the wild with that being done in captivity, with the aim of advancing a
   common conservation mission for this critically endangered genus.
   Varecia is a prime candidate for synthetic assessments such as these
   because it has now been studied in both the northern and southern
   reaches of its geographic range, and has also been the focus of a
   captive-to-wild reinforcement project. The papers in this issue
   contribute to 1) the establishment of reference ranges for a suite of
   physiological parameters in healthy wild Varecia populations; 2)
   environmental enrichment aimed at preserving species-typical behaviors
   in captivity; 3) an understanding of how forest structure, floristic
   composition, and fruiting phenology in areas with differing disturbance
   histories correlate with the natural occurrence and abundance of
   Varecia; 4) primary knowledge concerning dominance relations between the
   sexes and group leadership in wild Varecia; and 5) primary knowledge
   concerning how wild Varecia, with their unusual reproductive pattern and
   heavy reliance on fruit, modulate their activity budgets seasonally and
   in tandem with reproductive stages. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The black and white ruffed lemur, Varecia variegata, which is endemic to
   Madagascar, is under the threat of extinction due to the loss and
   fragmentation of its natural habitat, a consequence of deforestation.
   Behavioural researchers studying a population of V variegata inhabiting
   the Manombo Special Reserve, noted that over a 4-year period, none of
   the family groups within the reserve produced offspring while those in
   neighbouring populations had been reproductively successful. Inbreeding
   depression was postulated as the trigger for this occurrence. However,
   another explanation exists. A cyclone, striking the region in 1997,
   destroyed a large percentage of the mature fruit-producing trees that V.
   variegata relied upon as a food source, which is likely to have produced
   a nutritional deficit. A panel of 25 simple sequence repeat (SSR)
   markers was utilised to assess the genetic diversity within four V.
   variegata populations, including individuals from Manombo and three
   other populations in southeastern Madagascar. The data revealed that the
   level of genetic diversity apparent within the Manombo population is
   comparable to the other groups studied. Therefore, it seems probable
   that genetic factors are not responsible for the recent lack of
   reproductive success on the part of the V. variegata at Manombo Special
   Reserve.},

Abstract = {We investigated the importance of the major histocompatibility complex
   (MHC) constitution on the parasite burden of free-ranging mouse lemurs
   (Microcebus murinus) in four littoral forest fragments in southeastern
   Madagascar. Fourteen different MHC class II DRB-exon 2 alleles were
   found in 228 individuals with high levels of sequence divergence between
   alleles. More nonsynonymous than synonymous substitutions in the
   functional important antigen recognition and binding sites indicated
   selection processes maintaining MHC polymorphism. Animals from the four
   forest fragments differed in their infection status (being infected or
   not), in the number of different nematode morphotypes per individual
   (NNI) as well as in the fecal egg counts (FEC) values. Heterozygosity in
   general was uncorrelated with any of these measures of infection.
   However, a positive relationship was found between specific alleles and
   parasite load. Whereas the common allele Mimu-DRB{*}1 was more
   frequently found in infected individuals and in individuals with high
   NNI and FEC values (high parasite load), the rare alleles Mimu-DRB{*}6
   and 10 were more prevalent in uninfected individuals and in individuals
   with low NNI and FEC values (low parasite load). These three alleles
   associated with parasite load had unique amino acid motifs in the
   antigen binding sites. This distinguished them from the remaining 11
   Mimu-DRB alleles. Our results support the hypothesis that MHC
   polymorphism in M. murinus is maintained through pathogen-driven
   selection acting by frequency-dependent selection. This is the first
   study of the association of MHC variation and parasite burden in a
   free-ranging primate.},

Abstract = {Microcebus murinus, a small nocturnal Malagasy primate, exhibits
   adaptive energy-saving strategies such as daily hypothermia and
   gregarious patterns during diurnal rest. To determine whether ambient
   temperature (T-a), food restriction and nest sharing can modify the
   daily body temperature (T-b) rhythm, T-b was recorded by telemetry
   during winter in six males exposed to different ambient temperatures
   (T-a=25, 20, 15 degrees C) and/or to a total food restriction for 3 days
   depending on social condition (isolated versus pair-grouped). At 25
   degrees C, the daily rhythm of T-b was characterized by high T-b values
   during the night and lower values during the day. Exposure to cold
   significantly decreased minimal T-b values and lengthened the daily
   hypothermia. Under food restriction, minimal T-b values were also
   markedly lowered. The combination of food restriction and cold induced
   further increases in duration and depth of torpor bouts, minimal (T)b
   reaching a level just above T-a. Although it influenced daily
   hypothermia less than environmental factors, nest sharing modified
   effects of cold and food restriction previously observed by lengthening
   duration of torpor but without increasing its depth. In response to
   external conditions, mouse lemurs may thus adjust their energy
   expenditures through daily modifications of both the duration and the
   depth of torpor.},

   resting metabolism (RMR) and free thyroxin levels in plasma (T4) were
   measured in males abruptly transferred to SP: six intact males
   (controls), eight males that underwent bilateral olfactory removal (BOX)
   and eight males exposed to male urinary cues (U-exposed). To assess the
   effect of SP exposure, two other groups were maintained for 6 weeks
   under LP: six controls and six BOX males. Whereas all studied parameters
   remained constant in controls and BOX males maintained under LP.
   exposure to SP led to different responses according to groups. In
   controls, SP exposure led to a regular increase in body mass and after 4
   weeks under SP, plasma T4 levels, food consumption and RMR significantly
   decreased. Even if BOX males demonstrated hyperphagic patterns
   regardless of the photoperiod, an increase in body mass was also induced
   by SP exposure but without changes in RMR or food intake that were body
   mass-dependent. In U-exposed males, body mass gain was significantly
   reduced while food intake and RMR remained high. In both BOX and
   U-exposed males, SP exposure led to a transient but high increase in T4
   levels compared to controls. These results suggest that
   olfaction/olfactory cues may delay the SP-mediated changes in energy
   balance. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Schultz's unruly rule: Dental developmental sequences and schedules in
   small-bodied, folivorous lemurs},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {76},

Pages = {77-99},
Abstract = {Schultz's rule ( as reconstructed by Smith) states that there is a
   relationship between the pattern ( or relative order) of eruption of
   molar versus secondary ( replacement) teeth and the overall pace ( or
   absolute timing) of growth and maturation. Species with `fast' life
   histories ( rapid dental development, rapid growth, early sexual
   maturation, short life spans) are said to exhibit relatively early
   eruption of the molars and late eruption of the secondary replacement
   teeth ( premolars, canines, incisors), whereas species with `slow' life
   histories are said to exhibit relatively late eruption of the molars and
   early eruption of the secondary dentition. In a recent review, B. H.
   Smith noted that primates with tooth combs might violate this rule
   because tooth combs tend to erupt early, regardless of the pace of life
   history. We show that exceptions to Schultz's rule among lemurs are not
   limited to the relative timing of eruption of the tooth comb. Rather,
   among lemurs, some species with extremely accelerated dental development
   exhibit a pattern of eruption of molars and of secondary teeth in direct
   opposition to the expectations of Schultz's rule. We focus particularly
   on the pattern ( order) and pace ( absolute timing) of dental
   development and eruption in Avahi and Lepilemur - two relatively small,
   nocturnal folivores with rapid dental development. These taxa differ
   markedly in their eruption sequences ( the premolars erupt after M2 and
   M3 in Lepilemur but not Avahi). We offer an explanation for the failure
   of Schultz's rule to predict these differences. Schultz's rule presumes
   that eruption timing is dependent on the size of the jaw and that,
   therefore, molar crown formation and eruption will be delayed in species
   with slow-growing jaws. We show that a variety of processes ( including
   developmental imbrication) allows the crowns of permanent teeth to form
   and to erupt into jaws that might appear to be too small to accommodate
   them.},

Title = {Redistribution of CB1 cannabinoid receptors during evolution of
   cholinergic basal forebrain territories and their cortical projection

   Primates) and rat},
Journal = {NEUROSCIENCE},

Abstract = {Endocannabinoid signaling, mediated by presynaptic CB1 cannabinoid
   receptors on neurons, is fundamental for the maintenance of synaptic
   plasticity by modulating neurotransmitter release from axon terminals.
   In the rodent basal forebrain, CB1 cannabinoid receptor-like
   immunoreactivity is only harbored by a subpopulation of cholinergic
   projection neurons. However, endocannabinoid control of cholinergic
   output from the substantia innominata, coincident target innervation of
   cholinergic and CB1 cannabinoid receptor-containing afferents, and
   cholinergic regulation of endocannabinoid synthesis in the hippocampus
   suggest a significant cholinergic-endocannabinergic interplay. Given the
   functional importance of the cholinergic modulation of endocannabinoid
   signaling, here we studied CB, cannabinoid receptor distribution in
   cholinergic basal forebrain territories and their cortical projection
   areas in a prosimian primate, the gray mouse lemur. Perisomatic CB1
   cannabinoid receptor immunoreactivity was unequivocally present in
   non-cholinergic neurons of the olfactory tubercule, and in
   cholecystokinin-containing interneurons in layers 2/3 of the neocortex.
   Significantly, CB1 cannabinoid receptor-like immunoreactivity was
   localized to cholinergic perikarya in the magnocellular basal nucleus.
   However, cortical cholinergic terminals lacked detectable CB1
   cannabinold receptor levels. A dichotomy of CB1 cannabinoid receptor
   distribution in frontal (suprasylvian) and parietotemporal (subsylvian)
   cortices was apparent. In the frontal cortex, CB1 cannabinoid
   receptor-containing axons concentrated in layers 2/3 and layer 6, while
   layer 4 and layer 5 were essentially devoid of CB1 cannabinoid receptor
   immunoreactivity. In contrast, CB1 cannabinoid receptors decorated axons
   in all layers of the parietotemporal cortex with peak densities in layer
   2 and layer 4. In the hippocampus, CB1 cannabinoid receptor-containing
   terminals concentrated around pyramidal cell somata and proximal
   dendrites in the CA1-CA3 areas, and granule cell dendrites in the
   molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. CB1 cannabinoid receptors
   frequently localized to inhibitory GABAergic terminals while leaving
   glutamatergic boutons unlabeled. Aging did not affect either the density
   or layer-specific distribution of CB1 cannabinoid
   receptor-immunoreactive processes. We concluded that organizing
   principles of CB1 cannabinoid receptor-containing neurons and their
   terminal fields within the basal forebrain are evolutionarily conserved
   between rodents and prosimian primates. In contrast, the areal expansion
   and cytoarchitectonic differentiation of neocortical subfields in
   primates is associated with differential cortical patterning of CB1,
   cannabinold receptor-containing subcortical and intracortical afferents.

Title = {Shape of the lateral mandibular outline in lemuridae: A quantitative
   analysis of variability using elliptical Fourier analysis},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {76},
Number = {5},
Pages = {245-261},
Abstract = {While several morphometric analyses in lemurids have focused on the
   craniofacial complex, the characterization of their mandibular
   morphology has received less attention. The mandibular outline, in
   lateral perspective, was quantified using elliptical Fourier analysis,
   in an osteological sample encompassing 189 lemurid mandibles (66
   Eulemur, 51 Hapalemur, 22 Lemur and 50 Varecia), and compared using
   multivariate statistical techniques. The taxonomic value of this outline
   in Lemuridae was demonstrated by the existence of significant
   separations between the four genera studied. In particular, the
   mandibular morphology of Hapalemur was markedly different from that in
   the group Eulemur-Lemur-Varecia. Excluding Hapalemur from analysis, the
   distinctions between Eulemur, Lemur and Varecia were enhanced suggesting
   the existence of more subtle intergeneric differences in mandibular
   morphology. Variation in mandibular form was greatest in Hapalemur and
   smallest in Eulemur and Varecia (as demonstrated by the mean values of
   interindividual distances); variation was higher in Lemur than in
   Eulemur and Varecia, but not higher than in Hapalemur. This
   morphological diversity may be related to functional adaptation in
   response to particular dietary habits. The patterns of intergeneric and
   intrageneric shape variations of the mandible in Lemuridae presented
   here provide a valuable resource for the analysis of variation among
   living and fossil lemurids. Copyright (c) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

Abstract = {We measured concentrations of total phenolics (TP), condensed tannins
   (CT), and total alkaloids, as well as bovine serum albumin precipitation
   (BSAp), in leaves of lianas, trees, and palms from six tropical forests
   (four rainforests plus one dry forest in Mayotte Island, and one
   anthropogenic rainforest in Madagascar). We established chemical
   profiles for each site, weighting metabolite concentrations found in
   mature tree leaves by relative tree species abundance (as measured by
   dbh along transects). Alkaloids were generally rare, except in the
   anthropogenic forest, in which introduced mango trees and cashew trees
   are abundant. In contrast, the six forest sites differed considerably
   with regard to TP, CT, and BSAp, due to variation in the local abundance
   of a few anti nutrient-rich plant species. Such variation does not
   conform in any simple way to current theories on the evolution of plant
   chemical defences. Current theories predict that environments with
   similar plant diversity, as in all 6 forests studied here (mostly
   including insular forests), should exhibit the same category of
   anti-herbivore chemical defence (tannin versus alkaloid strategy sensu
   Lebreton or Feeny). It is possible that distribution patterns of
   secondary compounds in Mayotte forests actually result from peculiar
   dynamics of plant-herbivore interactions, as may be expected in insular
   ecosystems with low biodiversity, high rates of endemism, and eventually
   lack of equilibrium between populations of herbivores and plants. The
   relative lack of phenolics and alkaloids in the humid forests growing on
   Mayotte's fertile volcanic soils may also be interpreted according to
   the resource availability theory of Coley et al. (1985). In environments
   where nutrients are widely available, costs of replacing leaves ingested
   by herbivores may be lower than costs of investing in chemical defences.
   Frugivorous/folivorous lemurs (Eulemur fulvus and Eulemur macaco)
   occurring in the study forests differed markedly with regard to their
   ability to tolerate phenolic compounds. Leaf choice of E. macaco (but
   not E. fulvus) was negatively correlated to TP and BSAp. The
   differential deterrent effect of secondary metabolites has ramifications
   for lemur diet width, population densities, and ecological plasticity.
   The positive correlation between TP and BSAp (and lack of correlation
   between CT and BSAp) suggests that total phenolics should be used
   instead of condensed tannins in models predicting densities of
   leaf-eating primates based on the nutritional quality of the
   environment.},

Abstract = {The objective of our study was to investigate the spatial distribution
   and genetic structure of a solitary primate at the microgeographical
   scale of adjacent local populations. We obtained spatial data and tissue
   samples for mtDNA analysis from 205 gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   murinus) captured along transects and within 3 grid systems within a
   12.3 km(2) area in Kirindy Forest, western Madagascar. Our capture data
   revealed that, even though the forest was continuous, gray mouse lemurs
   were not evenly distributed, and that daily and maximum dispersal
   distances were significantly greater in males. The frequency
   distribution of 22 mtDNA D-loop haplotypes was highly skewed. Nine
   haplotypes were unique to males, indicating male-mediated gene flow from
   surrounding areas. The geographic distribution of haplotypes revealed
   that males were also more dispersed than females. Females with the same
   haplotype showed a tendency towards spatial aggregation, and the
   correlation between genetic and geographic distances was higher in
   females. In several areas of the forest, however, spatially clustered
   females were not of the same haplotype, and females were not always
   found in clusters. Hence, in contrast to suggestions from previous
   studies, matrilineal clustering is not the only way females are socially
   organized. In addition, our study revealed heterogeneity and patterns in
   population structure that were not evident at smaller spatial scales,
   some of which may be relevant for designing conservation strategies.},

Abstract = {Daily variation in niche use among vertebrates is attributed to a
   variety of factors, including thermoregulatory, reproductive, and
   nutritional requirements. Lemuriform primates exhibit many behavioral
   and physiological adaptations related to thermoregulation and sharp,
   seasonal reproduction, yet they have rarely been subjects of a
   quantitative analysis of circadian (or daily) rhythms in niche use. In
   this study, I document daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use over
   an annual cycle in two sympatric, frugivorous lemurs, Varecia rubra and
   Eulemur fulvus albifrons. Data on diet, forest site, and forest height
   were recorded at 5-min time points on focal animals and divided into
   three time blocks for analysis (06:00-10:00 hr, 10:00-14:00 hr, and
   14:00-18:00 hr). I employed multivariate tests of independence to
   examine daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use according to sex,
   season, and reproductive stage. Throughout the day, V. rubra is
   frugivorous and dwells in the upper canopy, with notable departures
   (especially for females) during the hot seasons, gestation, and
   lactation. E. f. albifrons has heterogeneous daily rhythms of food
   choice and microhabitat use, particularly across seasons, and both sexes
   are equally variable. These daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use
   appear related to thermoregulatory and nutritional requirements,
   seasonal food availability and circadian rhythms of plant (and possibly
   insect) palatability, predator avoidance tactics, and in the case of
   Varecia, to reproduction. Daily rhythms of food choice in V. rubra
   support two previously suggested hypotheses explaining why primates
   consume more nonfruit items late in the day, whereas those of E. f
   albifrons are too variable to lend support to these hypotheses. (C) 2004

Abstract = {Data collected on the feeding behavior, food intake, and chemical
   analyses of plant foods were used to document seasonal variation in diet
   and nutrition in Eulemur mongoz in northwestern Madagascar. E. mongoz
   conforms to the general Eulemur dietary pattern, with a predominantly
   frugivorous diet supplemented mainly by leaves, flowers, and nectar.
   Phytochemical analysis revealed high water contents in all the main
   plant foods; mature fruit and flowers contained the most water-soluble
   carbohydrates; immature leaves were richest in protein and essential
   amino acids; the limiting amino acids in all plant foods were methionine
   and cystine; ash (mineral) content was highest in petioles and mature
   leaves; crude lipid content was highest in seeds; and crude fiber
   content was indistinguishable between immature and mature fruit and
   leaves. High-fiber foods were eaten during both seasons; the wet season
   diet was dominated by high-energy foods (mature fruit, nectar, and
   seeds), while the dry season diet contained foods high in energy (mature
   fruit and flowers) and high in protein (immature leaves) and minerals
   (mature leaves and petioles). However, nutrient intake did not vary
   between seasons, implying that nutrient requirements are met throughout
   the year. These results suggest we draw more conservative conclusions
   when interpreting dietary variability in the absence of chemical
   analysis, and also draw into question the idea that nutritional stress
   is a factor in the timing of reproduction in lemurs and, by extension,
   is linked to the prevalence of female dominance and small group size in
   lemurs. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Habitat fragmentation inhibits gene flow between populations often
   resulting in a loss of genetic diversity with possible negative effects
   on fitness parameters. In vertebrates, growing evidence suggests that
   such genetic diversity is particularly important at the level of the
   major histocompatibility complex (MHC) because its gene products play an
   important role in immune functions. Diversity in the MHC is assumed to
   improve population viability. Here, we investigated the impact of forest
   fragmentation on the genetic variability of one of the functionally
   important parts of the MHC, DRB exon 2, of the endemic mouse lemur
   Microcebus murinus by comparing populations inhabiting two littoral
   forest fragments of different size in southeastern Madagascar. Twelve
   different alleles of DRB exon 2 were found in 145 individuals of M.
   murinus with high levels of sequence divergence between alleles. In both
   subpopulations, levels of genetic diversity were high, and the genetic
   analyses revealed only limited effects of fragmentation. Significantly
   more non-synonymous than synonymous substitutions were found in the
   functionally important antigen recognition and binding sites indicating
   selection processes maintaining MHC polymorphism. This is the first
   study on MHC variation in a free-ranging Malagasy lemur population.},

   for the choice of the smaller array), six of the 10 subjects overcame
   their side bias and learned to select the smaller array. When a
   correction procedure was added, all the remaining subjects mastered the
   task. Performance was maintained when the original reverse-reward
   contingency was rerun, and when novel array pairs were presented.
   Several months after the study, six subjects retained a significant

Abstract = {Evolutionary relationships of different populations of the threatened
   malagasy lemur Lepilemur septentrimialis were assessed by sequence
   analysis of mitochondrial DNA (D-loop region and partial Cyt b gene).
   One hundred and fifty nine samples were collected from five main
   different localities in the northern part of Madagascar. We applied the
   phylogenetic species concept based on fixed diagnostic differences to
   determine the status of different geographical populations. No
   nucleotide site diagnoses Ankarana from Andrafiamena or Analamera.
   However, numerous fixed differences separate Sahafary from all other
   populations. These results were corroborated by phylogenetic trees. As
   previous cytogenetic studies, our molecular data suggest that two
   cryptic species of Lepilemur occur in the extreme north of Madagascar.
   This speciation is probably caused by chromosomal rearrangements in at
   least one of the evolutionary lineages. Our study comprises another
   striking example of how molecular genetic assay can detect phylogenetic
   discontinuities that are not reflected in traditional morphologically
   based taxonomies. Our study indicates that the Sahafary population is a
   hitherto undescribed endangered endemic species which urgently needs

Title = {Seasonal variation in body mass and locomotor kinetics of the fat-tailed
   dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY},

Volume = {260},
Number = {1},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius) is unusual among
   primates in storing large amounts of fat subcutaneously prior to
   hibernating during the winter months. In doing so, it increases its body
   mass by more than 50\%, with a substantial weight gain in the tail. This
   seasonal increase in mass provides a unique natural experiment to
   examine how changes in body mass affect substrate reaction forces during
   locomotion. As body mass increases, it is expected that the limbs of the
   fat-tailed dwarf lemur will be subjected to greater peak vertical
   substrate reaction forces during quadrupedal walking. However, whether
   or not these peak substrate reaction forces will increase proportionally
   across forelimbs and hindlimbs as body mass increases is unknown.
   Substrate reaction forces were collected on four adult C. medius walking
   quadrupedally on a 28-mm pole attached to a force platform. Peak
   vertical substrate reaction forces (V-pk) (N) were analyzed and compared
   for a cross-sectional sample of different body masses (180-300 g).
   Forelimb and hindlimb V-pk were positively correlated with body mass,
   with hindlimb V-pk always higher than forelimb V-pk. However, the rate
   at which V-pk increased relative to body mass was higher for the
   hindlimb than the forelimb. This disproportion in weight distribution
   between the forelimbs and hindlimbs as body mass increases appears to be
   linked to the accumulation of fat in the tail. It is likely that storing
   fat in the tail region may shift the center of mass more caudally, from
   a more cranial position when the tail is thinner. Such a caudal shift of
   the center of mass-either morphological or dynamic-is believed to have
   played an important role in the functional differentiation of the limbs
   and the evolution of locomotor modes of several tetrapod groups,
   including dinosaurs and primates. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   captive-bred black and white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata variegata)
   into the Betampona Reserve in eastern Madagascar. The release programme
   has three major aims: (1) to assess the ability of captive-bred V. v.
   variegata to adapt to life in their natural habitat; (2) to investigate
   the contribution that such a release programme can make to reinforcing
   the existing small wild population of V. v. variegata in Betampona; and
   (3) to contribute to the long-term protection and conservation of the
   reserve. Criteria for the selection of release candidates, veterinary
   screening and pre-release experience in naturalistic environments are
   described and discussed. Methods for post-release monitoring of health
   and behaviour are covered in detail. The importance of considering the
   social dynamics of the species involved is emphasised. The survival of
   five of the releasees, plus successful reproduction and integration with
   the wild population have led to the conclusion that the release was a

Abstract = {In group-living species, theoretical considerations indicate the
   existence of a fundamental conflict of interest between the sexes over
   the adult sex ratio within groups. Females may derive certain benefits
   from living with many males. Males, in contrast, should generally try to
   monopolize access to a group of females. Which sex ultimately controls
   adult group sex ratio is poorly known. We examined this conflict between
   the sexes in redfronted lemurs, Malagasy primates characterized by an
   unusual lack of female-biased adult sex ratios. Using various
   demographic and behavioural data from several groups collected over 6
   years, we examined (1) the proximate determinants of this unusual sex
   ratio, (2) the temporal distribution of female fertile phases within
   groups as a determinant of male monopolization potential, (3) sources of
   between-group variation in the adult sex ratio, and (4) possible social
   benefits of the relatively high number of males for both sexes. Birth
   and mortality rates were not sex biased and males migrated considerably
   more frequently than females, providing no proximate explanation for the
   unusual sex ratio. However, certain life history traits (fast
   maturation, short interbirth intervals) may ultimately play a role
   because they act to facilitate joint group transfers of male coalitions.
   Despite a relatively small female group size and an associated high
   monopolization potential, female oestrous synchrony may prevent the
   formation of single-male groups. Reduced male group size seems to be the
   main predictor of take-over rate, and, thus, infanticide risk,
   suggesting that both sexes may benefit from the high number of
   coresident males, thereby considerably defusing the conflict of interest
   between the sexes. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {Hemochromatosis was diagnosed in a 14-year-old, male, red ruffed lemur
   (Varecia variegata ruber) on the basis of abnormal results of serum
   biochemical analysis, including high serum ferritin and transferrin
   saturation values, and of liver biopsy. Therapy included chelation,
   using desferoxamine to remove excess iron and S-adenosylmethionine to
   improve liver function, and monthly peripheral blood removal by
   phlebotomy to reduce total body iron content. Response to treatment was
   assessed by changes in the lemur's attitude and appetite, as well as
   variations in serum biochemical and iron panel values. Initial
   improvement was associated with the onset of therapy. After 56 days of
   treatment, results of serum biochemical analysis indicated a decrease in
   iron panel values Treatment was temporarily discontinued from days 56 to
   65, and the lemur's condition worsened, so therapy was re-instituted.
   However, the lemur died of hepatocellular carcinoma on day 110 of
   treatment.},

Abstract = {Age-related regional cerebral atrophy was evaluated in a small
   lissencephalic primate, model of cerebral aging. Twelve mouse lemurs
   (Microcebus murinus), ages 1.9-10.9 years (maximum life span: 12 years),
   were studied. 313 inversion-recovery fast spin-echo MR images (isotropic
   resolution = 234 mum) were recorded at 4.7 T with a surface coil
   actively decoupled from the transmitting birdcage probe. The surface
   coil-related sensitivity gradient was corrected by normalization with
   images from an agar and NaCl phantom. An automatic statistical
   segmentation technique based on a classification-maximization algorithm
   was tested on digital phantoms that mimicked the brain and applied to
   the 3D brain images. Segmented 3D maps that displayed gray matter, white
   matter, and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) voxels were computed. The
   ventricles and peri-encephalic spaces were categorized into 14 regions,
   defined on brain atlases on the basis of cytoarchitectural and
   anatomical criteria. The volume of CSF voxels belonging to each of these
   regions was calculated as an index of regional atrophy. Dilation of the
   mammillary fossa was an early event in the aging process. CSF
   accumulation within the occipital, parieto-temporal, temporal, and
   frontal ventral peri-encephalic spaces was particularly marked in the
   oldest animals that also displayed ophthalmologic alterations. (C) 2003

Abstract = {Differential access to food resources is thought to be the main
   determinant of differences in female reproductive success but is poorly
   studied in both pair-living and nocturnal primates. The modes of food
   competition within and between families were investigated following the
   principles proposed by the `ecological model' using 3 years of field
   data from seven fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer) families. The major
   food resources were identified from year-round feeding observations and
   the strength and mode of competition were inferred from differences in
   physical condition. The most important food resource of fork-marked
   lemurs were tree exudates which occurred in small, defendable food
   patches, characterized by fast depletion and rapid renewal. These
   characteristics led to strong within-group contest and scramble
   competition, which were found to yield a positive dominance effect and a
   negative group-size effect on female net energy gain. Differential
   physical condition, however, did not translate directly into
   differential reproductive success. Low female fertility was best
   predicted by large family size associated with delayed dispersal by
   previous offspring. Although there is no obvious benefit from full-grown
   offspring in their territory, adults tolerate delayed natal dispersal,
   probably because dispersal poses extraordinary costs for the offspring.
   These costs are likely to accrue from decreased foraging efficiency in
   unfamiliar habitats because exudate feeding requires very rigid feeding
   itineraries. In conclusion, the presented evidence for group-size
   effects on reproductive success in pair-living females opens a new area
   for research on the costs and benefits of delayed dispersal and female
   reproductive decisions.},

Abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes have complicated
   and profound evolutionary histories. To reconstruct and better
   understand their histories, partial class I genes (exon 2-intron 2-exon
   3) were sequenced in a sampling of prosimians (Strepsirhini, Primates).
   In total, we detected 117 different sequences from 36 Malagasy
   prosimians (lemurs) and 1 non-Malagasy prosimian (galago) representing 4
   families, 7 genera, and 13 species. Unlike the MHC class II genes
   (MHC-DRB), MHC class I genes show a generally genus-specific mode of
   evolution in lemurs. Additionally, no prosimian class I loci were found
   to be orthologous to HLA genes, even at highly conserved loci (such as
   HLA-E, HLA-F). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that nucleotide diversity
   among loci was very small and the persistence time of the polymorphisms
   was short, suggesting that the origin of the lemur MHC class I genes
   detected in this study was relatively recent. The evolutionary mode of
   these genes is similar to that of classic HLA genes, HLA-A, HLA-B, and
   HLA-C, in terms of their recent origin and rarity of pseudogenes, and
   differs from them with respect to the degree of gene duplications. From
   the viewpoint of MHC genes evolution, some interlocus sequence exchanges
   were apparently observed in the lemur lineage upon phylogenetic and
   amino acid motif analyses. This is also in contrast to the evolutionary
   mode of HLA genes, where intralocus exchanges have certainly occurred
   but few interlocus exchanges have taken place. Consequently, the gene
   conversion model for explaining the generation of the MHC diversity
   among different loci can be thought to play more important roles in the
   evolution of lemur MHC class I genes than in that of HLA genes.},

Title = {Comparison of likelihood and Bayesian methods for estimating divergence
   times using multiple gene loci and calibration points, with application
   to a radiation of cute-looking mouse lemur species},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {52},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Divergence time and substitution rate are seriously confounded in
   phylogenetic analysis, making it difficult to estimate divergence times
   when the molecular clock (rate constancy among lineages) is violated.
   This problem can be alleviated to some extent by analyzing multiple gene
   loci simultaneously and by using multiple calibration points. While
   different genes may have different patterns of evolutionary rate change,
   they share the same divergence times. Indeed, the fact that each gene
   may violate the molecular clock differently leads to the advantage of
   simultaneous analysis of multiple loci. Multiple calibration points
   provide the means for characterizing the local evolutionary rates on the
   phylogeny. In this paper, we extend previous likelihood models of local
   molecular clock for estimating species divergence times to accommodate
   multiple calibration points and multiple genes. Heterogeneity among
   different genes in evolutionary rate and in substitution process is
   accounted for by the models. We apply the likelihood models to analyze
   two mitochondrial protein-coding genes, cytochrome oxidase II and
   cytochrome b, to estimate divergence times of Malagasy mouse lemurs and
   related outgroups. The likelihood method is compared with the Bayes
   method of Thorne et al. (1998, Mol. Biol. Evol. 15: 1647-1657), which
   uses a probabilistic model to describe the change in evolutionary rate
   over time and uses the Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure to derive the
   posterior distribution of rates and times. Our likelihood implementation
   has the drawbacks of failing to accommodate uncertainties in fossil
   calibrations and of requiring the researcher to classify branches on the
   tree into different rate groups. Both problems are avoided in the Bayes
   method. Despite the differences in the two methods, however, data
   partitions and model assumptions had the greatest impact on date
   estimation. The three codon positions have very different substitution
   rates and evolutionary dynamics, and assumptions in the substitution
   model affect date estimation in both likelihood and Bayes analyses. The
   results demonstrate that the separate analysis is unreliable, with dates
   variable among codon positions and between methods, and that the
   combined analysis is much more reliable. When the three codon positions
   were analyzed simultaneously under the most realistic models using all
   available calibration information, the two methods produced similar
   results. The divergence of the mouse lemurs is dated to be around 7-10
   million years ago, indicating a surprisingly early species radiation for
   such a morphologically uniform group of primates.},

Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {631-642},

Abstract = {A second specimen of the basal therapsid Lemurosaurus pricei preserves
   aspects of this taxon's cranial anatomy, such as the structure of the
   temporal region, palate, and lower jaw, that were either unknown or
   poorly preserved in the holotype. Although typically considered a
   dinocephalian feature, intermeshing of the incisors is confirmed for
   Lemurosaurus. Autapomorphies of the genus include a nubbin-like boss at
   the apex of the lateral temporal fenestra, the presence of very coarse
   serrations on the posterior margins of the upper postcanine teeth, and
   the low, ridge-like form of the median frontal crest.
   The anatomical data provided by the new Lemurosaurus specimen permits
   the first cladistic appraisal of its phylogenetic position among
   biarmosuchian therapsids. A cladistic analysis of 10 therapsids, two
   outgroups, and 38 characters indicates that Lemurosaurus is the sister
   taxon to a clade including Bullocephalus, Proburnetia, and Burnetia.
   Taxonomically, this position implies the reclassification of
   Lemurosaurus as a basal burnetiamorph, rather than as an ictidorhinid.
   Biogeographically, the position of Lemurosaurus makes it most
   parsimonious to infer that burnetiamorphs originated in southern Africa,
   although this hypothesis ignores potential sampling biases.},

Abstract = {Gross and histologic aspects of facial expression muscles are presented
   here for Otolemur spp. (suborder Prosimii, family Lorisidae) and are
   compared with those of lemuroids. Muscles of facial expression are
   involved in social signaling among primates, and are a primary means by
   which close-proximity nonverbal communication is achieved. These muscles
   have been well described in catarrhines and many of the lemuroids;
   however, their arrangement is not well known in the lorisids. In the
   present study we examined muscles of facial expression in Otolemur by
   dissecting preserved faces. The arrangement and appearance of the
   muscles were noted, and samples were gathered from each muscle for
   histologic processing. The results showed 17 muscles of facial
   expression in Otolemur, as compared to seven reported in previous
   studies. Histologically, muscles of the ear region were arranged in
   tight, dense fascicles, while muscles of the orbital region were
   arranged more loosely. Grossly, the facial expression muscles in
   Otolemur were very similar in morphology and attachments to those in the
   lemuroids, with some differences in the ear region. Otolemur garnettii
   had several muscles that appeared to be more robust than in the larger
   O. crassicaudatus. This may be due to dietary and/or social differences
   between the species. In previous studies it was concluded that, relative
   to lemuroids, Otolemur has a primitive arrangement of facial expression
   muscles. The current results do not support that conclusion, and in fact
   support a far greater similarity between Otolemur and lemuroids in
   general. These results underscore the need for a reexamination of facial
   musculature in prosimians in general, and may have taxonomic value as
   regards the position of Otolernur with lemuroids and other galagos. (C)

Abstract = {Short-day-induced fattening was investigated in the small nocturnal
   primate Microcebus murinus. Animals were either transferred from long
   photoperiod (LP) to short photoperiod (SP) or maintained in LP and
   submitted to various treatments. Animals fed daily on 40 mug of
   melatonin (MEL) at two different times showed a significant increase in
   body mass compared to LP-exposed animals. This weight gain was more
   marked in animals fed with MEL 2 h before night onset, suggesting a
   critical period around the first hours of the night. The MEL-induced
   fattening was associated with an increase in food intake and a decrease
   in plasma thyroxin (T4) levels. On the other hand, a decrease in T4
   plasma levels induced by two doses of methimazole (MET) led to either an
   increase (3 mg/day) or a decrease (10 mg/day) of body mass, suggesting a
   role of thyroid hormones in the photoperiodic regulation of body mass.
   The MET-induced fattening did not involve any change in food intake.
   These findings suggest that autumn fattening in the gray mouse lemur
   proceeds from two distinct mechanisms. First, an increase of food intake
   may result in the SP-induced increase in MEL secretion. Second, a
   decrease of energy expenditure may be due to the MEL-induced
   hypothyroidism. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {This study of two lemur species (Lemur catta and Propithecus v.
   verreauxi) in Madagascar combines observations of food procurement and
   initial food placement in the mouth with comparisons to food toughness
   and external properties. Food toughness was hypothesized to play a
   decisive role in determining food placement during ingestion. It was
   found that tougher foods are generally ingested on the postcanines for
   all foods eaten. However, when leaves and fruits are analyzed
   separately, food size and shape, represented here by mass and food type,
   are more reliable predictors of initial food placement. Larger leaves'
   and bulkier fruits and stalks are ingested posteriorly. Leaf toughness
   is not related to leaf size, though the toughness and size of the most
   commonly eaten fruits are correlated. Furthermore, ingestive food
   toughness, which is the maximum toughness, and ``average{''} food
   toughness may make different mechanical demands on the masticatory
   apparatus that have consequences for jaw morphology. (C) 2003

Abstract = {The lemurs of Madagascar provide an excellent model for exploring
   evolutionary diversification. This study investigates genetic divergence
   among most extant lemur taxa in relation to potential geographical
   boundaries to gene flow. For this purpose, approximate to 2,400 by of
   mitochondrial DNA (part of the COIII gene; ND3, ND4L, and ND4 genes; and
   five tRNAs) were sequenced in a total of 131 lemurs from 5 families, 12
   genera, 25 species, and 18 subspecies to reconstruct phylogenetic
   relationships among them. The comprehensive range of taxa makes this a
   particularly suitable molecular data set to examine lemur evolution.
   Those data clearly reveal that the Betsiboka River acts as an isolating
   barrier between populations of lemurs in north-western Madagascar. The
   Tsiribihina River similarly serves as a barrier to gene flow between
   northern and southern populations of lemurs in central western
   Madagascar, whereas the Mahavavy River does not seem to lead to genetic
   isolation of lemur populations. Several discrepancies among molecular
   data, current taxonomy, and geographic distribution along the western
   coast emerged. Examination of geographical distribution of the taxa
   concerned in comparison with distribution boundaries of other lemur taxa
   in that region yielded explanations for these inconsistencies. Eulemur
   fulvus and Eulemur mongoz are the only lemur taxa that also occur
   outside Madagascar, on the Comoro Islands. Genetic data show no
   significant differentiation between Malagasy and Comorian populations of
   these species, supporting the interpretation that both were introduced
   only recently to the Comoro Islands.},

Abstract = {We examined predictions on the proportion of dispersing natal males and
   females, dispersal distances, the age at dispersal and the potential for
   inbreeding over a 6-year period in a free-living population of grey
   mouse lemurs. We used monthly mark-recapture procedures to determine
   individual locations and interindividual distances. The analysis of
   seven polymorphic microsatellite markers for 213 (130 males, 83 females)
   individuals allowed us to estimate relatedness coefficients and kinship
   relationships. Closely related males ranged further from each other than
   closely related females and natal males were found further from their
   potential mothers than were females. Natal males were more likely to
   disperse from their birth sites than females, although male dispersal
   was not universal. Male breeding dispersal was detected in half of the
   long-term observations. Males therefore seem to be the predominant
   vectors for gene flow between populations and social units. Females
   usually stayed within one to two home range diameters of their potential
   mother, facilitating the evolution of cooperative behaviour by kin
   selection among females. Most dispersal took place before the mating
   season, indicating an age of less than 7 months for natal dispersal. The
   analysis of spatiotemporal coexistence revealed the potential for
   inbreeding in only 3.8\% of the potential mother-son dyads, but in
   21.9\% of the potential father-daughter dyads and in 41.7\% of other
   closely related male-female dyads. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {We investigated the sleeping site ecology of two sympatric mouse lemur
   species (Microcebus murinus and M. ravelobensis) in northwestern
   Madagascar during the second half of the dry season with respect to the
   type, quality, and usage pattern of the sleeping sites, as well as to
   social sleeping habits and response to potential threats. The type and
   quality of the sleeping sites differed between the two species. M.
   murinus used protected wooden shelters (tree holes) more frequently than
   M. ravelobensis, and M. ravelobensis used a broader variety of less
   protected sites (e.g., branches, lianas, and leaves) than M. murinus.
   Whereas male M. murinus usually slept alone, and female M. murinus
   mostly slept in groups, both sexes of M. ravelobensis slept in mixed-sex
   sleeping groups. M. murinus relied on crypsis in their sleeping sites,
   whereas M. ravelobensis regularly showed a flight response to the
   approach of an observer. This behavioral difference could indicate an
   adaptation to a higher predation risk in less protected sleeping sites.
   Whereas female M. murinus showed a high site fidelity, male M. murinus
   and both sexes of M. ravelobensis frequently changed their sleeping
   sites, which may also be interpreted as an antipredator strategy. The
   results are discussed with respect to three possible ecological
   explanations: interspecies competition, restricted resource
   availability, and niche differentiation. The latter is the most likely
   explanation for these interspecific differences.},

Abstract = {The gray mouse lemur Microcebus murinus is a rare example of a primate
   exhibiting daily torpor. In captive animals, we examined the metabolic
   rate during arousal from torpor and showed that this process involved
   nonshivering thermogenesis (NST). Under thermoneutrality (28degrees C),
   warming-up from daily torpor (body temperature <33 degrees C) involved a
   rapid (<5 min) increase of O-2 consumption that was proportional to the
   depth of torpor (n = 8). The injection of a beta-adrenergic agonist
   (isoproterenol) known to elicit NST induced a dose-dependent increase in
   metabolic rate (n = 8). Moreover, maximum thermogenesis was increased by
   cold exposure. For the first time in this species, anatomic and
   histological examination using an antibody against uncoupling protein
   (UCP) specifically demonstrated the presence of brown fat. With the use
   of Western blotting with the same antibody, we showed a likely increase
   in UCP expression after cold exposure, suggesting that NST is also used
   to survive low ambient temperatures in this tropical species.},

Abstract = {Conceptions in mammals may depend on a variety of factors including mate
   familiarity, age, sociosexual experience and female mate choice. We
   tested predictions for the effects of these factors on pregnancies in a
   captive colony of grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). The succession
   of oestrous cycles and pregnancies was analysed for a total of 26
   different females that were housed together with 33 different males over
   a total of 124 oestrous cycles between 1995 and 2001. In addition,
   sexual behaviours were recorded and analysed over 13 oestrous cycles of
   9 different females. An effect of mate familiarity on pregnancies could
   be detected by a frequent delay of pregnancies to the second cycle of
   the season (66.7\% of the possible cases). Female age influenced
   pregnancies as the 2-3-year old females were less likely to become
   pregnant than females of other age classes. This reduced rate of
   pregnancies, however, was probably due to the lack of previous
   sociosexual experience with males. Females that have not been housed
   with males within their first reproductive season, needed one or two
   years of sociosexual experience before their first successful
   impregnation. These findings are discussed as a side effect of the
   ontogenetic development of female dominance. Female mate choice could be
   deduced from the succession of pregnancies and the strong responsibility
   of the females for the termination of matings.},

Abstract = {In temperate species, hibernation is enhanced by high levels of
   essential fatty acids in white adipose tissue. Essential fatty acids
   cannot be synthesized by mammals, thus nutritional ecology should play a
   key role in physiological adaptations to hibernation. Tropical
   hibernators are exposed to different physiological demands than
   hibernators in temperate regions and are expected to be subject to
   different constraints. The aims of this study were to assess whether or
   not the tropical hibernator Cheirogaleus medius shows biochemical
   changes in its white adipose tissue before and during hibernation. A
   capture-recapture study was combined with feeding observations in
   western Madagascar. Before and after hibernation, 77 samples of white
   adipose tissue from 57 individuals of C. medius, as well as dietary
   items eaten during pre-hibernation fattening, were sampled and analyzed
   for their fatty acid composition. In contrast to temperate hibernators,
   C. medius exhibits extremely low essential fatty acid concentrations in
   its white adipose tissue (2.5\%) prior to hibernation. The fatty acid
   pattern of the white adipose tissue did not change during
   pre-hibernation fattening and did not reflect dietary fatty acid
   composition. During hibernation, fat stores showed only minor but
   significant compositional changes. Because of its prevalence, the main
   fuel during hibernation was the monounsaturated oleic acid, which seemed
   to be preferentially synthesized from dietary carbohydrates. Results
   suggest that essential fatty acids do not represent an ecological
   limitation for hibernation in the tropics, at least not in the
   fat-tailed dwarf lemur.},

Abstract = {Understanding processes affecting the distribution and abundance of
   organisms is a central issue in ecology and conservation biology. In
   northwestern Madagascar, we found an uneven distribution pattern of the
   golden-brown mouse lemur (Microcebus ravelobensis) and the grey mouse
   lemur (M. murinus). In one area (JBA) the two species lived
   sympatrically, whereas in another forest area (JBB) Microcebus
   ravelobensis occurred exclusively. To investigate whether differences in
   forest structure may explain this uneven distribution, we conducted a
   microhabitat analysis and related it to specific distribution. In JBA
   the habitat of Microcebus ravelobensis was characterized by a higher
   percentage of trees with many lianas and a higher cover of the herb
   layer, whereas that of M. murinus had a higher number of trees with a
   diameter at breast height (DBH)>10 cm. The comparison of the forest
   structure of the microhabitats of the two species between JBA and JBB
   revealed further differences The cover of the overstory, the percentage
   of trees without lianas and the number of larger trees (DBH >10 cm)
   among the microhabitats were higher for Microcebus murinus in JBA than
   for M. ravelobensis in JBB whereas the microhabitats of M. ravelobensis
   at the two sites did not differ concerning these vegetation structures
   Differences between the two species coincide with those of resources
   important for survival. Our results indicate the importance of
   microhabitat analyses for the understanding of distribution patterns of
   species and for successful conservation planning.},

Abstract = {Among pair-living species, which represent a simple form of
   gregariousness, the degree of cohesion appears to be highly variable,
   but the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of cohesiveness have
   been poorly studied. We present data from long-term behavioural
   observations of eight pairs of fork-marked lemurs, including year-round
   data on their sleeping site use and spatial data from simultaneous focal
   follows of both pair partners, that characterize its social organization
   as `dispersed pairs'. Although pairs were stable over several years,
   territories of pair partners overlapped almost perfectly and
   interactions between them were frequent, the cohesiveness of pairs was
   extremely low. High rates of conflict relative to frequencies of
   affiliative interactions indicated that avoidance of the pair partner is
   the key mechanism responsible for the observed pattern of space use. The
   repeated use of the same predictable food resources during the night,
   frequent conflicts over food and patterns of vocal communication imply
   that avoidance of direct feeding competition, together with incomplete
   knowledge about the pair partner's position, lead to the observed low
   cohesiveness. The freedom to forage solitarily and the associated lack
   of information about the pair partner's position found in fork-marked
   lemurs are in contrast to most group-living species and qualify
   dispersed pairs as a focus for future studies. of models on animal

Title = {Female dominance status and fecal corticoids in a cooperative breeder
   with low reproductive skew: ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)},
Journal = {HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many studies have shown that low dominance status within a social group
   is associated with elevated glucocorticoid hormone production, a common
   index of physiological stress. However, the reverse may be true among
   cooperatively breeding female mammals with high reproductive skew; that
   is, high dominance status is associated with elevated glucocorticoid
   levels. Elevated glucocorticoid levels in these dominant females may be
   a product of their being the only breeder within a group or may result
   from other challenges associated with high status. To test this
   difference, we studied fecal corticoid levels in cooperative breeding
   females with low reproductive skew (i.e., where reproduction is not
   limited to dominant group members): ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). We
   collected behavioral and fecal corticoid data from 39 ring-tailed lemur
   females from eight groups across three sites. In seven of the eight
   groups, either one or both of the two most dominant females (ranks 1 and
   2) exhibited the highest fecal corticoid levels in the groups. The best
   predictor of corticoid levels in high-ranking females was the proportion
   of aggressive agonistic interactions they initiated. For the
   lower-ranking females the best predictors of elevated corticoid levels
   were being the recipient of aggressive attacks and being relatively
   close to one's nearest neighbors. These results differ from many studies
   of caged male mammals where subordinate individuals often exhibit the
   highest glucocorticoid levels of a group. Furthermore, the results
   indicate that reproduction itself is not the primary reason for higher
   glucocorticoid levels among dominant cooperative-breeding females, but
   that some other factor must account for these elevated levels. (C) 2003

Abstract = {Due to their higher reproductive investment, female mammals are usually
   more dependent on food than males. In a dry deciduous forest of western
   Madagascar, body mass, spacing patterns, feeding and social behaviour of
   Grey Mouse Lemurs (Schmid \& Kappeler, 1998) were investigated during
   the autumn fattening phase (March-April) using mark-recapture and
   behavioral observations. Only a few animals (23\%) increased their body
   mass, and females were generally heavier than males. The spatial
   distribution of captures of both males and females followed the
   distribution of gum trees, which appeared as a keystone resource at this
   period (about 75\% of the diet). Moreover, females trapped near gum
   trees were significantly heavier than others, whereas no such difference
   was observed in males. Spatial exclusion was noted between male and
   female capture locations. Local resource competition, confirmed by
   behavioural observations, may have led to higher body mass in dominant
   animals, and especially in females. Storage of fat may affect survival
   during the dry season and reproductive success at the ensuing rainy
   season. Therefore, feeding competition, by resulting in high inter- and
   intrasexual differences in fattening and use of space, may have
   implications for dynamics of populations and social organization.},

Abstract = {A panel of human chromosome painting probes and bacterial and PI
   artificial chromosome (BAC/PAC) clones were used in fluorescence in situ
   hybridization (FISH) experiments to investigate the chromosome
   conservation of the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta, LCA) with respect to
   human. Whole chromosome paints specific for human chromosomes 7, 9, 11,
   13, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, and X were found to identify a single chromosome
   or an uninterrupted chromosomal region in LCA. A large set of partial
   chromosome paints and BAC/PAC probes were then used to refine the
   characterization of the rearrangements differentiating the two
   karyotypes. The results were also used to reconstruct the ancestral
   Lemuridae karyotype. Lemur catta, indeed, can be used as an outgroup,
   allowing symplesiomorphic (ancestral) rearrangements to be distinguished
   from apomorphic (derived) rearrangements in lemurs. Some LCA chromosomes
   are difficult to distinguish morphologically. The `anchorage' of most
   LCA chromosomes to specific probes will contribute to the
   standardization of the karyotype of this species.},

Abstract = {Recent morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies of mouse lemurs

   have shown that specific diversity had been considerably underestimated.
   In large part, this underestimate was due to the lack of sufficient
   specimens from given localities to assess properly the level of
   phenotypic variation within and between populations. The accurate
   delineation of specific boundaries has no doubt been confounded by the
   diminutive size, nocturnal habits, and subtle morphological variation
   characteristic of mouse lemurs, which can make field identification of
   individuals problematic. We illustrate the use of molecular phylogenetic
   analysis to reveal reproductive isolation in two sympatric mouse lemur
   species, Microcebus murinus and M. griseorufus. Their documentation in
   the Berenty Private Reserve in the extreme south of Madagascar verifies
   the historically-broad distribution of Microcebus griseorufus, a species

Abstract = {We examined genetic consequences of basic predictions of life history
   and sexual selection theory in a wild population of redfronted lemurs.
   Because group living in lemurs evolved independently from other
   primates, and because polygynous lemurs deviate in several sexually
   selected traits from theoretical predictions, data on genetic correlates
   of their social and mating systems can make important contributions to
   studies of convergence in social evolution, but such data are not
   available from wild populations. We extracted DNA from tissue samples
   obtained from 59 animals living in Kirindy forest, Madagascar, and
   examined individual variability at several microsatellite loci and the
   mitochondrial D-loop. We found that closely related females of a single
   matriline formed the core of the four main study groups. Virtually all
   haplotypes of adult males differed from those of coresident females, and
   many male haplotypes were represented by only one or two individuals.
   Paternity analyses for infants from groups with detailed behavioural
   data revealed that a disproportionate share of infants were sired by the
   central, dominant male of a group, despite promiscuous mating.
   Extragroup paternities were not detected. The skew in male reproductive
   success cannot be reconciled with the lack of sexual dimorphism and the
   even adult sex ratios. We therefore conclude that these group-living
   lemurs converge with many other primates in sex-specific life history
   trajectories, including female philopatry and male dispersal, but that
   the observed skew in male reproductive success makes the apparent lack
   of adaptation to intrasexual selection in certain behavioural;
   demographic and morphological traits even more puzzling. (C) 2002 The

Abstract = {Kin selection affects many aspects of social behaviour, especially in
   gregarious animals in which relatives are permanently associated. In
   most group-living primates with complex social behaviour, females are
   philopatric and organized into matrilines. Models of primate social
   evolution assume that females in solitary primates are also organized
   into matrilines. We examined the genetic structure and the mating system
   of a population of Coquerel's dwarf lemur (Mirza coquereli), a solitary
   primate from Madagascar, to test this assumption. Our genetic and
   behavioural analyses revealed that this population of solitary
   individuals is indeed structured into matrilines, even though this
   pattern was not predicted by behavioural data. Specifically, females
   sharing a mitochondrial DNA haplotype were significantly clustered in
   space and the average genetic and geographical distances among them were
   negatively correlated. Not all females were philopatric, but there is no
   evidence for the successful settlement of dispersing females. Although
   not all adult males dispersed from their natal range, they were not
   significantly clustered in space and all of them roamed widely in search
   of oestrous females. As a result, paternity was widely spread among
   males and mixed paternities existed, indicating that scramble
   competition polygyny is the mating system of this species. Our data
   therefore revealed facultative dispersal in both sexes with a strong
   bias towards female philopatry in this primitive primate. We further
   conclude that complex kinship structures also exist in non-gregarious
   species, where their consequences for social behaviour are not obvious.},

Title = {Responses of redfronted lemurs to experimentally modified alarm calls:
   Evidence for urgency-based changes in call structure},

Year = {2002},
Volume = {108},
Number = {9},
Pages = {763-777},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate how information about the
   affective state is expressed in vocalizations. Alarm calls can serve as
   model systems with which to study this general question. Therefore, we
   examined the information content of terrestrial predator alarm calls of
   redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus ), group-living Malagasy
   primates. Redfronted lemurs give specific alarm calls only towards
   raptors, whereas calls given in response to terrestrial predators
   (woofs) are also used in other situations characterized by high arousal.
   Woofs may therefore have the potential to express the perceived risk of
   a given threat. In order to examine whether different levels of arousal
   are expressed in call structure, we analysed woofs given during
   inter-group encounters or in response to playbacks of a barking dog,
   assuming that animals engaged in inter-group encounters experience
   higher arousal than during the playbacks of dog barks. A multivariate
   acoustic analysis revealed that calls given during group encounters were
   characterized by higher frequencies than calls given in response to
   playbacks of dog barks. In order to examine whether this change in call
   structure is salient to conspecifics, we conducted playback experiments
   with woofs, modified in either amplitude or frequencies. Playbacks of
   calls with increased frequency or amplitude elicited a longer orienting
   response, suggesting that different levels of arousal are expressed in
   call structure and provide meaningful information for listeners. In
   conclusion, the results of our study indicate that the information about
   the sender's affective state is expressed in the structure of
   vocalizations.},

Abstract = {Group composition and mating system were investigated in wild Alaotran
   gentle lemurs (Hapalemur griseus alaotrensis) using genetic markers.
   These small-bodied herbivorous and cathemeral primates are endemic to
   the reed and papyrus beds around Lac Alaotra in Madagascar. They live in
   small groups in small, defended territories. Data were collected during
   the rainy seasons in 1996, 1997, and 1999, and include 99 individuals
   from 22 neighboring social groups and an additional 30 animals from
   other areas representing most of the geographic range. Animals were
   located by researchers canoeing in the marshes bordering the lake. After
   a group's size was determined by direct observation, all individuals
   were captured, marked, and released. During handling each individual was
   weighed and sexed, and hair samples for DNA extraction were collected. A
   342 bp mtDNA control region sequence and 10 nuclear microsatellite loci
   provided multilocus genotypes that were used to assess pedigree
   relations and population structure. Alaotran gentle lemurs were found in
   groups of two to nine individuals (mean: 4.3), comprising one or two
   breeding females, their offspring, and one reproducing male. Solitary
   individuals of both sexes were encountered rarely. Breeding females were
   the permanent core of the social groups, whereas intergroup transfer of
   reproductive males was relatively frequent. Forty percent of all
   reproducing groups contained two breeding females, which were related to
   each other as closely as mother-daughter or full sisters. Parentage
   assessment revealed a variable mating system ranging from serial
   monogamy to polygyny within social groups. At least 8\% of paternities
   involved extragroup males. Additional data on life history and
   reproduction are presented, and the social system of the Alaotran gentle
   lemur is discussed in the light of the new genetic findings. (C) 2002

Abstract = {Aotus lemurinus griseimembra is considered one of the best nonhuman
   primate species for malarial studies because of its susceptibility to
   infection by Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood stages. However,
   reproducible transmission of infective P. falciparum sporozoites by
   mosquito inoculation has been difficult to achieve even in
   splenectomized monkeys. Characterization of an Aotus-P. falciparum
   cyclical transmission model has become a top priority as a result of the
   significant progress toward the development of preerythrocytic malaria
   vaccines. Herein, we describe a reproducible model developed using
   intact A. lemurinus griseimembra monkeys intravenously inoculated with
   sporozoites from a monkey-adapted P. falciparum (Santa Lucia) strain and
   a wild Falciparum-Cali-Colombia-4 (FCC-4) strain. Sporozoites were
   obtained by salivary gland dissection of laboratory-reared Anopheles
   albimanus mosquitoes. Parasitemia was monitored by thick-smear
   microscopy, parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) determination, and
   mosquito xenodiagnosis. The last method proved to be the most sensitive
   method for monitoring parasitemias. Infection with the Santa Lucia
   strain showed a mean prepatent period of 16 days (range 6-21 days),
   whereas infection with the wild FCC-4 strain resulted in a 24-day
   prepatent period. Mean peak parasite density was approximately 900
   parasites/mul for both parasite strains. The prepatent period, the peak
   of parasitemia, and the duration of patency were independent of the size
   of the sporozoite inoculum and the presence of spleen in the host. This
   model is being successfully used to test the protective efficacy of P.
   falciparum preerythrocytic vaccine candidates.},

Journal = {AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES},
Year = {2002},
Number = {3376},
Pages = {1-26},
Month = {JUL 25},
Abstract = {Since their discovery by Western explorers traveling to Madagascar in
   the 17th century, the ruffed lemurs have undergone numerous taxonomic
   revisions. During the 19th and 20th centuries, it was intermittently
   suggested that black-and-white and red ruffed lemurs hybridize in
   nature. Despite the fact that a natural hybrid zone has never been
   documented, this suggestion has played a large role in designating the
   two forms as subspecies of the single species Varecia variegata. Through
   a review and synthesis of historical documents, taxonomic literature,
   museum collections, menagerie and zoo records, recent survey work,
   genetic data, and vocalization data, we examine the evidence for a
   natural hybrid zone and suggest taxonomic revisions. Our work indicates
   a more extensive hybrid zone than previously suggested-but one in which
   hybridization is the exception rather than the rule. Furthermore, our
   findings warrant upgrading the black-and-white ruffed lemur and the red
   ruffed lemur from subspecies to full species, Varecia variegata (Kerr,
   1792) and Varecia rubra (E. Geoffroy, 1812). Our results support the
   current captive breeding practices of U.S. and European zoos
   participating in the ruffed lemur ``Species Survival Plan{''} and the
   ``European Endangered Species Programme{''}. Lastly, and possibly most
   importantly, we can now set specific geographic priorities for
   conserving the habitat of these highly endangered lemurs in northern
   Madagascar.},

   from 60 individuals (E. albocollaris (n = 16), E.f. rufus (n = 14), E.

   Diagnostic (d-loop and microsatellite 26) and private sites (all other

   Also, private sites were found for the purported hybrid population in
   two gene regions (d-loop and ceruloplasmin). When the putative hybrids

   The remaining three individuals were found to contain only markers for

Abstract = {When compared with their recently extinct relatives, living lemurs
   represent a mere fraction of a broad radiation that occupied unique
   niches in the recent past. Among living lemurs, indrids exhibit the
   fastest rates of dental development. This dental precocity is tightly
   correlated with rapid pace of postnatal dental eruption, early
   replacement of the deciduous teeth, high dental endowment at weaning,
   and relatively slow somatic growth. This pattern is in stark contrast to
   that seen in extant lemurids, where somatic development is highly
   accelerated and dental development is relatively slow. We report on the
   pace of dental development in one species of palaeopropithecid, the
   sister group to extant indrids. Like much smaller modern indrids, the
   chimpanzee-sized Palaeopropithecus ingens was dentally precocious at
   birth as evidenced by the advanced state of molar crown formation. This
   finding implies a pattern characteristic of Propithecus and other
   indrids-rapid dental development despite relatively prolonged gestation.
   Gestation length in this one species of subfossil lemur was likely
   greater than 9 months. Our results demonstrate that large body size in
   primates does not preclude exceedingly rapid dental development.},

   53-92 g; n = 16) by rectal probe electroejaculation were evaluated using
   computer-assisted morphometric and kinematic analysis of spermatozoa.
   Epididymidal spermatozoa were collected from six animals after
   hemicastration; the testes were weighed and prepared for stereological
   analysis and flow cytometry. The relative testis mass (as a percentage
   of body weight) ranged between 1.17 and 5.6\%. Twelve stages of
   testicular seminiferous epithelium as described for macaques were
   applied and only a single stage was observed in most of the seminiferous
   tubule cross-sections. On average (mean +/- SD), a single testis
   contained 1870 +/- 829 X 10(6) germ cells and 35 +/- 12 X 10(6) Sertoli
   cells. Germ cell ratios (preleptotene:type B spermatogonia = 2, round
   spermatid:pachytene = 3; elongated spermatid:round spermatids = 1)
   indicated high spermatogenic efficacy. Sperm head dimensions and tail
   lengths of the ejaculated and epididymidal spermatozoa were similar.
   Percentages of defects (neck/mid-piece and tail) were low (< 10\%) and
   similar for ejaculated and epididymidal spermatozoa. Spermatozoa were
   highly motile, characterized by extensive lateral head displacement, but
   relatively low progressive motility. In conclusion, the grey mouse lemur
   has unusually large testes with a highly efficient spermatogenic process
   and large sperm output. These features, together with the high
   proportion of morphologically normal and highly motile spermatozoa in
   the ejaculates, indicate that Microcebus murinus is a species in which
   sperm competition after ejaculation is likely to occur. The
   predominantly single spermatogenic stage system seems to be an ancestral
   feature among primates.},

Abstract = {Sexual selection theory predicts that the relative importance of
   dominance between males for access to females depends on the potential
   to monopolize oestrous females. We examined the relationship between
   male dominance, mating behaviour and reproductive success in a
   promiscuous, nocturnal primate species, the grey mouse lemur, in
   captivity, to test the predictions derived for different competitive
   regimes between males. We also investigated the relationship between
   male age, relatedness between mates and reproductive success. Dominance
   could be established in the majority of the study groups and dominant
   males mated more frequently than subdominant males. Dominant males,
   however, fathered only half of the infants born in the study groups,
   although in principle the captive conditions allowed males to monopolize
   mates. Multiple mating was observed or deduced from the paternity data
   in the majority of groups. For the first time in primates we detected
   one definite case of multiple paternity. Younger males sired more than
   half of the offspring. We conclude that contest competition between
   males is unlikely to be the primary factor predicting the reproductive
   outcome whereas female choice and sperm competition are likely to be
   effective in this seasonal breeder. (C) 2002 The Association for the

Abstract = {Socioecological theory predicts that the distribution of fertile females
   in space and time is the major determinant of male spacing behavior and
   mating strategies. Using a small nocturnal Malagasy primate, the gray
   mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), we determined the spatiotemporal
   distribution of estrous females during the brief annual mating season to
   examine the predictive power of the socioecological model for male
   mating strategies. Mouse lemurs are particularly interesting in this
   respect because this polygynous species is characterized by seasonal
   reproduction, seasonally reversed sexual dimorphism, and relatively
   large testes. All resident animals in our 8-ha study area, a total of 30
   adult males and 27 adult females, were individually marked and regularly
   recaptured to determine female reproductive status and to obtain home
   ran-e data. We found that the mating, season is limited to 4 weeks
   following female emergence from hibernation. Only 3-9 females could have
   synchronized estruses during a given week, indicating a moderately high
   male monopolization potential. However, receptive females were not
   spatially clumped and male ranges overlapped with those of many other
   rivals. Therefore, we suggest that individual powerful males may be
   unable to defend exclusive permanent access to receptive females because
   of prohibitive costs of range defense resulting from the strongly
   male-biased operational sex ratio and the corresponding intruder
   pressure. Our general conclusions are (1) that the socioecological model
   provides a useful heuristic framework for the study of mating systems,
   but that (2) it does not specify the degree of spatiotemporal clumping
   of receptive females at which male mating strategies switch among mate
   guarding, spatial exclusion of rivals, and roaming, and that (3) the
   operational sex ratio can have profound effects on male mating
   strategies as well.},

Abstract = {I aimed to determine when and under which seasonal environmental

   primate species endemic to Madagascar, utilize daily, torpor Using
   temperature-sensitive radio collars, I measured skin temperature (T-sk)
   of free-ranging mouse lemurs under natural conditions. My, results
   showed that male and female mouse lemurs in the wild enter torpor
   spontaneously over a wide range of ambient temperatures (T-a) during the
   dry season, but not during the rainy, season. Mouse lemurs that remained
   normothermic had significantly, lower body, masses (mean: 59.7 g) than
   individuals that used torpor (mean: 80.2 g). Skin temperatures dropped
   to 20.9 degreesC and the mean torpor bout duration is 10.3 h. The use of
   torpor on a given night varied among individuals, whereas the propensity
   for torpor did not differ significantly between males and females. I
   found no evidence that T-a can be used to predict whether mouse lemurs
   will remain normothermic or enter torpor It appears that the most
   reliable indicator for the occurrence of torpor in free-ranging
   Microcebus murinus is time of the year, i.e., photoperiod.},

   operational envelope of robots in its size class (sub-5 kg) through the
   flexible use of its limbs and effectors, as well as through the modular
   changeout of those effectors. In short, LEMUR is intended as a robotic
   instantiation of a six-limbed primate with Swiss Army knife tendencies.
   LEMUR's layout consists of six independently operated limbs arranged in
   two rows of three. The front two limbs have four active degrees of
   freedom while the rear four limbs have three each. Each limb is

Abstract = {Among nocturnal Malagasy prosimians, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus
   murinus) is considered as a solitary species having a promiscuous mating
   system, Indirect evidence, such as the lack of sexual dimorphism, the
   high relative testes size of males and the high synchronism in oestrus
   occurrence among females. supports the presence of a sperm-based
   scramble competition. In captive animals, we used genetic determination
   of paternity to define the relationship between mating success and
   reproductive success of males kept in a group with several females
   during the mating period. Within each group, an intense sexual
   competition arose among males for priority of access to oestrous
   females. High ranking males, as deduced from the direction of agonistic
   interactions displayed a significantly higher frequency of marking
   behaviours, chemosensory investigations of females, and sexual
   behaviours. A robust relationship was found between male rank and
   reproductive success since 16 out of the 17 litters (35 young) produced.
   have been sired by the highest ranked male of the group. Moreover, the
   finding that female aggression was related to both male sexual
   solicitations and to male rank, suggests that females could exert a
   choice. Under specific captive conditions, grey mouse lemurs, showing
   all traits of post-copulatory sperm-based scramble competition, exhibit
   a mating system relying on pre-copulatory aggression-based competition.
   Olfactory signals rather than morphological traits might he used. in
   this nocturnal primate. for both sexual co-ordination between sexes and

Abstract = {Partial cytochrome b sequences were used to study relationships between
   three Lepilemuridae species (Lepilemur dorsalis, L. septentrionalis and
   L. leucopus) and other Lemuridae species. L. dorsalis were subdivided
   into two sub-groups, according to their capture area (Nosy-Be island and
   Sahamalaza peninsula). Relationships deduced from phylogenetic trees as
   well as genetic distances lead to the classification of the Lepilemurs
   analysed here into separate species. These Lepilemurs form a
   monophyletic clade which is the sister clade of all other Lemurs used in
   this study. Reconstructions using randomly chosen sequences and step by
   step addition of sequences indicate that phylogenetic results for
   closely related species need to be analysed with caution, if only a
   small number of sequences are used to obtain them. (C) 2001 Academie des

Abstract = {The modes of intrasexual competition interacting in many dispersed
   societies of nocturnal solitary foragers are still poorly understood. In
   this study we investigate the spatial structure within a free-living
   population of gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) in order to test
   for the first time the predictions from two contrasting models of male
   intrasexual competition on the population level. The contest competition
   model predicts an uneven distribution of the sexes in a population
   nucleus with a female biased sex ratio in the center and a male biased
   sex ratio in the periphery. In contrast the scramble competition model
   predicts males and females being distributed evenly throughout their
   habitat with a constant sex ratio. Nine capture/recapture periods within
   three consecutive mating seasons revealed a continuous male biased sex
   ratio in the adult population with even trapping rates for the sexes.
   The male biased sex ratio could either be explained with postnatal
   female biased mortality or with a male biased natal sex ratio. This male
   biased sex ratio was apparent in all parts of the study site, indicating
   that the population was not subdivided into a female biased core and a
   male biased periphery, Furthermore, the majority of adult males have
   been captured at the same site as or in vicinity to females.
   Consequently, a large proportion of males had spatial access to females
   during the mating season. No signs of monopolization of females by
   certain dominant males could be detected. These data support the
   predictions from the scramble competition model and the concept of a
   promiscuous mating system for this species.},

   inhabited all vegetation formations except for a newly planted corridor
   of tree saplings. Capture rates of both endemic species were
   uncorrelated with the number of R. rattus caught at the same site and
   thus did not indicate replacement of native species by R. rattus. The
   study demonstrated negative effects of fragmentation on capture rates of

Abstract = {In order to cope with the seasonal variations in ambient temperature and
   food availability in the natural habitat gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   murinus) exhibit adaptive energy-saving mechanisms similar to those in
   hibernating species with seasonal and daily heterothermia. To determine
   thermoregulatory responses, via telemetry we recorded body temperature
   and locomotor activity variations during the breeding season in three
   captive male mouse lemurs kept at ambient temperatures (T-a ranging from
   18 degrees to 34 degreesC. Rhythms in body temperature and locomotor
   activity were clearly exhibited regardless of ambient temperature. As
   T-a increased, mean body temperature increased from 36.5 +/- 0.1
   degreesC to 37.6 +/- 0.3 degreesC, with significant change in the
   amplitude of the body temperature rhythm when T-a rose above 28
   degreesC. Effects of T-a were mostly due to changes in the fall in body
   temperature occurring daily at the beginning of the light phase when the
   subjects entered diurnal sleep. The daily decrease in body temperature
   was not modified by exposure to ambient temperatures from 18 degreesC to
   28 degreesC whereas it disappeared tinder warmer condition. Changes in
   locomotor activity levels only delayed the occurrence of
   thermoregulatory modulation. These results strongly suggest that, during
   the breeding season, the thermoneutral zone of mouse lemurs is close to
   28 degreesC and that the diurnal fall in body termperature could be
   considered as an important adaptive energy-saving mechanism adjusted to
   ecological constraints.},

Abstract = {Several ecological and physiological factors have been suggested to
   structure circadian activity in cathemeral primates, i.e., those that
   are regularly active both day and night, but; their relative importance
   remains controversial. We studied the nocturnal activity of a group of
   cathemeral redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus) in Kirindy Forest in
   Western Madagascar to examine its relationship with one environmental
   factor, ambient light levels, in detail. To this end, nightly travel
   distances and moon luminosity were determined between March and June
   1996. During this transitional period between the wet and dry seasons
   these redfronted lemurs were regularly active at night, and traveled
   significantly larger distances during full-moon nights compared to
   new-moon nights. The importance of ambient luminosity for nocturnal
   activity was high-lighted by observations during a total lunar eclipse
   (i.e., during a full-moon night), which caused abrupt cessation of the
   animal's activity. Our results support the hypothesis that nocturnal
   activity of these cathemeral lemurs is regulated also by changes in
   ambient light levels. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   Analysis of the studbook provides an insight into the genetic diversity

   individuals in toes and research establishments Analyses of the data do
   not bode well for future of the European mouse lemur population.
   Although the number of individuals would seem to be sufficient to form a
   sound basis for future management, the population has inadequate genetic
   variability Furthermore, inbreeding also seems to have had a negative
   impact on the reproductive output of the population. Thus, immediate
   action needs to be taken if a viable mouse lemur population is to be

Abstract = {Microcebus murinus exhibits highly seasonal biological rhythms to cope
   with extreme seasonality in availability of resources. To study the role
   of daylength on seasonal changes in body mass and reproductive function,
   we exposed male and female gray mouse lemurs to natural constant, or
   alternating light cycles for 2 years under constant environmental
   conditions. When exposed to either constant short (SD: 10 h light/day),
   long (LD: 14 h light/day), or intermediate (ID: 12 h light/day)
   daylength, males and females maintained a constant body mass with no
   spontaneous cyclic variation. We only observed typical seasonal body
   mass changes in subjects exposed to alternating periods of SD and LD,
   the weight gain being triggered by SD, whereas weight loss occurred
   under LD. Reproductive activity in females proceeded from an endogenous
   rhythm that was expressed under constant daylengths. In contrast changes
   in reproductive activity in males depended on daylength variation. In
   both sexes, SD and LD have direct inhibitory or stimulatory effects on
   reproductive activity. In females daylength regulates breeding season by
   synchronizing an endogenous sexual rhythm with the season whereas in
   males, the perception of a critical photoperiod is used to determine the
   subsequent onset or arrest of their breeding season. These sexual
   differences in the effect of daylength could be related to sex-specific
   differences in reproductive constraints.},

Abstract = {Estrous synchrony in seasonal breeders can in principle be based on and
   shaped by environmental, internal, and/or social cues. We analyzed the
   dynamics of estrous synchrony for the first time in a seasonal,
   nocturnal primate species, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). We
   compared successive estrous cycles and different levels of spatial
   proximity over two reproductive seasons in a captive population in order
   to identify possible social influences on estrous synchrony. The females
   exhibited a marked estrous synchrony at the beginning of each
   reproductive season but we found no indication of a process of socially
   induced synchronization among them. Females housed in the same cage/room
   were not more strongly synchronized than females housed in different
   cages/rooms. Moreover, cycles desynchronized from the first to the
   second estrus of the season. Estrous cycle length did not depend on age
   parity, or social housing conditions, but instead mainly on the
   individuality of the femurs. This individuality, shown for the first
   time in a nocturnal primate species, is likely to be based on an
   endogenous rhythm with a genetic basis. We discuss possible social
   advantages, e.g., communal rearing, and disadvantages, e.g., mate choice
   and female-female competition, of estrous synchrony for nocturnal

   weight changes. We investigated and compared reproductive activities and
   changes in monthly body weight in males and females of successfully
   bleeding colonies of both species under the same photoperiodic
   conditions. Females of both species showed estrous cycles only during
   the long-day period. Rufous mouse lemur females seemed to have a shorter
   gestation than their sibling species (57 vs. 62 days). The number of
   estrous cycles (2.25 vs. 2.5/season) and their lengths (59 vs. 52 days)
   were similar Litter size (2) seemed to be similar Latency of estrous
   occurrence after photoperiodic stimulation was longer in Microcebus
   rufus than in its sibling species (71.6 and 42.3 days). The same was
   true for the onset of the growth of the testes. The rate of growth and
   size of the testes were similar, and precede the estrous onset in both
   species. The reproductive activity was shorter in both sexes of the
   rufous than of the gray mouse lemurs. In both species, body weight
   showed similar seasonal changes. Males lost more weight during the
   breeding season than females did. In rufous mouse lemurs, body weight
   was similar in both sexes during the nonbreeding season. In gray mouse

Abstract = {In order to estimate fermentative capacity among lemur species, four
   fiber substrates were tested across three herbivorous species: Eulemur
   fulvus, Hapalemur griseus, and Varecia variegata. Substrates were
   cellulose (CE), beet pulp (BP), citrus pulp (CP), and citrus pectin
   (PE), which ranged in composition from completely insoluble fiber (CE)
   to completely soluble fiber (PE), respectively. Animals were offered the
   same diet for a thirty day adaptation period which consisted of 85\% of
   the diet dry matter Mazuri Leafeater Mini Biscuit (\#5672, Purina Mills
   Inc., St. Louis MO) and 15\% of the diet dry matter a mixture of locally
   available produce. Following the adaptation period, feces collected from
   donor animals were used to inoculate fermentation tubes pre-filled with
   the fiber substrates and an anaerobic growth medium. Dry matter
   disappearance (DMD) and total short-chain fatty acid production were
   measured in tubes subjected to 6, 12, 24, or 48 h of fermentation.
   Production plateaus were not reached by 48 h for BP and CP substrates.
   The DMD of PE was higher at 48 h than other substrates (p<.0001). For
   all substrates, inoculum from V. variegata produced lower DMD values at
   48 h than E fulvus or H. griseus. V. variegata produced more total short
   chain fatty acids (p<.005) from PE at 6 and 12 h and from CP at 6 h when
   compared to the other species. Results provide some evidence for
   differences in fermentative capacity across the three species, and
   suggest that fiber solubility and fermentability should be addressed in
   assessing their nutritional management needs.},

Title = {Aspects of reproduction in the eastern rufous mouse lemur (Microcebus
   rufus) and their implications for captive management},

Abstract = {The eastern rufous mouse lemur is one of the smallest primate species.
   It inhabits the eastern rain forest of Madagascar. Its reproductive
   biology has not been examined because of its rarity in laboratories. We
   present the first data on reproduction and variation in reproductive
   success from a breeding colony of wild-caught Microcebus rufus. The
   eastern rufous mouse lemur shows a seasonal change in testicular size
   and in the occurrence of estrus. Females had 2.5 cycles (range, one to
   four) per season. The estrous cycle length was 59 days (range, 51-66),
   the duration of vaginal opening during estrus was 7.5 days (range, 5-8),
   receptivity occurred on the third day of estrus, gestation length was
   56.5 days (range, 56-57), litter size was two neonates (range, one to
   three). The frequency and duration of mating behavior varied widely
   among the pairs. Copulation seemed to occur on a single day per estrus
   within the first to fourth hour after light change to red light. In four
   cases (three pairs), copulation lasted between 15 and 240 seconds.
   Breeding success can be increased by choosing mates carefully.
   Microcebus rufus seems to be a seasonal breeder like its sibling species
   Microcebus murinus. In wild-caught animals, males seemed to adapt
   quickly (first season) to the conditions of captivity, whereas in the
   females, individual variation (first to third season) in reproductive
   activity was observed. Air humidity of > 60\% seems to facilitate the
   breeding success in wild-caught pairs. First pregnancy and successful
   rearing of offspring occurred in the second and fourth year of captivity
   in two of three females. Wild-caught eastern rufous mouse lemurs seemed
   to demonstrate variation in adapting to the conditions of captivity with
   regard to sex and individuality. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {To cope with the 6-month dry winter occurring in its natural habitat,
   the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), a Malagasy prosimian primate,
   exhibits a pre-wintering fattening phase that has been previously
   demonstrated to be dependent on the photoperiod. To assess early changes
   in energy balance following a photoperiodic shift, food intake (FI).
   resting metabolic rate (RMR), plasma triglycerides, plasma thyroxine and
   urinary excretion of cortisol were measured in 12 males and 12 females
   for 8 weeks following a shift from short(SP: 10 h light/day) to long(LP:
   14 h light:day) photoperiod or from LP to SP. Shift from LP to SP led to
   a high, linear body mass (BM) increase in both sexes, concomitant to an
   increase in plasma triglycerides and a decrease in plasma thyroxine,
   while no change in RMR occurred. FI significantly increased from 30 to
   40 kcal/day as early as the first week following SP exposure but
   spontaneously decreased after 4 weeks, reaching minimal values (10
   kcal:day) after 14 weeks of SP exposure. Shift from SP to LP led to a
   decrease in BM and an increase in FI, but both were slow and different
   between males and females. No change in RMR was observed except a
   significant increase in males during the first week of LP exposure.
   However. plasma thyroxine levels and cortisol excretion similarly
   increased in both sexes following LP exposure. These results suggest
   that autumnal fattening mainly proceed from changes in Fl and in
   thyroxine secretion triggered by exposure to SP. In contrast, BM loss
   following LP exposure would be related to seasonal sexual activation
   rather than to a direct control by photoperiod. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {The vomeronasal organ (VNO) is a chemosensory structure of the
   vertebrate nasal septum that has been recently shown to exist in nearly
   all adult humans. Although its link to reproductive behaviors has been
   shown in some primates, its functionality in humans is still debated.
   Some authors have suggested that the human VNO has the capacity to
   detect pheromones, while others described it as little more than a
   glandular pit. However, no studies have utilized histochemical
   techniques that would reveal whether the human VNO functions as a
   generalized gland duct or a specialized chemosensory organ. Nasal septal
   tissue from 13 humans (2-86 years old) were compared to that of two
   adult lemurs (Microcebus murinus) and eight adult voles (four Microtus
   pennsylvanicus and four Microtus ochrogaster). Sections at selected
   intervals of the VNO were stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS),
   alcian blue (AB), AB-PAS, and PAS-hematoxylin procedures. Results
   revealed typical well-developed VNOs with tubuloacinar glands in
   Microtus and Microcebus. VNO glands were AB-negative and PAS-positive in
   voles and mouse lemurs. Homo differed from Microtus and Microcebus in
   having more branched, AB and PAS-positive glands that emptied into the
   VNO lumen. Furthermore, the human VNO epithelium had unicellular mucous
   glands (AB and PAS-positive) and cilia, similar to respiratory
   epithelia. These results demonstrate unique characteristics of the human
   VNO which at once differs from glandular ducts (e.g., cilia) and also
   from the VNOs of mammals possessing demonstrably functional VNO. Anat

Abstract = {Morphological and behavioural traits which improve agonistic power are
   subject to intrasexual selection and, at the proximate level, are
   influenced by circulating androgens. Because intrasexual selection in
   mammals is more intense among males, they typically dominate females.
   Female social dominance is therefore unexpected and, indeed, I arc.
   Ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) are sexually monomorphic primates ill
   which all adult fc males dominate all males. The goal of our study was
   to test the prediction that female dominance in this species is
   associated with high androgen levels. Using two captive groups, we
   collected data on agonistic behaviour and non-invasively assessed their
   androgen concentrations in faeces and saliva Ly enzyme immunoassay. We
   found that adult female L. catta do not have higher androgen levels than
   males. However, during the mating season there was a twofold increase in
   both the androgen levels and conflict rates among females. This seasonal
   increase in their androgen levels was probably not due to a general
   increase ill ovarian hormone production because those females showing
   the strongest signs of follicular development tended to have low
   androgen concentrations. At the individual level neither the individual
   aggression rates nor the proportion of same-sexed individuals dominated
   were correlated with their. androgen levels. We conclude that female
   dominance in ring-tailed lemurs is neither based on physical superiority
   nor. on high androgen levels and that it is equally important to study
   male subordination and prenatal brain priming effects for a complete
   understanding of this phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Entomacrodus lemuria is described from specimens from Madagascar,
   Mauritius, and Renunion, and E. williamsi is described from specimens
   from Halmahera (Indonesia), Madang (Papua New Guinea), and Duff Islands
   (Santa Cruz Islands, Solomon Islands). New distribution records are
   provided for E. sealei, a widely distributed Pacific plate endemic, and
   E. corneliae, a Marquesas Islands endemic. All four species are members
   of the Nigricans Group of Entomacrodus, which group is distinguished
   from all other blenniids in having the lateral thirds of the ventral
   margin of the upper lip crenulate and the middle third entire. Within
   the group, these four species form a subgroup distinguished by having
   most of the five preopercular pore positions represented externally by
   pairs or multiples of pores, as opposed to rarely having more than one
   or two positions with pairs or multiples of pores.},

Abstract = {The two sites in northwestern Madagascar, where Ramanantsoa (1976)
   observed ``sacred lemurs{''}, were revisited in order to assess the
   present status of Eulemur macaco and the possible impact of human
   beliefs and practices on conservation. All the sacred relationships
   towards lemurs described in 1976 are still in practice, and very similar
   descriptions about the benefic (or malefic in case of non-respect)
   effect of the ``sacred lemurs{''} have been quoted by our informants. A
   direct impact on lemur conservation, and utilisation of study sires for
   scientists, as suggested by G.-A. Ramanantsoa, do not appear as
   realistic options, considering the remote location of both sites. In
   contrast, a further study of religious practices concerning lemurs
   should be an important contribution for shaping sustainable development

   energetic consequences and biological significance},
Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {123},

Abstract = {Patterns and energetic consequences of spontaneous daily torpor were
   measured in the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) under natural
   conditions of ambient temperature and photoperiod in a dry deciduous
   forest in western Madagascar. Over a period of two consecutive dry
   seasons, oxygen consumption (VO2) and body temperature (T-b) were
   measured on ten individuals kept in outdoor enclosures. In all animals,
   spontaneous daily torpor occurred on a daily basis with torpor bouts
   lasting from 3.6 to 17.6 h, with a mean torpor bout duration of 9.3 h.
   On average, body temperatures in torpor were 17.3+/-4.9 degrees C with a
   recorded minimum value of 7.8 degrees C. Torpor was not restricted to
   the mouse lemurs' diurnal resting phase: entries occurred throughout the
   night and arousals mainly around midday, coinciding with the daily
   ambient temperature maximum. Arousal from torpor was a two-phase process
   with a first passive, exogenous heating where the T-b of animals
   increased from the torpor T-b minimum to a mean value of 27.1 degrees C
   before the second, endogenous heat production commenced to fur ther
   raise Tb to normothermic values. Metabolic rate during torpor
   (28.6+/-13.2 ml O-2 h(-1)) was significantly reduced by about 76\%
   compared to resting metabolic rate (132.6+/-50.5 ml O-2 h(-1)). On
   average, for all M. murinus individuals measured, hypometabolism during
   daily torpor reduced daily energy expenditure by about 38\%. In
   conclusion, all these energy-conserving mechanisms of the nocturnal
   mouse lemurs, with passive exogenous heating during arousal from torpor,
   low minimum torpor T(b)s, and extended torpor bouts into the activity
   phase, comprise an important and highly adapted mechanism to minimize
   energetic costs in response to unfavorable environmental conditions and
   may play a crucial role for individual fitness.},

Title = {A preliminary study of spatial distribution and mating system of pygmy
   mouse lemurs (Microcebus cf myoxinus)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-60},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {According to current hypotheses on the evolution of life history traits
   and social systems of Malagasy lemurs, nocturnality is associated with a
   solitary lifestyle and a polygynous or promiscuous mating system. Recent
   studies, however, have indicated that this may not be true of all
   femurs. The goal of this study was to investigate the sociality and the
   mating system of pygmy mouse lemurs (Microcebus cf myoxinus), which are
   the smallest known primates, and which retain characteristics of the
   most primitive primates. I compared my findings with data on the
   sympatric Microcebus murinus and Cheirogaleus medius. Observational,
   morphometric and spatial distribution data were obtained by a
   radiotracking study in 1994, and from a capture-recapture study
   conducted during 1995/ 96. Pygmy mouse lemurs usually slept alone in a
   tangle of vegetation. During the mating season, sleeping sites of males
   were distributed over a much broader area than were female sites,
   indicating that male home ranges are larger than those of females. The
   home ranges of males overlapped during the mating season, and males
   occasionally roamed over long distances during a single night. Pygmy
   mouse lemurs forage primarily alone. Analysis of estrus stages indicate
   that female cycles are unsynchronized during the mating season. There
   was a lack of sexual dimorphism in body size but not in body mass. Males
   were heavier than females during the reproductive season but lighter
   than females the rest of the year. Testes of males varied in size
   seasonally and enlarged significantly during the mating season. The
   presence of a vaginal sperm plug in a female indicated the importance of
   preventing additional matings in this species. Thus pygmy mouse lemurs
   follow the predictions derived from sexual selection theory for
   multi-male mating systems with promiscuous matings and male sperm
   competition. Am. J. Primatol. 51:41-60, 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {A phylogenetic analysis of the family Lemuridae was accomplished using
   multiple gene partitions and morphological characters. The results of
   the study suggest that several nodes in the lemurid phylogeny can be
   robustly resolved; however, the relationships of the species within the
   genus Eulemur are problematically nonrobust. The genus Varecia is
   strongly supported as the basal genus in the family. Hapalemur and Lemur
   catta are strongly supported as sister taxa and together are the sister
   group to the genus Eulemur. E. mongoz is the most basal species in the
   genus Eulemur. E. fulvus subspecies form a monophyletic group with three
   distinct lineages. E. coronatus is strongly supported as the sister
   taxon to E. macaco. The relationships off. rubriventer E. fulvus, and
   the E. macaco-E. coronatus pair are unresolved. Our combined molecular
   and morphological analysis demonstrates the lack of influence that
   morphology has on the simultaneous analysis tree when these two kinds of
   data are given equal weight. The effects of several extreme weighting
   schemes (removal of transitions and of third positions in protein-coding
   regions) and maximum-likelihood analysis were also explored. We suggest
   that these other forms of inference add little to resolving the
   problematic relationships of the species in the genus Eulemur: (C) 2000

Abstract = {Movements of forelimb joints and segments during walking in the brown
   lemur (Eulemur fulvus) were analyzed using cineradiography (150
   frames/sec). Metric gait parameters, forelimb kinematics, and intralimb
   coordination are described. Calculation of contribution of segment
   displacements to stance propulsion shows that scapular retroversion in a
   fulcrum near the vertebral border causes more than 60\% of propulsion.
   The contribution by the shoulder joint is 30\%, elbow joint 5\%, and
   wrist joint 1\% Correlation analysis was applied to reveal the
   interdependency between metric and kinematic parameters. Only the
   effective angular movement of the elbow joint during stance is
   speed-dependent. Movements of all other forelimb joints and segments are
   independent of speed and influence, mainly, linear gait parameters
   (stride length, stance length). Perhaps the most important result is the
   hitherto unknown and unexpected degree of scapular mobility. Scapular
   movements consist of ante-/retroversion, adduction/abduction, and
   scapular rotation about the longitudinal axis. Inside rotation of the
   scapula (60 degrees-70 degrees), together with flexion in the shoulder
   joint, mediates abduction of the humerus, which is not achieved in the
   shoulder joint, and is therefore strikingly different from humeral
   abduction in man. Movements of the shoulder joint are restricted to
   flexion and extension. At touch down, the shoulder joint of the brown
   lemur is more extended compared to that of other small mammals. The
   relatively long humerus and forearm, characteristic for primates, are
   thus effectively converted into stride length. Observed asymmetries in
   metric and kinematic behavior of the left and right forelimb are caused
   by an unequal lateral bending of the spinal column. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss,

   replicating X was always the less methylated chromosome. Compared with
   autosomes, the methylation of both X chromosomes was always lower in
   fibroblasts than in lymphocytes and the difference was always greater in
   mouse than in human. In human, mouse and lemur male cells, the labelling
   of the unique X chromosome was quite similar to that of the early
   replicating X from female cells. Except for the heterochromatic region
   of the human Y chromosome, strongly methylated, the overall methylation
   of the Y chromosome was low. In mouse testicular cells, a variety of DNA
   methylation patterns was observed according to the cell type and the
   state of differentiation. Finally, the only structures of sex
   chromosomes which remain methylated in all conditions correspond to

Pages = {21-29},
Abstract = {Endocrine profiles were investigated in wild and captive mongoose lemurs
   (Eulemur mongoz; Lemuridae) by analysing faecal progestagens and
   oestrogens. Oestrous cycle characterization was not possible, as most
   females appeared to conceive during the first oestrus of the breeding
   season. Conception was preceded by a pseudo-oestrus with no discernible
   luteal phase. Pseudo-oestrus and oestrus identification was possible by
   investigating the oestrogen : progestagen ratio. Pregnancy was reliably
   determined approximately 47 days after conception, when progestagen and
   oestrogen excretion increased above breeding season concentrations.
   Gestation was further characterized by high progestagen concentrations
   and a decline in oestrogen excretion 70-80 days after conception. Post
   partum, progestagens declined, but oestrogen excretion increased to
   exceed breeding season concentrations. In the wild group, a nulliparous
   daughter conceived while still a member of her natal group and aborted
   after 70-80 days of pregnancy at which time progestagens had declined
   but oestrogens remained high. Comparisons with other strepsirhine
   primates suggest that pseudo-oestrus followed by conception at first
   oestrus may be prevalent in lemurs. Gestational progesterone profiles
   Vary between species, but a delayed increase in oestrogens during
   pregnancy could be common to all strepsirhines, although oestrogen
   levels during the final trimester of pregnancy differ between lemurs and
   lorises. Methodological investigations showed that prolonged storage of
   faeces in ethanol is viable and that the presence of undigested
   vegetable matter in the faecal pellets had no effect on the
   interpretation of hormone profiles.},

   Seven of these animals were examined for neuropathology. In 12 out of 17

   six animals had severe atrophy of the temporal lobe. Another subgroup of
   five animals displayed diffuse atrophy in addition to the temporal
   atrophy. One animal had a dilation of the external part of the temporal
   horn of the lateral ventricle in addition to the temporal atrophy. The
   three animals with diffuse atrophy that could be studied for
   neuropathology had diffuse cerebral amyloid deposits detected by
   immunocytochemistry The other animals did not display amyloid deposits.

Abstract = {In the free-running circadian locomotor activity rhythm of a 7-year-old
   male owl monkey (Aotus lemurinus griseimembra) kept under constant light
   and climatic conditions (LL 0.2 lux, 25 degrees C +/- 1 degrees C, 60
   +/- 5\% relative humidity {[}RH]), a second rhythm component developed
   that showed strong relative coordination with the free-running activity
   rhythm of 24.4h and a 24h rhythm. The simultaneously recorded feeding
   activity rhythm strongly resembled this rhythm component. Therefore, it
   seems justified to infer that there was an internal desynchronization
   between the two behavioral rhythms or their circadian pacemakers, that
   is, between the light-entrainable oscillator located in the
   suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and a food-entrainable oscillator located
   outside the SCN. This internal desynchronization may have been induced
   and/or maintained by a zeitgeber effect of the (irregular) 24h feeding
   schedule on the food-entrainable oscillator. The weak relative
   coordination shown by the activity rhythm indicates a much weaker
   coupling of the light-entrainable oscillator to the food-entrainable
   oscillator than vice versa.},

Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-24},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Knowledge of the social organization of lemurs is still limited for most
   species. Where there is sufficient information, it has been shown that
   lemur social organization differs in essential points from that of other
   primates. In the field study reported here, demographic structure and
   life-history processes were investigated in order to characterize the
   social organization of the Alaotran gentle lemur (Hapalemur griseus
   alaotrensis). Data were obtained through captures and observations.
   Alaotran gentle lemurs were found in small groups of up to nine
   individuals. Although most groups contained just one breeding female, a
   substantial proportion of groups (35\%) had two breeding females.
   Therefore, Alaotran gentle lemurs cannot be classed as being organized
   in monogamous family groups. An extended birth season was found, and
   groups with two breeding females had significantly higher breeding
   output per adult than groups with a single adult female. Limited data
   suggest that females emigrate from their natal group while still
   subadult, whereas males can stay in the natal group until they are fully
   grown and disperse as adults. Variability in group composition,
   significantly higher reproductive output per adult in groups with two
   breeding females, and delayed dispersal of males suggest that Alaotran
   gentle lemurs pursue a resource-defense mating strategy, rather than a
   female-defense mating strategy. The suggestion that extant social lemurs
   may have evolved from a monogamous system, could explain the differences
   between lemur social systems and those of other primates. (C) 2000

Title = {Aspects of social life in the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {49},

Abstract = {Body weight is an important attribute of any animal and influences its
   biology in many ways. In the case of the fat-tailed dwarf lemur
   (Cheirogaleus medius), this is of special interest because animals of
   this species store fat to survive extended torpor phases during the
   austral winter and, as a result, show extreme seasonal variation in body
   weight. In this paper, I present field data from a 20-month study at the
   Forestry Station of Ampijoroa in northwestern Madagascar on body weights
   of repeatedly trapped individuals combined with trapping results to
   investigate the general biology and notably the social life of C.
   medius. The most remarkable physical characteristic of wild C. medius is
   a dramatic weight-loss in males in September following emergence from
   torpor. Trapping results showed that adult males emerge from torpor
   earlier than females and offspring, even though food is still scarce.
   Early emergence from torpor puts males at an energetic disadvantage and
   confers no advantage in terms of access to females. Observation data
   from nightly follows indicate that males patrol their home range,
   probably to guarantee its integrity for the coming active season and
   to;secure the food supply for their families. The high energetic costs
   of this strategy is argued to represent a form of paternal investment.
   Body weight data of repeatedly captured individuals showed that they may
   reach adult size and sexual maturity at 2 years of age but are not
   socially mature before the age of 3 years. The data presented may serve
   as a guide for keeping C. medius at a suitable weight in captivity. (C)

Journal = {CHROMOSOMA},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {108},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {We used multidirectional chromosome painting with probes derived by
   bivariate flourescence-activated flow sol ting of chromosomes from
   human, black lemur (Eulemur macaco macaco) and tree shrew (Tupaia
   belangeri, order Scandentia) to better define the karyological
   relationship of tree shrews and primates. An assumed close relationship
   between tree shrews and primates also assists in the reconstruction of
   the ancestral primate karyotype taking the tree shrew as an
   ``out-group{''} species. The results indicate that T. belangeri has a
   highly derived karyotype. Tandem fusions or fissions of chromosomal
   segments seem to be the predominant mechanism in the evolution of this
   tree shrew karyotype. The 22 human autosomal painting probes delineated
   40 different segments, which is in the range found in most mammals
   analyzed by chromosome painting up to now. There were no reciprocal
   translocations that would distinguish the karyotype of the tree shrew
   from an assumed primitive primate karyotype. This karyotype would have
   included the chromosomal forms la, Ib, 2a, 2b, 3/21, 4-11, 12a/22a,
   12b/22b, 13, 14/15, 16a, 16b, 17, 18, 19a, 19b, 20 and X and Y and had a
   diploid chromosome number of 2n = 50. Of these forms, chromosomes la,
   Ib, 4, 8, 12a/22a, and 12b/22b may be common derived characters that
   would link the tree shrew with primates. To define the exact
   phylogenetic relationships of the tree shrews and the genomic
   rearrangements that gave rise to the primates and eventually to humans
   further chromosome painting in Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Dermoptera and
   Chiroptera is needed, but many of the landmarks of genomic evolution are
   now known.},

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {In group-living Malagasy primates (Lemuriformes), certain demographic
   and morphological traits deviate both from theoretical expectations
   derived from sexual selection theory and from patterns in better-known
   anthropoid primates. Lemurs lack sexual dimorphism in body and canine
   size and live in relatively small multimale-multifemale groups with, on
   average, even adult sex ratios, despite a polygynous mating system. In
   addition, the majority of gregarious lemurs are cathemeral, that is,
   they are regularly active both day and night. The social system of
   cathemeral lemurs has been considered an adaptation to their activity
   pattern. If so, groups should consist of multiple pairs that aggregate
   during diurnal activity and range separately at night in response to
   predation and infanticide risk, respectively. Moreover, mating
   privileges should exist between pair partners. We tested this hypothesis
   with data collected on two groups of wild redfronted lemurs in western
   Madagascar during 1023 focal animal hours spanning 4 months including
   the mating season. In addition, data on spatial relations were collected
   on 12 nights. We found no differences in group cohesion between day and
   night and no behavioural evidence for multiple male-female pairs.
   Instead, one male in each group monopolized social interactions with all
   females. However, females copulated with all resident males, although
   most often with the central male. Thus, basic predictions df the
   cathemerality hypothesis are unsupported. Multiple matings and
   indications of oestrous synchrony can be viewed as female
   counterstrategies against infanticide, whereas reproductive strategies
   of redfronted lemur males remain obscure. (C) 1999 The Association for

Abstract = {The present study was undertaken to explore the distribution of
   lipofuscin in the brain of cheirogaleids by autofluorescence and compare
   it to other studies of iron distribution. Aged dwarf(Cheirogaleus
   medius) and mouse (Microcebus murinus) lemurs provide a reliable model
   for the study of normal and pathological cerebral aging. Accumulation of
   lipofuscin, an age pigment derived by lipid peroxidation, constitutes
   the most reliable cytological change correlated with neuronal aging.
   Brain sections of four aged (8-15 year old) and 3 young (2-3 year old)
   animals were examined. Lipofuscin accumulation was observed in the aged
   animals but not in the young ones. Affected regions include the
   hippocampus (granular and pyramidal cells), where no iron accumulation
   was observed, the olfactory nucleus and the olfactory bulb (mitral
   cells), the basal forebrain, the hypothalamus, the cerebellum (Purkinje
   cells), the neocortex (essentially in the pyramidal cells), and the
   brainstem. Even though iron is known to catalyse lipid oxidation, our
   data indicate that iron deposits and lipofuscin accumulation are not
   coincident. Different biochemical and morphological cellular
   compartments might be involved in iron and lipofuscin deposition. The
   nonuniform distribution of lipofuscin indicates that brain structures
   are not equally sensitive to the factors causing lipofuscin
   accumulation. The small size, the rapid maturity, and the relatively
   short life expectancy of the cheirogaleids make them a good model system
   in which to investigate the mechanisms of lipofuscinogenesis in
   primates. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   forest tree species seems to depend upon the presence of E. fulvus.},

Abstract = {This is the first long-term, simultaneous, comparative study of three
   bamboo lemur species (Hapalemur griseus, H. aureus, and H. simus) at a
   site in southeastern-central Madagascar where they occur in sympatry. At
   Talatakely, Ranomafana National Park, the three Hapalemur spp. share
   overlapping home ranges. Hapalemur griseus has flexible group sizes,
   varying from three to nine individuals (n = 6). The home range of
   Hapalemur griseus averages 15 ha (n = 2). Hapalemur aureus forms family
   groups of less than or equal to 4 individuals (n = 3); they have a home
   range! on average of 26 ha (n = 2). The single group of Hapalemur simus
   is composed of one or three adult males, two adult females, and their
   offspring; they occupy a home range of 62 ha. The three species of
   Hapalemur are year-round bamboo specialists: >88\% of their diets
   consist of bamboo and grass in the Family Poaceae, Contrary to earlier
   findings, all three Hapalemur spp. consume the cynogenic parts-young
   leaf bases, young pseudopetioles, and young shoots-of the giant bamboo,
   Cathariostachys madagascariensis. They rely heavily on this plant, which
   comprises 72-95\% of their diets. Hapalemur griseus and H. aureus
   consume similar proportions of bamboo vs. nonbamboo plants, though they
   differ in the species of bamboo they prefer: Hapalemur simus has the
   most distinct diet of the three bamboo lemurs. They exploit the young
   shoots of Cathariostachys madagascariensis during the austral summer
   rainy season, between November and April. From June to November
   Hapalemur simus shifts its diet to eating the mature culm pith of
   Cathariostachys madagascariensis; the proportion of pith represented in
   their diet reaches a maximum of 89\% in October. Seasonal availability
   of food resources, feeding competition, and factors related to body size
   may provide clues to the understanding of diet selection among the three
   sympatric Hapalemur spp.},

Abstract = {Aotus monkeys are good models for erythrocyte-induced Plasmodium
   falciparum and P. vivax infections and have been extensively used in
   malarial drug and vaccine development. Recently, it has been shown that
   certain species of Aotus can be infected with sporozoites, and that the
   degree of susceptibility varies among species. We demonstrate here that
   Panamanian Aotus lemurinus lemurinus are susceptible to a
   sporozoite-induced infection, opening the possibility that this species
   of Aotus could be used as models for testing the efficacy of
   pre-erythrocytic P. falciparum vaccines and drug candidates directed at
   the pre-erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria. In
   this species, we compared sporozoite infection rates. Two of four
   animals splenectomized prior to infection with sporozoites developed
   patent parasitemias. Seven of eight animals splenectomized either 7 or
   35 days after infection became parasitemic. Additionally, we used a P.
   falciparum-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect the
   early appearance of parasitized erythrocytes in the blood prior to
   detection by conventional microscopy, and found that the parasitemia was
   detected first in five animals by the PCR method, first in three animals
   by blood film, with one parasitemia detected simultaneously. We also
   demonstrated the feasibility of infecting monkeys located in Panama with
   sporozoites isolated at an insectary in Atlanta, thus documenting the
   feasibility of similar studies where the insectary and monkey colony are
   not in the same location. A subsequent attempt to infect these monkeys
   using sporozoites was not successful, suggesting that this model of
   human malaria is not yet ready for routine use in vaccine or drug
   efficacy screening. This model merits further study because of the
   importance of testing pre-erythrocytic P. falciparum malaria vaccines
   and drugs in animals.},

Abstract = {The study of physiological stress and its context in free-ranging
   animals provides a means for understanding the challenges found in the
   natural habitat. Patterns of physiological stress in free-ranging
   animals have yet to be well characterized. Methodological difficulties
   in measuring physiological responses in the natural habitat have limited
   this area of research. In this research, physiological stress in
   free-ranging ring-tailed lemurs, Lemut catta, was estimated using a
   steroid-extraction method to measure cortisol levels from female faeces.
   Ten females were observed across two social groups in southwestern
   Madagascar during a 5-month period including portions of the annual wet
   and dry-seasons. I used behavioural measures to estimate predation
   threat, food accessibility and individual dominance status, to determine
   whether these variables predict faecal cortisol levels. Faecal cortisol
   levels were relatively high during two distinct periods: one period
   coincided with late gestation and the other period corresponded with the
   end of the dry season, when high-intensity antipredatory behaviour and
   estimates of feeding effort were elevated. In addition, faecal cortisol
   measures were significantly correlated with dominance indices:
   high-index individuals had high cortisol values, and low-index
   individuals had low cortisol values. These results suggest that faecal
   cortisol measures can be used to assess seasonal and individual
   differences in adrenal activity in this lemurid primate, and that this
   measure could provide a means-for quantifying physiological stress in
   free-ranging animals. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal

   of the fat-tailed dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus medius},

Volume = {105},

Abstract = {According to present hypotheses on the evolution of life history traits
   and social systems in Malagasy lemurs, nocturnality and infant parking
   are associated with a solitary lifestyle and a polygynous mating system.
   However, theoretically extreme seasonality of reproduction could limit
   the number of females that can be monopolized by a given male and thus
   hinder the evolution of polygyny. The aim of this ongoing study is to
   test these contrasting expectations by looking at the social and mating
   system of the fat-tailed dwarf lemur Cheirogaleus medius. This species
   hibernates for up to 7 mo, so that time for breeding and raising
   offspring is extremely limited.
   A mark-recapture study in western Madagascar was combined with
   observations and radio-tracking of 36 individuals during the rainy
   seasons from 1995 to 1998. According to these data, fat-tailed dwarf
   lemurs live in permanent sleeping groups consisting of a male and a
   female (n = 8) or one male and two females (n = 1). One or two offspring
   from the previous year were frequently observed to sleep together with
   an adult pair. Members of each sleeping group were the exclusive users
   of their nest holes and home ranges. During the birth season, males and
   females took turns at baby-sitting their offspring. Females without
   paternal help were unable to raise their offspring successfully. Since
   females did not exhibit oestrus synchrony, the ultimate selective factor
   favouring pair-living could be obligate paternal investment. The
   results, together with the lack of sexual size dimorphism and relatively
   small testis size, suggest that the fat-tailed dwarf lemur lives in
   family groups with a monogamous mating system. A review of the mating
   systems of nocturnal lemurs shows that monogamy appears to be the rule
   rather the exception.},

Abstract = {Feeding behavior in two groups of semi free-ranging primates, lion
   tailed macaques (LTM) (Macaca silenus, n = 9) and ring-tailed lemurs
   (RTL) (Lemur catta, n = 13), residing on St. Catherines Island, GA, was
   observed seasonally at quarterly intervals for 1 year. Each group had
   unlimited access to native flora and fauna in addition to a daily
   provisioned diet; LTM were observed a total of 144 hours and RTL for 208
   hours. We hypothesized that foods selected by macaques would be lower in
   macronutrients and higher in fiber than those consumed by lemurs owing
   to body size differences. Samples of plant foods observed eaten (106
   samples from 30 identified species) were collected, air-dried in the
   field, and analyzed for macronutrient, fiber, and mineral content.
   Leaves and seeds were important diet components for semi free-ranging
   LTM most of the year, comprising 51\% to 93\% of observed feeding time
   on nonprovisioned food items, with ripe fruit a major food item (40\% of
   observed feeding time) only during the August sampling period. In
   general, RTL consumed a more diverse diet of fruits and leaves during
   all seasons, with seeds and buds increasingly important during winter
   months (45\% of observed feeding time). Based on the nutrient
   composition of different plant parts, weighted by the percentage
   contribution (feeding time assumed equivalent to mass of forage intake)
   of each part, no difference was seen in fiber (LTM 56.8 +/- 21.9\% of
   DM, RTL 38.4 +/- 16.7\% DM) or crude protein content of diets consumed
   (LTM 9.0 +/- 2.9\% DM, RTL 11.5 +/- 6.7\% DM) throughout the year.
   Weighted diets contained mineral concentrations meeting recommended
   values for non-human primates of Mg, Cu, Mn, and Zn, but were low in Na,
   P, and Fe, as well as Ca (LTM only). Despite wide differences in
   individual food items selected, overall diets were remarkably similar in
   macronutrient composition between these two disparate primates. (C) 1999

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {51-60},
Abstract = {Four forest areas were censused in southeastern Madagascar from
   June-August 1995 to estimate local population densities and habitat
   conditions for two threatened subspecies of brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus
   collaris and Eulemur fulvus albocollaris). Survey transects varied in
   length (1-3.5 km) and in surveillance frequency (three to seven times).
   Additional test surveys were conducted at the Pare National de
   Rano-mafana to compare transect methods in an area with known population
   densities of Eulemur fulvus. Based on these tests, we demonstrate that
   the use of existing trails for transects can result in a close estimate
   of local population size, although more replications and longer
   transects increase precision. Results from regional surveys indicate
   considerably smaller population densities for E. f. albocollaris (0.086
   animals/ha). In contrast, E. f. collaris densities were relatively high
   (.107 animals/ha) at Midongy-Sud. We also noted variation among sites in
   the density of lianas, which was positively correlated with local
   population density (a possible indication of habitat degradation). More
   generally, habitats in E. f. albocollaris's range suffered from
   fragmentation, reduction in forest area, logging, and potentially
   greater hunting pressure. Based on these results, it is apparent that

Abstract = {The exploratory behaviour of young and grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   murinus) in an experimental enclosure containing various objects was
   recorded. A new object was added for each test session and could
   displace an object that had previously been introduced to a new
   position. For young grey mouse lemurs, there was an obvious preference
   for new objects and for displaced familiar objects. This indicates that
   they are able, like other primates, to ``map out{''} and memorize their
   environment. For the aged grey mouse lemurs, preference for the new
   objects was very slight. No reaction to changes in the location of
   familiar objects was noted. Age-related deficits in memory, in
   particular spatial memory, could account for this lack of response to
   changes in the environment.},

Abstract = {The lesser mouse lemur, a small Malagasy primate, is exposed to strong
   seasonal variations in ambient temperature and food availability in its
   natural habitat. To face these environmental constraints, this nocturnal
   primate exhibits biological seasonal rhythms that are photoperiodically
   driven. To determine the role of daylength on thermoregulatory responses
   to changes in ambient temperature, evaporative water loss (EWL), body
   temperature (T-b) and oxygen consumption, measured as resting metabolic
   rate (RMR), were measured in response to ambient temperatures ranging
   from 5 degrees C to 35 degrees C, in eight males exposed to either short
   (10L:14D) or long (14L:10D) daylengths in controlled captive conditions.
   In both photoperiods, EWL, T-b and RMR were significantly modified by
   ambient temperatures. Exposure to ambient temperatures below 25 degrees
   C was associated with a decrease in T-b and an increase in RMR, whereas
   EWL remained constant. Heat exposure caused an increase in T-b and heat
   loss through evaporative pathways. Thermoregulatory responses to changes
   in ambient temperature significantly differed according to daylength.
   Daily variations in T-b and EWL were characterized by high values during
   the night. During the diurnal rest, lower values were found and a phase
   of heterothermia occurred in the early morning followed by a spontaneous
   rewarming. The amplitude of T-b decrease with or without the occurrence
   of torpor (T-b < 33 degrees C) was dependent on both ambient temperature
   and photoperiod. This would support the hypothesis of advanced
   thermoregulatory processes in mouse lemurs in response to selective
   environmental pressure, the major external cue being photoperiodic
   variations.},

Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},
Pages = {459-472},

Abstract = {This study compares locomotor and postural behavior and substrate use of
   three species of lemur, the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema
   edwardsi), the brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus rufus), and the red-bellied
   lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) at two different localities within
   Ranomafana National Park. The object of the study is to see if there are
   quantitative differences in the behavior of the lemurs or their choice
   of substrates in forests that have different structural attributes.
   Analysis of the physical characteristics of the habitat demonstrates
   that compared to the Talatakely area, the Forest at Vatoharanana has a
   higher proportion of larger, taller trees. The behavior of the lemurs
   also differs in the two areas: all species leap less and climb and move
   quadrupedally more at Vatoharanana. All species use small size supports
   less frequently at Vatoharanana, choosing instead medium size supports
   (all three species) or tiny supports (Propithecus and E. fulvus) found
   in tree crowns and terminal branches. The Lemurs prefer (i.e. use more
   often than would be expected based on abundance) large tn:es at both
   sites, At Vatoharanana however, they are more frequently observed higher
   in trees and in taller trees with greater trunk breadth. The differences
   in locomotor behavior are in part due to the fact that at Vatoharanana,
   more bouts are collected during feeding and foraging than during travel.
   The relationship between this difference in activity pattern and the
   structural differences in the two forests, however, is nit clear. This
   study points out the need for longer term field studies of positional
   behavior and substrate use that incorporate the variety of forest types
   the subject species inhabit.},

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {I studied the insulation capacity of tree holes used by gray mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus murinus) in a primary dry deciduous forest in western
   Madagascar during the cool dry season. Tree holes had an insulating
   effect, and fluctuations of air temperatures were less extreme inside
   the holes than outside them. The insulation capacity of the tree holes
   peaked between 0800 and 1100 hr, when ambient temperatures ranged
   between 25 and 30 degrees C. To compare tree holes, I calculated the
   mean difference between the internal temperature)(T-i) and the external
   temperature (T-e) for each tree hole. Thus large differences indicate
   good insulation capacities. The mean difference of tree holes in living
   trees was significantly larger than that of tree holes in dead trees,
   which shows that insulation in living trees is more effective. During
   the dry season, the insulation capacity of tree holes in living trees
   decreased and was lowest in July, whereas the insulation capacity of
   holes in dead trees remained approximately constant. Physiological
   studies under natural temperature and light condition in Microcebus
   murinus reveal that daily torpor saves around 40\% of the daily energy
   expenditure compared to normothermia. However, torpor can be maintained
   only up to the threshold body and ambient temperature of 28 degrees C,
   whereat Microcebus murinus have to terminate torpor actively. By
   occupying insulating free holes, mouse lemurs may stay longer in torpor,
   which increases their daily energy savings by an extra 5\%.},

Abstract = {We address questions regarding the general absence of dimorphism in
   lemurid primates (Hapalemur, Eulemur, and Varecia) through comparative
   analyses of ontogeny. We described and analyzed body mass growth data
   for 9 lemurid taxa and compared them to similar data for anthropoid
   primates. Lemurids tend to grow rapidly over a short period of time when
   compared to anthropoid primates of similar body sizes. Size variation
   among lemurid taxa arises primarily as a consequence of differences in
   rates of growth. Comparative analyses of body mass growth data suggest
   that natural selection has produced ontogenetic adaptations in lemurids
   that center on relatively short periods of growth. Reduced growth
   periods preclude the evolution of sexual dimorphism through bimaturism-a
   sex difference in the length of the growth period-despite high levels of
   intermale competition. Selective factors related to seasonal variability
   of lemurid habitats play important roles in limiting the potential for
   the evolution of bimaturism. Other selective factors that limit
   bimaturism are related to female reproductive synchrony. In combination,
   they favor relatively early male maturation, precluding sexual selection
   that would otherwise promote the evolution of dimorphism through
   bimaturism. Natural selection on growth rates may preclude somatic
   responses to sexual selection that involve elevated male growth rates.
   In general, existing ontogenetic or life history adaptations appear to
   restrict responses to sexual selection in male lemurids.},

Abstract = {The hypothesis that the vomeronasal organ has an important functional
   relationship with, and led to the evolution of, the prosimian toothcomb
   has not been well tested. This paper examines the diversity of
   anatomical strepsirrhinism across several mammalian taxa to determine if
   fossil and living strepsirrhine primates exhibit any derived characters
   that may highlight the functional link between the vomeronasal organ and
   the toothcomb, and to examine the potential importance of anatomical
   strepsirrhinism to toothcomb origins. Results indicate that extant
   gregarious lemuriforms are derived in having a relatively wide
   interincisal gap, providing an unobstructed line of communication
   between the vomeronasal organ and anterior rostral structures such as
   the toothcomb. This finding is consistent with the proposal that
   anatomical strepsirrhinism is functionally related to use of the
   toothcomb in grooming. However, the importance of the vomeronasal organ
   to toothcomb origins is less clear. If the morphology of adapiforms and
   non-gregarious lemuriforms is representative of the morphology of basal
   lemuriforms, then it can be inferred that early lemuriforms did not
   possess the wide-gap autapomorphy; hence, anatomical evidence discussed
   here cannot be used to rule out non-social hypotheses of toothcomb
   origins. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   can be built up to provide individuals to reinforce or re-establish wild
   populations. However, there is evidence to suggest that captive-bred
   animals lack the skills necessary for survival in their natural habitat.
   This research was designed to assess whether a group of captive-bred
   Varecia variegata variegata exhibit such behavioral deficiencies in
   relation to feeding behavior compared to two wild groups. A further aim
   was to determine which of four methods of food presentation and two
   captive environments were most effective in encouraging the exhibition
   of natural feeding behavior. An identical focal animal, instantaneous
   time-sampling technique was used to collect data from the wild groups in
   the Betampona Reserve, Madagascar, and the captive group at Chester, UK.
   Results from Betampona confirm the highly frugivorous and arboreal
   nature of V. v. variegata. Under all captive conditions, except the
   rooftop feed in the cage environment, the captive V. v. variegata spent
   significantly less time feeding than their wild conspecifics. Suspensory
   feeding postures are an important adaptation enabling wild V. v.
   variegata to harvest fruit in the small-branch setting. Similar
   frequencies of use of such postures to those observed at Betampona were
   most effectively encouraged among captive V. v. variegata in the cage
   environment by the rooftop food presentation method and on a
   naturalistic island exhibit by the suspended method of food
   presentation. Differences in feeding behavior between the wild and
   captive V. v. variegata can be explained in terms of structural
   differences between their environments. As naturalistic captive
   environments allow lemurs to experience the challenges associated with
   feeding in the wild, it is strongly recommended that toes endeavor to
   provide them with such conditions. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Sexual advertisement calls of male mouse lemurs from two neighbouring
   demes in a dry deciduous forest of western Madagascar were recorded
   during the breeding season. Demes were located about 1.5 km apart with
   no geographic barrier between them. They were characterised
   morphometrically and genotyped by RAPD fingerprinting. According to
   univariate and multivariate statistical analysis, demes differed neither
   in body measurements, nor in the banding patterns produced by RAPD
   fingerprinting. The acoustic pattern of the advertisement call, however,
   showed significant differences: Six variables of the frequency and time
   domain differed between the demes. Discriminant function analysis
   revealed that one variable, total call duration, was sufficient to
   classify more than 89\% of the calls correctly to the corresponding
   deme. We postulate that these differences are comparable to dialects in
   birds, because demes were morphologically and genetically
   indistinguishable and no barrier prevented genetic exchange between
   them. Possible explanations for the emergence of dialects in a prosimian
   species are outlined.},

Abstract = {During a 3 month field study, 18 group encounters between four groups of
   Alaotran gentle lemurs (Hapalemur griseus alaotrensis) were observed in
   the Lake Alaotra marshland in Madagascar. Behaviors observed during

   interactions and ranging patterns are discussed in the context of
   territoriality. Intergroup interactions varied in their intensity,
   ranging from visual monitoring, scent marking, and display locomotion to
   penetrating the neighboring range. A quarter (27\%) of the encounters
   were aggressive, involving chases and confrontation displays, and no
   affiliative interactions were observed. Both adult males and females
   were involved in intergroup encounters, with males playing more active
   roles. All encounters took place in the small overlapping areas of
   neighboring home ranges. The outcome of an aggressive encounter was
   determined by its location, with the resident group always driving out
   the intruding one. The Alaotran gentle lemur actively advertised and
   consistently defended a large area of its home range against intrusion
   of neighboring groups and can therefore be considered territorial. Am.

Year = {1998},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Sleeping sites are a potentially important resource for grey mouse
   lemurs since they are confronted with high daily temperature
   fluctuations and a high predation pressure. In order to determine the
   existence and degree of resource competition, sleeping site
   characteristics, locations, and usage patterns as well as sleeping group
   compositions were investigated in a 3 month field study in a dry
   deciduous forest of northwestern Madagascar. The daily sleeping sites of
   females were on average better insulated and safer than those of males.
   Males used more sleeping sites and changed the site more often than
   females. During the whole study, males slept alone, whereas the females
   formed stable sleeping groups in on average 83.7\% of the days.
   Sex-specific differences in usage patterns might be explained by
   intersexual resource competition and female dominance and could possibly
   be related to differential parental investment of the sexes. The
   underlying study indicates that sleeping sites may be a restricted and
   defendable resource for grey mouse lemurs. The investigation gives new
   insights into the distribution patterns and social organization of this

Abstract = {Primary forest cover in western Madagascar declined from 12.5\% in 1950
   to 2.8\% in 1990. Approximately 23\% of remaining forest is located
   within reserves, but this is no guarantee of protection. Forest cover in
   the Andranomena Reserve in western Madagascar has been reduced by 44\%
   since 1950. The identification of priority areas for establishment of
   development projects has been constrained by lack of information on the
   distribution, abundance, and habitat requirements of threatened species
   and the size, condition, and threats to survival of forest remnants. We
   evaluate a rapid fauna survey and habitat modeling procedure
   specifically designed to generate information for reserve selection and
   design using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The study was
   conducted in the largest remnant (94,000 ha) of primary monsoon
   rainforest in western Madagascar, using lemurs as an indicator group.
   Lemur abundance and microhabitat variables were measured at 64
   stratified survey sites dispersed throughout the region. These records
   were incorporated into a GIS with other environmental and landuse data
   derived from maps and satellite imagery. Statistical procedures were
   applied to analyze species habitats, predict and map species
   distributions, and estimate species population sizes throughout the
   study area. Patterns of slash and burn agriculture and anthropogenic
   disturbance were also analyzed to identify areas at low risk of cultural
   disturbance. A map of disturbance risk was overlaid with a map of
   relative lemur biodiversity to identify conservation priority areas with
   high biodiversity and low risk of short term disturbance. Lemur
   diversity was most strongly influenced by habitat clearing and human
   disturbance (harvesting, stock grazing, and hunting) within 8 km of
   villages. Lemur diversity was highest in a region of higher elevation
   and rainfall, distant from villages and roads. The only existing reserve
   in the study area was located in a region of high disturbance risk.
   Almost half the reserve has been degraded during the past 45 years.
   There is considerable scope for re-allocation of land use within the
   study area to include a core protected area, a buffer zone with
   controlled hunting and timber harvesting, and an adjacent ecotourism
   facility. We found that information generated by a stratified
   biodiversity and landuse survey at a sampling intensity of less than
   0.1\% was sufficient to provide and objective foundation for regional
   biodiversity planning.},

Title = {Test of Fox's assembly rule for functional groups in lemur communities

Volume = {241},

Pages = {533-542},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper examines to what extent an assembly rule designed by Fox for
   small terrestrial mammal communities is also applicable to communities
   of arboreal lemurs in Madagascar. This approach extends the testing of
   Fox's assembly rule to a new biogeographic region and a different
   phylogenetic radiation. The rule operates on a functional rather than on
   the taxonomic level. It specifies that: `'There is a much higher
   probability that each species entering a community will be drawn from a
   different functional group... until each group is represented before the
   cycle repeats'' (Fox, 1987: 201). This rule was tested with lemur
   communities from 14 sites in evergreen rain forests and nine sites in
   dry deciduous forests of Madagascar. Lemur species were assigned to one
   of three different functional groups based on dietary preferences:
   omnivores, frugivores, folivores. The rule applies almost perfectly to
   extant lemur communities in evergreen rain forest. Present communities
   in dry deciduous forests are not ordered as perfectly as communities of
   the rain forest sites, but they also deviate from random assembly as
   generated by the null model. Including extinct species of the dry forest
   ecosystem indicates that the at present unfavoured composition of the
   lemur community has been derived from a favoured state through
   extinction of the large folivorous and frugivorous lemur species. In the
   lemur communities of the eastern Malagasy rain forest, the assembly went
   through at least four, and in the Holocene dry forest ecosystem through
   even five, cycles without failing. This assigns considerable
   significance to the underlying mechanisms (most Likely interspecific
   competition) and indicates that they are still effective in the forests
   of Madagascar. The dry deciduous forests might have been subject to
   recent natural and anthropogenic changes which interfere with the
   operation of these deterministic processes.},

Abstract = {The lesser mouse lemur, a polygynous prosimian primate, demonstrates
   significant bias of sex ratio at birth in agreement with the predictions
   of the Local Competition Resource model for adaptive adjustment of sex
   ratios. When isolated prior to conception, females overproduced
   daughters while grouped females demonstrated a significant inverse
   tendency. Biased sex ratios were dependent neither on mother's body
   condition nor on litter size, suggesting that bias occurred at
   conception. The maternal investment allocated to offspring in terms of
   foetal growth, infant growth and survival until weaning did not differ
   according to the sex of newborn. Nevertheless, male newborn promoted
   maternal behaviour during early infancy (from birth to day 15) since in
   litters without males, survival and growth of neonate females
   significantly decreased. In mouse lemurs, social communication primarily
   relies on olfactory cues and significant biased sex ratios can be
   obtained by exposing isolated females to urinary cues from other
   females. Urinary stimulation was delivered from the beginning of sexual
   activity until oestrus. The direction of bias depended upon the temporal
   occurrence of chemical signal exposure, while female fecundity depended
   upon its duration. Possible mechanisms involved in sex biased conception
   are discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {The mean body weight of a species is often used as a summary measure of
   size in evolutionary and functional studies. Additionally, body weight
   is often used to assess the health of captive animals. Contrasts of the
   captive and wild body weights of a species can be used to examine the
   effects of captivity on the species. We provide an analysis of adult
   body weight in nine taxa of Malagasy lemurs. We compare weights of wild
   and captive lemurs and provide analyses of relationships between captive
   weight variation and management actions. Body weights are derived from a
   number of sources, the majority from the Duke University Primate Center
   (DUPC) capture and husbandry records. Captive animals are, on average,
   heavier than wild conspecifics. However, the difference is significant
   in only three taxa (Hapalemur griseus griseus, Eulemur coronatus, E.
   macaco flavifrons). Based on a retrospective analysis of DUPC records,
   we assess patterns of adult weight relative to caging conditions and
   evaluate changes in mean weight over a period of approximately 20 years.
   Cage type appears to have no effect on body weight. Mean weight has
   decreased for some taxa housed at the DUPC over time. We calculate a
   weight-based criterion for identifying obese animals and demonstrate
   that obesity is not currently a prevalent condition in DUPC lemurs.
   Examinations of the physiological correlates of excessive weight, and
   especially relationships between weight and reproductive success, await
   further analysis. These analyses need to be based, in part, on reliable
   measures of body weight. We suggest that systematic weighing of wild and
   captive animals is important for further examinations of the overall
   health of captive animals as well as for studies ranging in scope from
   evolutionary to clinical. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Chromosome painting using commercially available human
   chromosome-specific DNA libraries was performed to elucidate chromosomal
   rearrangements in lemur evolution. Human-specific probes for chromosomes
   3, 14, 15, and 21 were used to paint chromosomes of six species: Eulemur
   fulvus mayottensis, Varecia variegata, Lemur catta, Hapalemur simus, H.
   griseus griseus, and H. aureus. All human chromosome libraries
   hybridized specifically to chromosome segments of varying length or to
   whole arms of Lemur chromosomes. The labeling was clearly visualized and
   permitted precise delineation of the hybridized Lemur chromosomal
   segments. The use of commercial probes of human chromosomes for
   chromosome painting appears efficient enough to investigate homology in
   different species of Lemur. In general, the results obtained by
   chromosome painting in this study confirm results previously obtained by
   the R-banding technique but modify the location of some chromosomal
   rearrangements on different branches of the evolutionary tree of the
   Lemuridae and reveal some new rearrangements that were not detectable
   with banding techniques. These results show that chromosome painting
   with human chromosome-specific DNA libraries can provide useful
   information in comparative studies on karyotypes of distantly related
   mammalian species, providing a powerful tool for evolutionary studies,
   especially in phylogeny.},

Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {44-59},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Lemur is an application for sinusoidal timbre manipulation that is
   available to anyone with an Apple Macintosh computer. Lemur implements
   an extended McAulay-Quatieri (McAulay and Quatieri 1985, 1986) algorithm
   for sound analysis and synthesis, which is based on the work of Rob
   Maher and Tames Beauchamp (Maher 1989). The Lemur analysis consists of a
   series of short-time Fourier spectra, from which significant frequency
   components are selected. Similar components in successive spectra are
   linked to form time-varying partials, called tracks. The number of
   significant frequency components, and, thus, the number of tracks, may
   vary over the duration of a sound. Syn thesis is performed by a bank of
   oscillators, with each oscillator reproducing the frequency and
   amplitude trajectory of a single track. Phase accuracy is maintained
   using cubic phase (parabolic frequency) interpolation between spectra.
   The Lemur model allows for extensive sound modification via Lemur's
   built-in editing functions, or by using other customized editors to
   modify the intermediate analysis file before performing resynthesis. As
   the Lemur file format contains only amplitude, frequency, and linking
   information for each track, it is easy for users to write customized
   Lemur file editors. This article discusses the sinusoidal model as it is
   implemented in Lemur, and its application to timbre manipulation.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A major mid-Devonian floral event is the incoming and proliferation of
   the archaeopteridalean progymnosperms. They are generally accepted to
   have originated from the aneurophytalean progymnosperms. The spores from
   both groups (the microspore Geminospora lemurata and its megaspore
   Contagisporites optivus-Archaeopteridales; Rhabdosporites
   langii-Aneurophytales) are well, represented in the Orcadian Basin,
   Scotland. Study of a long section in southern Orkney shows that G.
   lemurata first occurs not by progressive size reduction of R. langii but
   as a small thick-walled spore (''earIy form'') which is presumed to
   originate by heterochrony directly from an immature Rhabdosporites. It
   then progressively increases in size. This early stage of evolution can
   be timed using the lacustrine cyclicity. Subsequently a rapid increase
   in abundance occurs with G. lemurata replacing R langii as the dominant
   element of the palynofloras. Originating after the first appearance of
   G. lemurata are spores transitional in morphology between R langii and
   C. optivus indicating the progressive development of the megaspore.
   These changes together with the presence of a three-walled species of
   Rhabdosporites (Rhabdosporites streelii Marshall, sp. nov.) give a hint
   of the complex changes occurring within the sporangia of the
   archaeopteridalean group at this time. These changes show how detailed
   investigation of related spore taxa can reveal the pattern of the
   development of heterospory in the Progymnosperms. This permits for the
   first time a test of the theoretical models for the development of
   heterospory. The recognition that an `'early form'' of G. lemurata
   exists indicates that some caution should be exercised in using the
   first occurrence of this species as a stratigraphic marker.
   Rhabdosporites parvulus is confirmed as a small. R langii but the bulk
   of specimens formerly attributed to this species are G. lemurata. The
   means that the Eday Group sediments of Orkney are contemporaneous with
   the Devonian deposits of southeast Shetland and Fair Isle.},

Year = {1996},
Volume = {100},
Number = {4},
Pages = {487-506},

Abstract = {In this study, I tested two hypotheses regarding the relationship of
   ecological variables (size, density, and distribution of patches) and
   infant developmental patterns to lemur social structure using two
   prosimian primates in Ranomafana, Madagascar: the rufous lemur (Eulemur
   fulvus rufus) and the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer). Three
   predictions regarding the general effects of patch size and subgroup
   size on lemur feeding rates were supported: (1) Rufous lemurs used large
   patches; red-bellied lemurs used smaller patches; (2) larger subgroups
   of rufous lemurs used larger patches; and (3) rufous lemur feeding rates
   decreased significantly with increases in subgroup size and patch size,
   whereas size and patch size had no significant effect on red-bellied
   lemur feeding rates. However, food item size (fruit) had a more
   significant effect on rufous and red-bellied lemur feeding rates than
   either patch size or subgroup size. When similar-sized fruits were
   compared, rufous lemur feeding rates on small fruit were most affected
   by patch size, yet feeding rates on medium-sized fruit were most
   affected by subgroup size. Neither lemur species used patches in
   consistent ways seasonally. During periods of food abundance, rufous
   lemurs used many small, common, and clumped patches. In food scarcity
   periods, they used fewer, larger, rarer, and less clumped patches;
   groups migrated when food became most scarce. Red-bellied lemurs also
   used patches in variable ways, but these patterns were not linked with
   food availability. Finally, infant development patterns differed between
   lemur species; red-bellied lemur males cared for offspring and infants
   reached developmental landmarks faster than rufous lemur infants.
   Therefore, red-bellied lemur group size may be constrained by the need
   for additional infant care by other group members. In contrast, rufous
   lemur group size may be constrained by patch availability during the
   most critical period of food scarcity. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The ringtailed lemur, Lemur catta, and Verreaux's sifaka, Propithecus

   playbacks of conspecific alarm calls differ when the vocalizations were
   produced in response to aerial predators as opposed to terrestrial
   predators. We conducted playback experiments on two populations of
   ringtailed lemurs, using two types of sifaka alarm calls. One population
   consisted of free-ranging groups which lived sympatrically with sifakas,
   the other was a colony group which had no contact with sifakas. The
   results illustrate that the former group of lemurs can perceive what
   type of predators the sifaka calls refer to, whereas the latter group
   was not able to recognize the difference in the calls.},

Volume = {99},

Abstract = {A comparative study of carpal joint structure and function in six
   Malagasy lemuriforms was undertaken to test predicted morphoclines in
   carpal joint morphology between pronograde and orthograde arboreal
   primates. Patterns of movement at the wrist during locomotion were
   observed and described for the lemuriform species Lemur fulvus and
   Propithecus verreauxi. Lemur fulvus, which assumes a pronograde posture
   during locomotion, extends and pronates the wrist during the support
   phase of quadrupedal walking and running stride cycles. Furthermore, the
   forearm of this species exhibits some transverse movement across the
   proximal wrist joint during the support phase. In contrast, the indriid
   Propithecus maintains the hand and wrist in a flexed and partially
   supinated position during vertical clinging and suspensory postures.
   Habitual quadrupedal and vertical postures in Malagasy primates are in
   turn related to very different patterns of carpal joint morphology and
   articular mechanics. Those lemurs which are predominantly pronograde
   share a series of structural features related to stabilizing the
   antebrachiocarpal joint during extension and mediolateral deviation and
   the midcarpal joint during pronation: an intraarticular labrum is
   present on the inner portion of the radiocarpal ligament, the
   radiocarpal articular surface is quite flat dorsoventrally, the
   capitate-trapezoid embrasure is expanded dorsally, and development of
   the radial and ulnar styloids is more pronounced. The wrists of
   Propithecus, Avahi, and Lepilemur (vertical clingers) differ from those
   of quadrupedal lemuriforms in possessing a suite of morphological
   features related to stabilizing the wrist during antebrachiocarpal
   flexion and midcarpal supination: the radiocarpal articular surface is
   deeply curved and tilted anteriorly, the dorsal radiocarpal ligament is
   very broad, thick, and fibrous, the hamate's triquetral facet is
   directed proximodistally, and the capitate-trapezoid embrasure is
   dorsally constricted and expanded palmarly. These observed contrasts in
   carpal form and function are used to define further the morphological
   features related to orthograde posture in several lineages of arboreal
   primates. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {We recently obtained the brain of a rare lemuroid primate, Cheirogaleus
   medius. The brain was not perfused before death, but rather fixed by
   immersion shortly thereafter. In both flat-mounted and transversely
   sectioned tissue, we were able to clearly demonstrate periodic zones of
   high cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity in the primary visual cortex,
   resembling the so-called `blobs' described in many other primate
   species. Our results contrast with a previous report indicating that
   blobs are absent in Cheirogaleus medius and provide support for the view
   that blobs are an evolutionary specialization of primate visual cortex
   that evolved only once, early in primate history. In other aspects of
   architectonic organization, area V1 of this Cheirogaleus individual
   closely resembles that of other strepsirhine primates, such as Galago.
   We were able to identify additional divisions of cortex in this
   individual, including the middle temporal visual area (MT), auditory
   cortex, and the primary somatosensory area (S1 or area 3b). These
   observations indicate that valuable neuroanatomical information can, in
   favorable cases, be obtained from rare mammalian species that die of
   natural causes in captivity or which must be euthanized, even though the
   animals have not been perfused.},

   7 and 19 produced unexpectedly strong signals in the centromeric regions

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},

Abstract = {This report documents the death of two fat-tailed dwarf lemurs
   (Cheirogaleus medius) maintained over 6 years each in our laboratory.
   Postmortem studies revealed xanthogranuloma of the choroid plexus, a
   mass replete with stored lipids, including cholesterol crystals. Six
   months prior to their deaths, both animals developed a peculiar head
   tilt and signs suggestive of neurological dysfunction. At autopsy, each
   had masses projecting into the lateral and IVth ventricles and an
   associated obstructive hydrocephalus. Cryostat sections of the brains of
   both lemurs showed histological features consistent with xanthogranuloma
   of the choroid plexus, a histologically benign and usually asymptomatic
   lesion found in up to 7\% of human autopsies. This case is of special
   interest because of the unique feeding strategies in the fat-tailed
   dwarf lemur. Since C. medius remains in torpor for 6 months out of the
   year during the time of food scarcity in the forests of Madagascar, the
   animal must accumulate large reserves of fat during its active period.
   In the laboratory, however, dwarf lemurs do not normally go into torpor,
   and the accumulated fat is not used. The finding of this tumor,
   therefore, suggests that the combination of a captive high-fat diet and
   the unusual fat-storage mechanisms utilized by C. medius contributed to
   the buildup of lipids and might be etiologically related to the
   development of these lesions. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The Malagasy primates (Infraorder Lemuriformes) are a highly diverse
   taxonomic assemblage whose phylogenetic affinities have been the subject
   of extended debate. There have been numerous proposals to suggest that
   the lemuriforms are not monophyletic and that there have been multiple
   migrations of primates between Madagascar and other land masses during
   primate evolutionary history. The phylogenetic analysis of a
   comprehensive morphological data set and DNA sequences from the complete
   mitochondrial cytochrome b gene suggests otherwise, however. These data,
   whether analyzed separately or together, give support to the hypothesis
   that the Malagasy primates, including the family Cheirogaleidae and the
   genus Daubentonia, are monophyletic. A distance analysis of the
   cytochrome b data further suggests that lemurs arrived on Madagascar and
   began to diversify by the early Eocene. Current species distributions
   and phylogenetic branching patterns indicate that the lemuriform stem
   lineage originated on Africa and probably traveled to Madagascar via
   rafting.},

Abstract = {Twenty-one ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) were videotaped during

   feeding sequences provided duration-based measures of manipulation, hand
   and mouth lateralization, and posture during feeding sequences with 2
   types of food. Hand preference for reaching and holding was stable over
   time and across measurement conditions. As a group, the lemurs grasped
   fruit bimanually more often than chow; however, right- and ambipreferent
   lemurs spent more time holding food bimanually than did left- ones.
   Older animals consumed chow more quickly than did younger animals but
   did not differ in their rate of manipulation. Lemurs had a preference
   for using one side of the mouth in feeding, but this had no directional
   relation to preferred hand. Three postural feeding patterns were
   identified.},

   4 monkeys developed extended prepatent periods and low grade
   parasitemias followed by self cure. The fourth monkey did not develop a
   patent infection. Immune monkey serum passively transferred at the time
   of challenge conferred immunity to 20 naive monkeys. Immunity was
   characterized by extended prepatent periods in 19 monkeys, low levels of
   parasitemia (less than or equal to 1\%) followed by self cure in 12
   animals, and lack of detectable infection in 3 recipient monkeys, Immune
   serum collected from monkeys undergoing repeated challenges afforded
   more protection than serum from singly infected monkeys. However, single
   doses of hyperimmune serum appeared to be as effective as multiple
   doses. Normal serum had no effect on the course of infection in 12
   monkeys. These studies confirm that owl monkeys can be immunized by

   LATERALIZED FORAGING IN THE GENTLE LEMUR (HAPALEMUR GRISEUS)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-77},
Abstract = {Lateralized patterns of hand use in species-typical bamboo shoot
   foraging were evaluated for efficiency in five female and six male
   gentle lemurs (Hapalemur griseus sp.). Efficiency was defined as amount
   of time required to complete a foraging response sequence. The foraging
   pattern consisted of four component movements: PULL-IN, COUNTERFORCE,
   TURN, and FEED-IN. These component movements had been shown in a
   previous study to incorporate lateral hand biases that formed subsets of
   patterns that were characteristic for each gentle lemur. The duration of
   each foraging sequence was measured from the beginning of the first
   component to the initiation of the terminal component. Frequency of use
   scores were employed to divide the pattern sequences of each subject
   into preferred and nonpreferred categories. A within-subjects comparison
   of the mean durations of preferred patterns (M = 2.56 sec) with those of
   nonpreferred patterns (M = 3.02 sec) found that preferred patterns were
   executed more rapidly, t(10) = 3.36, P = .007. A multiple regression
   showed that order of pattern preference accounted for 89\% of the
   variance in mean duration of response time (R(2) = .89, P = .056). Thus,
   the use of preferred lateralized hand patterns resulted in more rapid
   bamboo shoot harvesting. Speed in foraging may be regarded as an
   adaptive strategy for a species that subsists on a high bulk, low
   nutrient density food such as bamboo. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The lesser mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is one of six sympatric
   nocturnal primates found in the Kirindy forest, west-Madagascar. Each of
   these species is reported to consume a secretion produced during the
   austral winter by the Homopteran insect Flatidia coccinea. In July and
   August 1993 a study was conducted to determine the importance of this
   food resource in the ecology of female M. murinus. At this study site,
   animals were distributed only along the forest edge where insect
   secretions are significantly more abundant than in the forest interior.
   Abundances of arboreal and nocturnal flying insects do not differ
   between the forest edge and interior. Experimental resource removal from
   a 25 x 25 m plot in one female's home range caused a significant shift
   in the animals' pattern of habitat use while no change occurred in a
   control plot. Thus, at this study site and time of year, the ranging
   behavior of a female M. murinus was strongly influenced by the presence
   of Homopteran secretions. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},

Abstract = {Most nocturnal Malagasy primates, as well as many diurnal species, are
   highly endangered in their natural habitat. Captive breeding programs
   have been established for many species, but detailed information on
   reproduction is only available for three nocturnal taxa: the mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus), the dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius), and the
   greater dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus major). In this study, we present data
   for another nocturnal Malagasy primate, Coquerel's dwarf lemur (Mirza
   coquereli), which has been propagated since 1982 at the Duke University
   Primate Center. Unlike all other Malagasy primates bred in captivity, M.
   coquereli cycles throughout the year, and is clearly less seasonal in
   its birth distribution than is C. medius or M. murinus. Estrous
   intervals ranged between 19 and 30.5 days. Estrus lasted no longer than
   1 day. After an average gestation length of 89.2 days, litters of one or
   two were born. Females cycled for the first time between 8 and 15 months
   of age, and gave birth for the first time between 12.8 and 33.5 months
   of age. The earliest mating of a male leading to conception was observed
   at the age of 17 months. For males and females, an increase in daylength
   appears to trigger pubertal development. Males had seasonal changes in
   testicular volume which were not explained by covariation with body
   weight. Maximum testis size occurred in spring, when breeding activity
   was highest. The occurrence of year-round reproduction in M. coquereli,
   and the absence of seasonal fattening and/or hibernation, along with
   their specialized winter diet, may be correlated. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {We present a three-dimensional (3D) digital atlas of a mouse lemur head
   at 60-mum cubic voxel isotropic resolution.  It was constructed from a
   3D proton magnetic resonance image (MRI) acquired at 500 MHz.  It shows
   views of 3D volume-rendering and movies of contiguous 2D plane cuts in
   three orthogonal directions.  This MR data set was acquired using a
   spin-echo pulse sequence under conditions of strong T2 and significant
   diffusion weighting.  Experimental parameters were optimized to provide
   strong intrinsic contrast between gray and white matter.  Familiar
   anatomical structures are clearly identifiable.  Fine fiber tracts,
   laminations of cortices, details of the inner ears, and layering in the
   lateral geniculate nuclei are all visible.  Anatomical identifications
   of structures in representative slices selected from the atlas are
   presented.  We also describe some difficulties and trade-offs
   encountered in microscopic resolution MRI.  We note that this type of
   atlas does not suffer from the spatial distortions and slice
   registration problems introduced by standard histological techniques. 
   Future in vivo longitudinal studies will provide atlases describing in
   detail the development of the primate brain.  (C) 1994 Academic Press,

   subfossil bones, using a non-destructive method, allowed us to obtain

   with Eulemur fulvus, Lemur catta, and Varecia variegata highly repeated
   DNA probes showed that only the Varecia probe gave a positive signal on
   hybridization on the Pachylemur blot. These results indicate that
   Pachylemur must be considered closer to the genus Varecia than to
   Eulemur and Lemur.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {95},

Abstract = {This study describes the molar enamel microstructure of seven lemurid
   primates: Hapalemur griseus, Varecia variegata, Lemur catta, Lemur
   macaco, Lemur fulvus rufus, Lemur fulvus fulvus, and Lemur fulvus
   albifrons. Contrary to earlier accounts, which reported little or no
   prism decussation in lemurid enamel, both Lemur and Varecia molars
   contain a prominent inner layer of decussating prisms (Hunter-Schreger
   bands), in addition to an outer radial prism layer, and a thin,
   nonprismatic enamel surface layer. In contrast, Hapalemur enamel
   consists entirely of radial and, near the surface, nonprismatic enamel.
   In addition, for all species, prism packing patterns differ according to
   depth from the tooth surface, and for all species but Varecia (which
   also has the thinnest enamel of any lemurid), average prism area
   increases from the enamel-dentine junction to the surface; this may be a
   developmental solution to the problem of accommodating a larger outer
   surface area with enamel deposited from a fixed number of cells.
   Finally, contradicting some previous reports, Pattern 1 prisms
   predominate only in the most superficial prismatic enamel. In the deeper
   enamel, prism cross-sections include bath closed (Pattern 1) and
   are-shaped (Pattern 2 or, most commonly, Pattern 3). This sequence of
   depth-related pattern change is repeated in all taxa. It should also be
   emphasized that all taxa can exhibit all three prism patterns in their
   mature enamel. The high degree of quantitative and qualitative variation
   in prism size, shape, and packing suggests that these features should be
   used cautiously in phylogenetic studies.
   Hapalemur is distinguished from the other lemurids by unique, medially
   constricted or rectangular prism cross-sections at an intermediate depth
   and the absence of prism decussation, but, without further assessment of
   character polarity, these differences do not clarify lemurid
   phylogenetic relations. Some characters of enamel microstructure may
   represent synapomorphies of Lemuridae, or of clades within Lemuridae,
   but homoplasy is likely to be common. Homoplasy of enamel characters may
   reflect functional constraints. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Investigations of the floral biology of the traveler's tree (Ravenala
   madagascariensis) and the ecology of the ruffed lemur (Varecia
   variegata), both endemic to the island of Madagascar, suggest a
   plant-pollinator relationship. Ravenala exhibits many specializations
   for visitation by large nonflying animals: inflorescences placed below
   the crown of the plant and easily accessible to arboreal animals; large
   flowers enclosed in tough, protective bracts that require a strong
   pollinator to open; stiff, rodlike styles that withstand the rough
   handling of the visitors; and copious, sucrose-dominant nectar that
   provides a renewable reward for a sizable animal for a long time period.
   Our observations in the field also show that Varecia variegata:
   consistently and almost exclusively visit the flowers of Ravenala; carry
   pollen on their fur between flowers on the same plant and between
   conspecific plants; do not destroy the flowers while obtaining the
   nectar; and appear to be highly dependent on nectar as a food source
   during specific times of the year. The basal phylogenetic position of
   Ravenala in the family Strelitziaceae, as indicated by molecular
   sequence data, and the distribution of reproductive traits in the three
   extant genera are consistent with the hypothesis that pollination by
   nonflying mammals is an archaic system, whereas bird and bat pollination
   are derived.},

Abstract = {To evaluate whether there are age-related differences in the
   characteristics of the circadian system in owl monkeys (Aotus lemurinus
   griseimembra) experiments analysing the resynchronization behaviour, the
   phase response to 3 h-light pulses (LP), and the range of entrainment
   were carried out with 4 young (2-6 years), 5 middle-aged (10-20 years),
   and 3 old (>20 years) animals. Following an 8 h-delay shift of the
   entraining light-dark cycle (LD 12:12; 100/230 lx : 0.2 lx) the monkeys'
   locomotor activity rhythm re-entrained significantly faster than after
   an 8 h-advance shift. While no age-associated differences in time needed
   for re-entrainment (t(r)) could be detected following the delay-shift, a
   difference appeared after the advance-shift with faster re-entrainment
   in the older animals. in a second experiment, the phase-shifting effects
   of 3 h-light pulses of 100 lx and 230 lx, respectively, applied at
   various phases of the circadian activity rhythm free-running in constant
   dim light (LL) of 0.2 lx were tested. In all monkeys greater
   delay-shifts than advance-shifts could be elicited, but the phase
   response curve (PRC) constructed for the young animals showed a
   considerably smaller delay portion than that in old monkeys. For the
   period lengths of the free-running rhythms no age-related differences
   could be established. However, there was a more pronounced tendency to
   rhythm splitting in the young owl monkeys than in the old ones. The
   range of entrainment for LD-cycles with 3 h light (100 lx) and 20-23 h
   darkness (0.2 lx) varied from less than or equal to 23 h (in 1 of 8
   monkeys) to greater than or equal to 26 h (in 3 of 8 monkeys). That it
   was often asymmetrically centered with regard to the individuals' period
   length can be explained from of the shape of the PRC. Age-related
   differences in the range of entrainment of the circadian activity rhythm
   were not found. Taken together the results seem to provide some evidence
   for a closer coupling of circadian oscillators in owl monkeys with
   increasing age.},

Abstract = {Retrospective epidemiologic evaluation of 27 years of colony data
   (1966-1993) from a large breeding center for ruffed lemurs (Varecia
   variegata) was used to quantitatively assess the risk imposed by
   different management variables on reproductive success (littering) and
   infant viability (litter death).  Logistic regression analysis was used,
   both with and without a term to account for extra-binomial variation in
   the data (random effects) associated with repeated assessments of
   individual lemur dams during the study period.  Population-based
   littering rates are defined and shown not to fluctuate substantially
   over time, although the proportion of females given the opportunity to
   breed was drastically reduced in 1986 due to changes in the species
   management strategy and limited breeding center space resources.  No
   management-related factors were found to be associated with littering
   success.  However, young age of dam (odds ratio = 4.3, P = 0.016) and
   housing in natural habitat enclosures (odds ratio = 6.5, P = 0.003)
   significantly predicted complete litter mortality by 48 hr post-partum. 
   Varecia females > 15 years of age (8 dams, 42 observation-years)
   produced 18 litters and 37 infants, 31 of which survived at least 48 hr.
   Use of established epidemiologic methods to analyze data from existing
   colony records should be used to help direct the management of this
   endangered species toward maximally efficient goals, especially in light
   of current conservation resource limitations.  (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {REMOVAL OF THE OLFACTORY BULBS MODIFIES THE GONADAL RESPONSES TO

Abstract = {The sexual activity of the lesser mouse lemur, unlike that of most
   living primates, is clearly dependent on photoperiod. Males responded to
   long daylengths (> 12 h light/day) by rapid testicular development and
   an increase in testosterone levels reaching 65.8 +/- 1.5 ng/ml (n = 12)
   after 3 wk of inductive photoperiod. Levels were maintained unchanged
   until 14 wk of exposure to long photoperiod, when spontaneous gonadal
   regression was observed. Under short daylengths, intact males exhibited
   regressed gonadal function with low plasma concentrations of
   testosterone: 5.4 +/- 1 ng/ml. To investigate the effect of olfactory
   bulb deprivation on gonadal responses to photoperiod, 12 males were
   bulbectomized (BX) during exposure to either long (n = 8, BX1) or short
   (n = 4, BX2) daylengths. In both groups of BX males, responses to long
   or short daylengths were maintained. However, the timing and the
   amplitude of gonadal responses to photoperiod were modified; BX males
   underwent a significant delay in testis development and also had reduced
   testosterone levels (53.3 +/- 2.3 ng/ml and 37.3 +/- 0.9 ng/ml for BX1
   and BX2 groups, respectively). Moreover, BX males did not exhibit
   spontaneous gonadal regression after 14 wk of exposure to long
   daylengths, indicating that the photorefractory state did not appear, at
   least under our experimental conditions. In this primate, olfactory
   bulbs exert an important effect on the neuroendocrinological control of
   reproductive responsiveness to photoperiod.},

Abstract = {The body weight and sexual activity of the male lesser mouse lemur, a
   prosimian primate, undergo cyclic changes that are
   photoperiod-dependent. Exposure to long daylength (LD; 14 h light/day)
   led to sustained sexual activity, fully developed testes and high plasma
   testosterone concentrations (228 +/- 25 nmol/l, n = 10). After 14 weeks
   under LD, a marked decrease in testosterone levels occurred. Gonadal
   regression was completed within 20 weeks under LD without concomitant
   changes in body weight. Exposure to short daylength (SD; 8 h light/day)
   reinforced the sexual quiescence and was associated with a high ponderal
   gain (from 60 to 110 g). However, independent of the date of gonadal
   arrest, the sexual activity of males spontaneously resumed at a fixed
   time after exposure to SD. The testes developed, testosterone
   concentrations increased to 155 nmol/l and the body weight decreased
   (from 110 to 80 g) within 20 weeks under SD exposure. The timing for
   refractoriness appeared very similar under inhibitory and stimulatory
   photoperiods. This is consistent with the hypotesis that the perception
   of a critical daylength is used to regulate the timing of the following
   sexual phase through a mechanism involving photorefractoriness.
   Contrary to cricetid rodents, a direct response to photoperiodic signals
   for both body weight and sexual activity were not prevented by olfactory
   bulb removal in male mouse lemurs. In bulbectomized males (n = 12),
   sexual activity was stimulated by LD and inhibited by SD. Their plasma
   testosterone levels, however, significantly differed from those of
   controls in both photoperiods. Likewise, ponderal cycles remained intact
   but the fattening phase was delayed and reduced. Finally, whereas the
   sexual recrudescence of bulbectomized males occurred under SD with a
   delay of only 24 weeks, spontaneous testicular regression under exposure
   to LD did not appear in our experimental photoperiodic conditions,},

Abstract = {During the breeding season sexually active male mouse lemurs produce a
   trill call used for advertising. The trill call displays a variable,
   high pitched, complex frequency and amplitude modulated acoustical
   structure and is given with a high sound intensity. The different
   sources of its variation in structure and usage have to be determined to
   understand its complex acoustical design and function. We investigated
   the vocal morphology of the trill call of males with known age and
   weight as well as the behavioral context, in order to evaluate sources
   of its variation. Cluster and discriminant analyses revealed that the
   structure of trill calls showed a high degree of individual stereotypy
   in contrast to a high interindividual variability. A set of three
   distinct variables (fundamental frequency of call onset, bandwidth of
   3rd frequency modulation and end frequency of 7th modulation) was
   sufficient to identify individual senders with almost 90 \% probability.
   The structure of the trill call of adult males was independent of age,
   weight and context and was stable over at least one breeding season. Its
   individually distinct call structure and use in relation to social
   status provide the potential for individual recognition and for
   assessing the `'quality'' of a male.},

Abstract = {Microcebus cerebral cortex has been investigated using various technics:
   amyloid beta-A4 protein, alpha-1 antichymotrypsin and ubiquitin
   immunocytochemistry, thioflavin S staining for amyloid deposition and
   Bodian's silver impregnation not only for amyloid plaques but also for
   degenerated neurites; glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
   immunocytochemistry has been also used for astrocytes. Parenchymal
   beta-A4 amyloid is observed to bc deposited in some aged Microcebus
   cerebral cortex in three forms: 1) diffuse plaques of about 100 mum in
   diameter; 2) dense plaques with compact amyloid core which are
   thioflavin-positive; these two types of amyloid plaques (AP) are also
   stained both with the antibodies against alpha1-antichymotrypsin and
   ubiquitin respectively; they are also associated with
   GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes; 3) extensive ribbon-like infiltrations
   enclosing multiple blood vessels. The distribution of the AP using an
   automatic image analyser has showed that the density of the AP in the
   neocortex fluctuates among the different cortical regions. The density
   is respectively up to 16 AP/mm2 in the superior part of the temporal
   lobe and 12 AP/mm2 in the amygdala, 9 AP/mm2 in the prefrontal area of
   the frontal lobe and 11 AP/mm2 in the central area, 10 AP/mm2 in the
   parietal lobe and 5 AP/mm2 in the occipital lobe. The compact AP are
   more often observed in the temporal lobe. In Alzheimer's disease the AP
   are also made of amyloid beta-A4 protein, alpha1-antichymotrypsin and
   ubiquitin. As in Microcebus, in Alzheimer's disease two types of AP are
   observed: the diffuse and the compact AP; the latter are also thioflavin
   S positive. The dense AP are not so numerous as the diffuse AP and the
   density of the AP is greater in the temporal lobe. All these results
   lead to the conclusion that the AP occured in aged Microcebus brain are
   similar in many respects to those found in Alzheimer's disease. So,
   Microcebus murinus, lemurian primate of small size (about 100 g) and
   relatively short life span (up to 12 years), should provide a valid
   animal model for investigation of some principal features of Alzheimer's
   disease.},

Abstract = {Social dominance was analyzed in a group of Lemur macaco over a one-year

   situation, where success was measured as the amount of time in
   possession of the resource (a bottle of fruit juice). Dominance indexes
   during drinking competition were significantly correlated with baseline
   dominance indexes but were not correlated with individual drinking
   success. Adult females were agonistically dominant over all other
   individuals, but were frequently challenged by juveniles of both sexes
   for access to the drinking bottle. In males, there was a significant
   negative correlation between age and dominance indexes during

   species known only from Ile Sainte Marie, but which had not been
   reported for over 150 years. Sight observations and interviews with
   local people were used in this investigation. The only remaining forest
   on laterite soil, Foret de Kalalao, has been severely degraded and is
   now a series of small disjunct blocks. One area of littoral forest,
   Foret d'Ambohidena, is relatively intact. A single obligate forest bird
   is known still to occur on the island. There is a high correlation
   between the specie of birds observed during the reconnaissance and those
   recognized from pictures by local inhabitants of the island On the basis
   of the extent of habitat destruction, the condition of the remaining

   antibodies developed after the six immunization doses. Regardless of
   this fact, the monkeys were challenged intravenously with 10(5) P.
   falciparum blood stage parasites, and the resultant parasitemia was
   followed daily on blood smears. Only one monkey from each of the groups
   immunized using Freund's adjuvant (both experimental and control) was
   protected. In those immunized using aluminum hydroxide, one animal was
   protected in the experimental group, but none were protected in the
   control group. Anti-parasite antibodies developed during the infection,
   but did not correlate with protection and failed to recognize SPf(66)
   peptide in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunization with the
   polymer did not boost natural antibodies present in two of the monkeys
   before the experiment. Low levels of gamma-interferon were produced in
   some animals, but were not correlated with protection.},

Abstract = {Lateral preferences in food reaching and whole-body turning were
   assessed in 24 prosimian primates: 16 galagos (Galago moholi) and 8
   mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). Reach and turn preference in the
   galago were examined using a single testing procedure; separate
   procedures were used to evaluate reach and turn preferences in the mouse
   lemur. The motoric requirements for both species were 1) reach into a
   Plexiglas container with a single hand for a food item and 2) execution
   of a whole-body rotation about the long axis of the body. Twenty-three
   of the subjects tested had a reach preference (15 right, 8 left
   preferent) and 22 a turn preference (1 right and 21 left preferent). No
   correlation between the direction of reach and turn preference was found
   for either species; however an association between right reach
   preference and female gender was found for the galagos. A species
   difference in the strength of lateralization was found, with the more
   bipedal species, the galago, more strongly lateralized in both measures.
   This result supports the hypothesis that the assumption of upright
   posture was an important factor in the phylogenetic development of
   primate lateralization.},

Abstract = {This study examines correlates of reproduction in Lemur mongoz, an
   endangered prosimian primate with a history of poor captive
   reproduction. Male testicular growth and regression were quantified via
   testicular indices (TI). Although TIs could be used to predict male
   breeding condition, they were not indicators of ability to sire
   offspring. Serum estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) concentrations,
   along with vaginal cytology, were used to monitor female reproductive
   cyclicity. E2 and P profiles showed no abnormalities. An elevation of E2
   with low P, approximately one estrous cycle length (31.4 days) prior to
   the onset of fertile cycles, was consistent with the phenomenon of
   ``pseudoestrus{''} observed in other lemur species. The copulatory
   pattern, consisting of thrusting, multiple intromissions, single or
   multiple ejaculations, and no copulatory lock, was more complex than
   expected for an animal with a supposedly monogamous mating system. The
   preference for natural arboreal substrata during copulation suggests
   that enclosure furnishings may influence copulatory behavior. A 30\%
   neonatal mortality rate tempered recent success in breeding L. mongoz at
   the Duke University Primate Center (DUPC). Although infant sex and
   parity of the mother were not predictive of neonatal mortality, mother's
   natal status was, with captive-born females having a 67\% infant
   mortality rate, compared with 15\% in wild-caught females. Based on
   these observations, a number of factors, including housing, behavior,
   and photoperiod, may be relevant to successful captive propagation of L.
   mongoz.},

Abstract = {Recent paleontological expeditions to the Ankarana range of northern
   Madagascar have recovered the partial remains of four individuals of a
   newly recognized extinct lemur, Babakotia radofilai. Craniodental and
   postcranial material serve to identify Babakotia as a member of the
   palaeopropithecids (also including the extinct genera Palaeopropithecus,
   Archaeoindris, and Mesopropithecus). Living indrids form the sister
   group to this fossil clade. The postcranial anatomy indicates that
   Babakotia was a medium-sized (almost-equal-to 15 kg) indroid whose
   inferred positional behaviors were primarily slow climbing and hanging.
   Although it is probable that a leaping component typified the ancestral
   positional repertoire of all Malagasy lemurs, the mosaic nature of the
   locomotor skeleton of Babakotia further suggests that vertical climbing
   and hang-feeding rather than ricochetal leaping were primitive for
   indrids and palaeopropithecids and that the dramatic saltatory
   adaptations of the living indrids postdate the divergence of these two
   lineages.},

   this inactivity is probably related to the low quality diet. Avahi were
   most commonly seen in pairs; the radio-collared male almost always slept
   with a single female and he spent 40\% of the night with her. An infant
   was born to the study pair in August. Range size was 1.4 ha and this

Abstract = {Observations of reproductive behavior in free-ranging Lemur catta were
   carried out during one annual cycle.  Variability in the behavior of
   female ringtailed lemurs during parturition appears to be mainly a
   function of the female's parity and thus her experience.  Females within
   a troop show estrous asynchrony and characteristically mate with more
   than one male.  Females also exhibit proceptive behavior toward and mate
   with some males from other troops and with transferring males.  The
   potential for a male to monopolize mating opportunities during a
   female's short estrous period is therefore limited.  Male mating
   strategies in ringtailed lemurs can be seen as adaptations to female
   mate choice during a highly restricted breeding season.  In this species
   the dominance hierarchy does not break down with regard to the order of
   mating.  The highest ranking male (central male) mates first and shows
   precopulatory guarding and longer postejaculatory guarding, which may
   increase his chances of siring the offspring.  Subsequent mating
   partners have developed various counterstrategies to mitigate mating
   order effects.},

   previously observed in monkeys, the three groups of lemurs showed much
   more attention to the mirror than to a non-reflective surface,
   especially nasal contacts.  Only L. fulvus showed habituation to the
   mirror with successive presentations.  No social behaviours were
   directed towards the reflection, in contrast to descriptions of
   mirror-image reactions in monkeys, and the mirror did not produce an
   effect of social facilitation.  The results suggest that the mirror
   elicits a diminished social reaction in lemurs compared to monkeys,
   perhaps due to the absence of relevant olfactory stimuli.},

   material accumulates in plasmalemma protuberances which are less
   numerous and smaller than the knobs produced by P. falciparum or the

   b) In the sporogony: the small number of subpellicular microtubules
   {[}12/13], their asymmetric arrangement and their extension to a large
   part of the sporozoite length. The presence of tubular cristae with
   ampullar section in the mitochondria and the great length of the

   characteristics of the lemurs' malaria.},

Title = {SIGNIFICANCE OF NONPARAMETRIC LIGHT EFFECTS IN ENTRAINMENT OF
   CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS IN OWL MONKEYS (AOTUS LEMURINUS-GRISEIMEMBRA) BY LIGHT
   DARK CYCLES},
Journal = {CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL},

Pages = {251-266},
Abstract = {In a total of 12 adult Colombian owl monkeys, Aotus lemurinus
   griseimembra, the significance of nonparametric light effects for the
   entrainment of the circadian system by light-dark (LD) cycles was
   studied by carrying out (a) phase-response experiments testing the
   phase-shifting effect of 30-min light pulses (LPs) of 250 lx applied at
   various phases of the free-running circadian activity rhythm (LL 0.2 Ix)
   and (b) synchronization experiments testing the entraining effect of
   24-h single LP photoperiods consisting of 30-min L of 80 Ix and 23.5-h D
   of 0.5 Ix (sP 0.5) and skeleton photoperiods consisting of two 30-min
   LPs of 80 Ix, given against a background illuminance of 0.5 lx either
   symmetrically at 12-h intervals (PP 12:12) or asymmetrically at 9- and
   15-h intervals (PP 9:15). The phase-response characteristics in Aotus,
   as evidenced by the phase-response curve, generally correspond to those
   of nocturnal rodents, proving that this neotropical simian primate
   chronobiologically is a genuine nocturnal species. When free-running
   with a spontaneous period close to 24 h (24.3 +/- 0.1 h), the PP 12:12
   produced entrainment in only two of five owl monkeys, whereas the sP 0.5
   entrained four of them. The PP 9:15, however, brought about stable
   entrainment of the circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, feeding
   activity, and core temperature in all animals tested (n = 8). Changes in
   phase position of the activity time with the endogenous rhythm entrained
   by a PP 12:12, by an sP 0.5, or by a PP 9:15 give evidence that both LPs
   of a skeleton photoperiod contribute to the phase setting of the
   circadian system. When free-running with a considerably lengthened
   spontaneous period (tau greater-than-or-equal-to 25.5 h), even the sP
   0.5 and the PP 9:15 failed to entrain the owl monkeys' circadian
   rhythms, whereas a 24-h photoperiod with a very long LP of 3 h caused
   entrainment. The results indicate that in Aotus lemurinus griseimembra,
   in addition to the nonparametric light effects, parametric light effects
   play a significant role in the entrainment of circadian rhythms by LD
   cycles.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the open-source Subject-Mediated Automatic
   Remote Testing Apparatus (SMARTA) for visual discrimination tasks, which
   aims to streamline and ease data collection, eliminate or reduce
   observer error, increase interobserver agreement, and automate data
   entry without the need for an internet connection. SMARTA is inexpensive
   and easy to build, and it can be modified to accommodate a variety of
   experimental designs. Here we describe the utility and functionality of
   SMARTA in a captive setting. We present the results from a case study of
   color vision in ruffed lemurs (Varecia spp.) at the Duke Lemur Center in
   Durham, North Carolina, in which we demonstrate SMARTA's utility for
   two-choice color discrimination tasks, as well as its ability to
   streamline and standardize data collection. We also include detailed
   instructions for constructing and implementing the fully integrated
   SMARTA touchscreen system.},

Title = {The effect of body mass and diet composition on torpor patterns in a

Abstract = {One of the most obvious physiological changes accompanying seasonal
   heterothermy in mammals is a fattening stage preceding periods of
   resource scarcity. This phenomenon reflects the interplay of both diet
   and physiology. Though the accrual of fat stores is known to be
   essential for overwintering in some species, the influence of diet on
   the physiology of torpor is not fully understood. Results from captive
   studies in heterothermic rodents and marsupials have indicated that when
   autumn diets are enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs),
   animals receiving these diets experience deeper and more frequent torpor
   bouts than their counterparts receiving a control diet. Our study
   investigates this potential effect of dietary composition in animals
   that use daily torpor rather than prolonged torpor (i.e., hibernation).
   In so doing, we investigate the degree to which dietary effects on
   torpor are restricted to cold-adapted rodents and marsupials, or are a
   more general feature of mammalian heterothermy. We examined the effects
   of a PUFA diet and a control diet on the thermoregulation of one of the
   few species of primates known to use daily torpor: the grey mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus). Though the results of this study are largely
   inconclusive regarding the impact of dietary manipulations on torpor
   frequency and duration, we nonetheless find that the propensity of
   animals to enter torpor is directly influenced by age and seasonal
   changes in body mass, and thus reflect important physiological aspects
   of flexible thermoregulatory responses.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Trees in the genus Canarium L. are known to comprise an important
   component of the structure of Madagascar's moist forests, but recent
   work on Canarium in Madagascar reveals that the genus also comprises an
   important part of their diversity as well. To date, published Floras for
   Madagascar have recognized only three taxa of Canarium, but here we
   recognize 33 species, 27 of them new to science; this increases the
   number of accepted species in the genus by 33\% worldwide and
   establishes Madagascar as a primary center of diversity for the genus.
   Despite its name, C. madagascariense Engl. proves to be one of the
   rarest and geographically most restricted species. Most Malagasy
   Canarium species are narrow endemic, and this is consistent with recent
   floristic and taxonomic research in other taxonomic groups on the
   island. The species of Canarium in Madagascar can be distinguished using
   mostly vegetative characters, and this will prove useful to foresters,
   ecologists, and conservationists. Most moist forests in Madagascar
   include multiple species of Canarium, and one important avenue of future
   research will be to further investigate the interdependence of the
   species of Canarium and the frugivorous lemurs that eat the pericarp of
   their fruits and possibly disperse their seeds.},

Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {213-227},
Abstract = {Vomeronasal receptor genes have frequently been invoked as integral to
   the establishment and maintenance of species boundaries among mammals
   due to the elaborate one-to-one correspondence between semiochemical
   signals and neuronal sensory inputs. Here, we report the most extensive
   sample of vomeronasal receptor class 1 (V1R) sequences ever generated
   for a diverse yet phylogenetically coherent group of mammals, the
   tooth-combed primates (suborder Strepsirrhini). Phylogenetic analysis
   confirms our intensive sampling from a single V1R subfamily, apparently
   unique to the strepsirrhine primates. We designate this subfamily as
   V1Rstrep. The subfamily retains extensive repertoires of gene copies
   that descend from an ancestral gene duplication that appears to have
   occurred prior to the diversification of all lemuriform primates
   excluding the basal genus Daubentonia (the aye-aye). We refer to the
   descendent clades as V1Rstrep-alpha and V1Rstrep-beta. Comparison of the
   two clades reveals different amino acid compositions corresponding to
   the predicted ligand-binding site and thus potentially to altered
   functional profiles between the two. In agreement with previous studies
   of the mouse lemur (genus, Microcebus), the majority of V1Rstrep gene
   copies appear to be intact and under strong positive selection,
   particularly within transmembrane regions. Finally, despite the
   surprisingly high number of gene copies identified in this study, it is
   nonetheless probable that V1R diversity remains underestimated in these
   nonmodel primates and that complete characterization will be limited
   until high-coverage assembled genomes are available.},

Abstract = {Sexual selection theory suggests that choice for partners carrying
   dissimilar genes at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) may play
   a role in maintaining genetic variation in animal populations by
   limiting inbreeding or improving the immunity of future offspring.
   However, it is often difficult to establish whether the observed MHC
   dissimilarity among mates drives mate choice or represents a by-product
   of inbreeding avoidance based on MHC-independent cues. Here, we used
   454-sequencing and a 10-year study of wild grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   murinus), small, solitary primates from western Madagascar, to compare
   the relative importance on the mate choice of two MHC class II genes,
   DRB and DQB, that are equally variable but display contrasting patterns
   of selection at the molecular level, with DRB under stronger
   diversifying selection. We further assessed the effect of the genetic
   relatedness and of the spatial distance among candidate mates on the
   detection of MHC-dependent mate choice. Our results reveal inbreeding
   avoidance, along with disassortative mate choice at DRB, but not at DQB.
   DRB-disassortative mate choice remains detectable after excluding all
   related dyads (characterized by a relatedness coefficient r > 0), but
   varies slightly with the spatial distance among candidate mates. These
   findings suggest that the observed deviations from random mate choice at
   MHC are driven by functionally important MHC genes (like DRB) rather
   than passively resulting from inbreeding avoidance and further emphasize
   the need for taking into account the spatial and genetic structure of
   the population in correlative tests of MHC-dependent mate choice.},

Abstract = {Biogeography is the study of life on Earth what kinds exist, what they
   look like and where they are found. Starting with the Age of Discovery
   in the 15th century it became clear to early explorers that plants and
   animals differed from place to place and that certain distribution
   patterns typified certain areas of the planet. Two Europeans who took
   part in global exploration in the 1800's were Charles Darwin who sailed
   around the world on the Beagle (1831-1836) and Alfred Russel Wallace who
   explored South America and Oceanic Asia (1848-1862). Through observation
   of the kinds and distribution of animals on islands, Darwin (Galapagos)
   and Wallace (Indonesia) both arrived at the notion of natural selection
   as the force behind evolution. Biogeographic puzzles still intrigue
   evolutionary biologists today. How do species reach remote places (how
   did lemurs get to Madagascar or platyrrhine monkeys to South America)?
   How does isolation drive evolution to produce the wondrous array of
   biodiversity found on islands and what are the underlying mechanisms?
   Biogeography is at the heart of nearly every major evolutionary event
   ever recorded in the history of the Earth and it is nearly impossible to
   understand those events without its appreciation.},

Abstract = {The lemurs of Madagascar represent a prodigious adaptive radiation. At
   least 17 species ranging from 11 to 160 kg have become extinct during
   the past 2000 years. The effect of this loss on contemporary lemurs is
   unknown. The concept of competitive release favours the expansion of
   living species into vacant niches. Alternatively, factors that triggered
   the extinction of some species could have also reduced community-wide
   niche breadth. Here, we use radiocarbon and stable isotope data to
   examine temporal shifts in the niches of extant lemur species following
   the extinction of eight large-bodied species. We focus on southwestern
   Madagascar and report profound isotopic shifts, both from the time when
   now-extinct lemurs abounded and from the time immediately following
   their decline to the present. Unexpectedly, the past environments
   exploited by lemurs were drier than the protected (albeit often
   degraded) riparian habitats assumed to be ideal for lemurs today.
   Neither competitive release nor niche contraction can explain these
   observed trends. We develop an alternative hypothesis: ecological
   retreat, which suggests that factors surrounding extinction may force
   surviving species into marginal or previously unfilled niches.},

Title = {Dietary Choices by Four Captive Slender Lorises (Loris tardigradus) When

Abstract = {The slender loris (Loris tardigradus) is a rare, nocturnal prosimian
   found only in the tropical rainforest of southern India and Sri Lanka.
   Little is known about their diet, though it is assumed that insects
   comprise a majority of their wild diet. Based on this assumption,
   captive lorises are offered a variety of insects or insect life stages;
   the species of insect or the life stage is often determined by what is
   easiest to buy or rear. Captive lorises at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC)
   were offered the opportunity to choose which life stage of mealworms
   (Tenebrio molito), superworms (Zophobus morio), or waxworms (Galleria
   mellonella) they preferred. The DLC captive lorises did not select the
   largest life stages of any insect offered. They preferred the larvae
   stage to the adult stage in all three insect species, and males and
   females had different insect species and life stage preferences. Zoo

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Studies of chemical signals in vertebrates typically target single
   species; however, a broader understanding of olfactory communication may
   derive from comparative studies. We collected urine from 12 species
   representing most families of strepsirrhine primates - an excellent
   model clade because of variation in scent marking and socioecology.
   Using SPDE/GC-MS, we identified the volatile chemical composition of
   male and female urine from six `urine marking' species and six glandular
   or `non-urine marking' species. We found no sex differences, but as
   predicted, urine markers expressed the most chemically complex and
   distinctive urine. More distantly related species had more dissimilar
   urinary profiles, suggesting gradual signal evolution. Reconstructing
   ancestral chemical profiles revealed different evolutionary trajectories
   for urine and non-urine markers. We suggest that urine marking is an
   ancestral behaviour related to solitary, nocturnal living and that
   parallel evolutionary shifts towards greater reliance on derived
   glandular marking occurred in a family (Lemuridae) characterized by
   diurnality and sociality.},

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {82},
Number = {4-5},
Pages = {212-223},
Abstract = {We investigated whether or not habitat structure contributes to the
   separation of two sister species of lemurs and their hybrids. For this,
   we studied Microcebus murinus and M. griseorufus along a continuous
   vegetation gradient where populations of the two species occur in
   sympatry or in allopatry. In allopatry, the two species are generalists
   without any sign of microhabitat selectivity. In sympatry, both species
   differed significantly and discriminated against certain habitat
   structures: M. murinus was found in microhabitats with larger trees than
   average while M. griseorufus utilized microhabitats with smaller trees.
   Hybrids between the two species did not show any significant
   discrimination for or against microhabitat structure and did not differ
   in their habitat utilization from either parent species. Both species
   can go into torpor and hibernation. M. griseorufus is seen more
   frequently during the cool dry season than M. murinus. We assume that M.
   murinus goes into extended torpor or hibernation more frequently than M.
   griseorufus. We interpret the different occurrence of large-sized trees
   in microhabitats of M. murinus as a prerequisite for M. murinus to be
   able to spend extended periods of time in tree holes that are isolated
   and allow hibernation at reduced temperature levels. Copyright (C) 2012

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the pattern of
   coordinations of the hindlimb joints in the world's smallest living
   primate (Microcebus murinus). The sequencing and timing of joint
   rotations have been analyzed in five adult males performing maximal
   leaping from a take-off immobile platform to their own wooden nest.
   Angular kinematics of hip, knee, angle and metatarso-phalangeal (MT)
   joints were deduced from high-speed X-ray films in the sagittal plane of
   the animals. The body mass center (BMC) of the lemurs was assimilated to
   their iliac crest. The maximal airborne performance of the lemurs was
   0.33 +/- 0.04. m, which represented 2.55 +/- 0.36 times their snout-vent
   length. Take-off instant occurred 72 +/- 7 ms after the start of the
   push-off, with a BMC velocity of 3.23 +/- 0.48 m s(-1), oriented 55 +/-
   14 deg. with the horizontal plane. The kinematic analysis of the joints
   and musculotendon architecture of the M. murinus plantar flexors pointed
   out mechanical power amplifier mechanisms (i.e. stretch-shortening cycle
   of hindlimb muscles and proximo-to-distal sequence).},

Abstract = {Spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported as a relatively
   common neoplasm in prosimians; however, the cause is unknown. To
   investigate possible pathogenic mechanisms, the authors performed a
   review of all adult animals from a captive prosimian population that had
   postmortem examinations over the past 10 years. They performed a
   detailed histologic evaluation of all suspected proliferative liver
   lesions and diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma in 14 of 145 lemurs
   (9.7\%). Affected animals ranged between the ages of 6 and 40 years old.
   The tumors had an unusually aggressive growth pattern for animal
   species; metastasis to the lungs or mediastinum was evident in 7 of 14
   animals. Thirty-one animals-9 with hepatocellular carcinomas and 22
   age-matched controls without hepatic neoplasia were tested to evaluate
   the relationship between hepatic iron stores (as well as other trace
   metals) and the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma. There was no
   difference between the hepatic iron, copper, or molybdenum in lemurs
   with hepatocellular carcinoma and those without, suggesting that iron is
   not a key element in the pathogenesis of liver tumor formation. Analysis
   of 22 serum samples from animals with and without liver tumors indicated
   no evidence of active infection with a hepadnavirus, the virus family
   that includes hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis C virus and aflatoxin BI were
   considered as potential causes and ruled out owing to lack of associated
   histopathologic lesions. In conclusion, hepatocellular neoplasia is
   relatively common in captive prosimians, although previously suspected
   etiologies seem unlikely.},

Title = {Whole brain mapping of glutamate distribution in adult and old primates
   at 11.7T},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {251},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Glutamate is the amino acid with the highest cerebral concentration. It
   plays a central role in brain metabolism. It is also the principal
   excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and is involved in multiple
   cognitive functions. Alterations of the glutamatergic system may
   contribute to the pathophysiology of many neurological disorders. For
   example, changes of glutamate availability are reported in rodents and
   humans during Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, epilepsy as well as
   during aging. Most studies evaluating cerebral glutamate have used
   invasive or spectroscopy approaches focusing on specific brain areas.
   Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer imaging of glutamate (gluCEST) is
   a recently developed imaging technique that can be used to study
   relative changes in glutamate distribution in the entire brain with
   higher sensitivity and at higher resolution than previous techniques. It
   thus has strong potential clinical applications to assess glutamate
   changes in the brain. High field is a key condition to perform gluCEST
   images with a meaningful signal to noise ratio. Thus, even if some
   studies started to evaluate gluCEST in humans, most studies focused on
   rodent models that can be imaged at high magnetic field. In particular,
   systematic characterization of gluCEST contrast distribution throughout
   the whole brain has never been performed in humans or non-human
   primates. Here, we characterized for the first time the distribution of
   the gluCEST contrast in the whole brain and in large-scale networks of
   mouse lemur primates at 11.7 Tesla. Because of its small size, this
   primate can be imaged in high magnetic field systems. It is widely
   studied as a model of cerebral aging or Alzheimer's disease. We observed
   high gluCEST contrast in cerebral regions such as the nucleus accumbens,

Title = {Marking Versus Overmarking: Spatial and Behavioral Patterns of Scent
   Marking in Wild Diademed Sifaka (Propithecus diadema)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Abstract = {In mammals, olfactory communication plays an essential role in
   territorial and mating dynamics. Scent depositions in various species,
   including lemurs, can be placed via marking or overmarking (marking over
   previous depositions). We focused on the role that marking and
   overmarking play in territorial defence and intrasexual competition. We
   investigated these aspects in diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema) in
   the primary rainforest of Maromizaha (eastern Madagascar). We collected
   scent marking data for five groups from April to November 2018 and from
   May to December 2019. We aimed to understand whether the lemurs
   deposited scent marks homogeneously across the home range and whether
   sex, rank, and occurrence of intergroup encounters affected the lemur's
   deposition rate. We also asked whether males overmarked adult females
   more often than other depositions, and the marking and overmarking rates
   changed between the migration and non-migration seasons. We found that
   scent marking was performed higher in peripheral and overlapping areas
   than in the home range central areas. In addition, males had higher
   scent marking rates, but intergroup encounters did not affect deposition
   rates. Males showed higher rates of overmarking and primarily targeted
   dominant females' depositions, particularly during the ``migration{''}
   season (including premating and mating seasons). Our findings suggest a
   border-marking strategy in Propithecus diadema. More frequent scent
   marking in the ``migration{''} season suggests intrasexual competition
   in males. Our results suggest that marking is associated with
   territorial and resource defence, suggesting that it plays a role in
   monopolizing females using a mate-guarding strategy and may also serve
   for males' self-advertisement to females and subordinate depositors.},

Title = {Structure of Microhabitats Used by Microcebus rufus Across a

Abstract = {Microhabitat preference among primates, which provides them with the
   niche they need to survive, often conditions primate diversity,
   abundance, and coexistence. Vegetation alteration and recovery have
   built heterogeneous forest landscapes that may influence primates'
   microhabitat preferences. We compared the diversity and size of
   trees/shrubs and the presence of lianas in 132 sites where we captured
   the rufous mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus), with that of 240 sites where
   we did not capture this species, to investigate the aspects of
   microhabitat structure they might prefer. We then examined how this
   structural preference varies across a heterogeneous landscape of forests
   with different disturbance levels. Overall, microhabitats used by M.
   rufus differed significantly from unused ones in densities of small
   size, understory, and midstory plants. Microcebus rufus frequented
   microhabitats with significantly denser small- and medium-size (diameter
   at breast height {[}DBH] 2.5-10 cm) trees/shrubs without lianas in the
   primary forest, and small-size plants (DBH 2.5-4.9 cm) with one liana in
   other forest types. Compared to the microhabitats they used in the
   primary forest, the microhabitats in other forest types had lower
   densities of trees/shrubs with lianas. Additionally, the secondary
   forests and forest fragments also had significantly lower DBH. Although
   this variation in microhabitat use may represent an opportunity for M.
   rufus to live in disturbed habitats, it may expose them to additional
   threats, affecting their long-term survival. These findings emphasize
   the need to examine potential changes in microhabitat use among primates
   living in anthropogenic landscapes, which could help optimize long-term
   conservation and management of threatened primate species in
   heterogeneous landscapes.},

Title = {Sex and age-specific survival and life expectancy in a free ranging

Volume = {88},

Abstract = {The critically endangered indri (Indri indri) is the largest extant
   lemur species and its population size is projected to decline over the
   next three generations due to habitat loss, hunting and climate change.
   Accurate information on the demographic parameters driving the
   population dynamics of indri is urgently needed to help decision-making
   regarding the conservation of this iconic species. We monitored and
   followed the life histories of 68 individually recognizable indris in 10
   family groups in the Maromizaha New Protected Area (Madagascar) for 12
   years. We estimated age and sex-specific survival trajectories using a
   Bayesian hierarchical survival model and found that the survival curves
   for male and female indris show a similar pattern, consistent with what
   found typically in primates; i.e., a high infant mortality rate which
   declines with age in the juvenile phase and increases again for adults.
   Also, life expectancies at 2 years of age (e2), were found to be similar
   between the sexes (e2 females = 7.8 years; e2 males = 7.5 years). We
   suggest that the lack of strong differences in the survival patterns for
   male and female indris are related to the strictly monogamous mating
   system and the lack of sexual dimorphism in this species. Our study
   provides, for the first time, robust estimates for demographic
   parameters of indris and one of the very few datasets on survival
   trajectories available for primates.},

Title = {LMTK3 promotes tumorigenesis in bladder cancer via the ERK/MAPK pathway},

Abstract = {Lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) is a key member of the serine-threonine
   tyrosine kinase family. It plays an important role in breast cancer
   tumorigenesis and progression. However, its biological role in bladder
   cancer remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that LMTK3 was
   overexpressed in bladder cancer and was positively correlated with
   bladder cancer malignancy. High LMTK3 expression predicted poor overall
   survival. Knockdown of LMTK3 in bladder cancer cells triggered
   cell-cycle arrest at G2/M phase, suppressed cell growth, and induced
   cell apoptosis in bladder cancer cells. Furthermore, Transwell assays
   revealed that reduction of LMTK3 decreased cell migration by regulating
   the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition pathway. Conversely, LKTM3
   overexpression was shown to promote proliferation and migration of
   bladder cancer cells. We assessed phosphorylation of MEK and ERK1/2 in
   bladder cancer cells depleted of LMTK3 and demonstrated a reduced
   phosphorylation status compared with the control group. Using an MAPK
   signaling-specific inhibitor, U0126, we could rescue the promotion of
   proliferation and viability in LMTK3-overexpressing cells. In
   conclusion, we extend the status of LMTK3 as an oncogene in bladder
   cancer and provide evidence for its function via the activation of the
   ERK/MAPK pathway. Thus, targeting LMTK3 may hold potential as a
   diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and as a possible future treatment
   for bladder cancer.},

Title = {Abiotic Factors Affecting the Cathemeral Activity ofEulemur fulvusin the

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},

Abstract = {Cathemeral primates perform significant amounts of activity during the
   daylight and dark portions of the 24-h cycle. Most brown lemurs have
   been reported to be cathemeral. A previous study reported that brown
   lemurs in Ankarafantsika National Park (ANP) shift their activity
   pattern from being cathemeral in the dry season to being diurnal in the
   wet season. From July 2015 to March 2016, we collected data on active
   behaviour of brown lemurs over 46 full-day and 33 full-night
   observations, distributed evenly between the dry and wet seasons. This
   study examined the abiotic factors that potentially allow this seasonal
   shift from cathemeral to diurnal activity. We analysed the effects of
   day length (time from sunrise to sunset), nocturnal luminosity, and
   climatic factors on the diurnal and nocturnal activities of the brown
   lemurs in ANP using generalized linear mixed models. We found that the
   brown lemurs were cathemeral regardless of season. Their diurnal
   activity increased with increasing day length and at high humidity, but
   decreased on days of high temperature and low lunar luminosity. Their
   nocturnal activity increased with decreasing day length, during bright
   nights, at low temperature, and at low humidity. Their diurnal and
   nocturnal activities decreased during heavy rainfall. These data
   indicate that the photoperiodic variation entrained their activity
   rhythm. Bright nights may provide better visibility, advantageous for
   the detection of predators and food, although it may increase exposure
   to predators. The modification of activity level with temperature
   variation can be a behavioural thermoregulation. The high humidity
   during the wet season probably reduced evaporative cooling, inducing
   increased body temperature and stimulating water foraging as a potential
   response to dehydration and active heat dissipation. Investigation on
   physiological responses to environmental factors is needed to fully
   understand cathemerality in lemurs. These findings emphasize the
   flexibility of diurnal and nocturnal activity level of brown lemurs
   according to the great seasonal variation in tropical dry forests.},

Abstract = {Objectives Phylogenies consistently group the folivorousLepilemurspecies
   with the small-bodied insectivorous-frugivorous cheirogaleids. Juvenile
   lepilemurs and adult cheirogaleids share allometries in most aspects of
   skull morphology, except the palate. We investigated potential
   influences on palate shape in these taxa and several outgroups using
   geometric morphometrics. Materials and Methods Our sample included
   representatives of four extant strepsirrhine families, Cheirogaleidae
   (including Lepilemurinae), Lemuridae, Indriidae, and Galagidae, and one
   subfossilMegaladapis. Our dataset comprised 32 landmarks collected from
   397 specimens representing 15 genera and 28 species, and was analyzed
   using generalized procrustes analyses and between group principal
   component analysis. We explored the influence of size, phylogeny, diet,
   and the propagation of loud vocalizations on palate shape. Results While
   congeneric species clustered within the morphospace, the
   phylomorphospace did not mirror molecular phylogenetic hypotheses of
   higher-order relationships. Four palate forms were distinguished within
   the Cheirogaleidae. Diet, strongly linked to body size, had the single
   greatest influence on palate shape. The production of long-distance
   advertisement calls was most often associated with positive scores on
   the PC1 axis. Discussion Our results suggest that the extensive
   variation in palate shape among Cheirogaleidae is related to dietary
   shifts that accompanied changes in body size during the clade's
   radiation. Molecular phylogenies indicate that cheirogaleid
   diversification involved repeated dwarfing events, which in turn drove
   dietary shifts from ancestral folivory-frugivory to frugivory,
   gummivory, and faunivory in the descendant species. The
   elongatedLepilemurpalate is probably related to accelerated eruption of
   the cheek teeth to render juveniles competent to shear leaves upon
   weaning.},

Abstract = {Steadily aging populations result in a growing need for research
   regarding age-related brain alterations and neurodegenerative
   pathologies. By allowing a good translation of results to humans,
   nonhuman primates, such as the gray mouse lemur Microcebus murinus, have
   gained attention in this field. Our aim was to examine correlations
   between atrophy-induced brain alterations and age, with special focus on
   sex differences in mouse lemurs. For cerebral volumetric measurements,
   in vivo magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 59 animals (28
   female female/31 male male) aged between 1.0 to 11.9 years. Volumes of
   different brain regions, cortical thicknesses, and ventricular
   expansions were evaluated. Analyses revealed significant brain atrophies
   with increasing age, particularly around the caudate nucleus, the
   thalamus, and frontal, parietal, and temporo-occipital regions.
   Especially old females showed a strong decline in cingulate cortex
   thickness and had higher values of ventricular expansion, whereas
   cortical thickness of the splenium and occipital regions decreased
   mainly in males. Our study, thus, provides first evidence for
   sex-specific, age-related brain alterations in a nonhuman primate,
   suggesting that mouse lemurs can help elucidating the mechanism
   underlying sex disparities in cerebral aging, for which there is mixed
   evidence in humans. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Exploring Social Dominance in Wild Diademed Sifakas (Propithecus
   diadema): Females Are Dominant, but It Is Subtle and the Benefits Are
   Not Clear},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},

Abstract = {Rarely observed in mammals, female dominance is documented in several of
   Madagascar's lemurs. Although dominance affects many aspects of
   primates' lives, studies have largely focused on dyadic agonistic
   interactions to characterise relationships. We explored the power
   structure of three diademed sifaka groups (Propithecus diadema) at
   Tsinjoarivo during the lean season (July-August, 325 h) using social
   behaviours, group leadership, displacements and feeding outcomes. Two
   groups had a hierarchy dominated by the breeding female, while the
   highest rank was held by the breeding male in the third; in dyadic
   interactions, breeding females dominated males in all groups.
   Inconsistencies in hierarchies suggest that groups vary, with rank
   related to kinship ties of breeders. Aggression and grooming were rare;
   adult females received aggression at lower frequencies than males. Group
   movements were led more by females and followed more by males, and
   female feeding priority was evident in displacements during feeding.
   However, males and females did not differ in feeding outcomes, as
   expected (particularly in the lean season) if female dominance (and/or
   male deference) serves to ensure better access for females. This
   unexpected pattern (female dominance despite rare aggression, clear
   female leadership and displacement, yet no observable benefit in
   grooming or feeding outcomes) defies easy explanation, and reinforces
   the fact that studies examining female power in lemurs should take a
   multifaceted approach. Further study is needed to understand this
   pattern, the physiological and reproductive consequences of female
   dominance (e.g. detecting subtler variation in food quality or intake
   rates) and exactly how (and when) the benefits of female dominance are
   manifested.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {Mouse lemurs are small, nocturnal, arboreal solitary foragers and are
   endemic primates of Madagascar. This lifestyle and their high predation
   risk can explain why mouse lemurs rely heavily on olfaction for
   intraspecific communication. As they often use urine for this purpose,
   we investigated dichloromethane extracts of the urine of two mouse lemur
   species, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) and the Godman's
   mouse lemur (M. lehilahytsara), using gas-chromatography-mass
   spectrometry. We detected 977 different volatile compounds of different
   compound classes in 22 urine extracts obtained from nine M. murinus
   (four males, five females) and nine M. lehilahytsara (three males, six
   females) individuals. We compared the volatile profiles of the sexes and
   species using principal component analyses and discriminant function
   analyses and detected a significant difference in the urinary profiles
   of males and females and in the profiles of M. murinus and M.
   lehilahytsara. These very complex sex- and species-specific signatures
   could be used for distance communication in the context of species
   recognition, for mate search and in male-male competition. Our study
   provides important mechanistic insights into complex chemical signaling
   pathways in primates that are mirrored, in the case of mouse lemurs, by
   their extraordinarily rich repertoire of olfactory receptors. The
   production of highly informative olfactory signals may be complementing
   the complex acoustic signaling system of these solitary foragers
   suggesting the existence of a multimodal communication network that
   should be highly beneficial for any species living in dispersed social
   networks.},

Abstract = {Infanticide has been observed across many primate taxa, but the extent
   of its occurrence is not fully understood due to difficulty in
   observation and uneven reporting. Several hypotheses have been proposed
   to explain why infanticide occurs in primates and whether it benefits
   some individuals within a social group. Here we report on a case of
   infanticide, followed by partial consumption of the infant, in a
   population of Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) at Mariarano,
   Northwest Madagascar. We witnessed an adult male sifaka kill and consume
   part of an infant, a member of his own social group, as well as the
   mother's reaction to the infanticide. Following the infanticide, the
   mother of the deceased infant left the social group after repeated
   agonistic encounters with the other group members. We evaluate how this
   event relates to the predictions of four common hypotheses. Further
   research on Coquerel's sifaka is needed to determine the frequency of
   infanticide in this species, and in lemurs more generally, because
   infanticide is currently poorly understood in this taxon.},

Abstract = {Acoustic phenotypic variation is of major importance for speciation and
   the evolution of species diversity. Whereas selective and stochastic
   forces shaping the acoustic divergence of signaling systems are well
   studied in insects, frogs, and birds, knowledge on the processes driving
   acoustic phenotypic evolution in mammals is limited. We quantified the
   acoustic variation of a call type exchanged during agonistic encounters
   across eight distinct species of the smallest-bodied nocturnal primate
   radiation, the Malagasy mouse lemurs. The species live in two different
   habitats (dry forest vs. humid forest), differ in geographic distance to
   each other, and belong to four distinct phylogenetic clades within the
   genus. Genetically defined species were discriminated reliably on the
   phenotypic level based on their acoustic distinctiveness in a
   discriminant function analysis. Acoustic variation was explained by
   genetic distance, whereas differences in morphology, forest type, or
   geographic distance had no effect. The strong impact of genetics was
   supported by a correlation between acoustic and genetic distance and the
   high agreement in branching pattern between the acoustic and molecular
   phylogenetic trees. In sum, stochastic factors such as genetic drift
   best explained acoustic diversification in a social communication call
   of mouse lemurs.},

Abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation drive the worldwide depletion of
   biodiversity. Although it is known that anthropogenic disturbances
   severely affect host and ecosystem integrity, effects on parasites are
   largely understudied. This study aims to investigate if and how habitat
   fragmentation affects the composition of ectoparasite communities on
   small mammalian hosts in two networks of dry deciduous forest fragments
   in northwestern Madagascar. Forest sites differing in size, proportion
   of edge habitat and host density were studied in the Ankarafantsika
   National Park and in the Mariarano region. A total of 924 individuals of
   two mouse lemur species, Microcebus murinus (n = 200) and Microcebus
   ravelobensis (n = 426), and two rodent species, endemic Eliurus myoxinus
   (n = 114) and introduced Rattus rattus (n = 184), were captured to
   assess ectoparasite infestations. Ectoparasite prevalence and
   ectoparasite species richness were statistically related to nine
   ecological variables applying generalized linear mixed models. Hosts
   harbored ticks (Haemaphysalis microcebi), mites (Schoutedenichia
   microcebi, Listrophoroides spp., Laelaptidae gen. spp.) and sucking lice
   (Lemurpediculus spp., Polyplax sp., Hoplopleuridae gen. sp.). Parasite
   prevalence differed significantly between host species for all detected
   parasite taxa. Proximity to the forest edge led to a significant
   reduction in ectoparasites. Parasite-specific edge effects were observed
   up to a distance of 750 m from the forest edge. The obtained results
   imply that habitat fragmentation impacts ectoparasite communities, in
   particular by negatively affecting temporary parasite species. The
   results are best explained by an interplay of parasite life cycles,
   responses to changes in abiotic factors induced by edges and
   host-specific responses to habitat fragmentation. The negative responses
   of most studied ectoparasite taxa to forest edges and habitat
   fragmentation demonstrate their ecological vulnerability that may
   eventually threaten the integrity of ecosystems and potentially impact
   ectoparasite biodiversity worldwide. (C) 2020 Australian Society for

Title = {The ghost fruits of Madagascar: Identifying dysfunctional seed dispersal
   in Madagascar's endemic flora},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {242},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Madagascar lost a large number of large-bodied animal species during the
   Holocene. Many of them played important roles as seed dispersers. In the
   case of the largest-seeded species, giant lemurs or elephant birds may
   have been the sole dispersers because no extant frugivore has a gape
   size large enough to ingest those seeds. These plant species now show
   all the hallmarks of anachronistic species. The consequences of
   dispersal gaps caused by megafaunal extinctions are exacerbated by the
   continuing decline of the range distribution of extant dispersers,
   particularly lemurs. In this paper, we identify dispersal gaps in
   Madagascar and highlight dysfunctional seed dispersal - systems in which
   plants have lost animal mutualists. We obtained data on seed dispersal,
   traits and distribution of plants and frugivores in Madagascar from the
   literature, online databases, and using herbarium specimens. We
   estimated the number of potential dispersers for each endemic
   endozoochorous plant species, by comparing the seed size of each plant
   species to the size of the largest seed that each frugivore can swallow
   whole. We estimated the number of available lemur dispersers by matching
   the distribution of plant species to the distribution of potential
   dispersers. We found that, out of the 3018 studied endozoochorous plant
   species, two species have experienced the complete extinction of their
   main dispersers while 487 species suffer from the local extinction of
   their suitable dispersers. A limited number of dispersers could be one
   of the main reasons why most of these plant species are now on the edge
   of extinction.},

Title = {Profiling torpor-responsive microRNAs in muscles of the hibernating
   primate Microcebus murinus},
Journal = {BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {1863},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {When food scarcity is coupled with decreased temperatures, gray mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus murinus) depress their metabolic rates and retreat
   into bouts of either daily torpor or multi-day hibernation, without
   dramatically dropping body temperatures like other `traditional
   hibernators'. Rapid and reversible mechanisms are required to coordinate
   the simultaneous suppression of energetically expensive processes and
   activation of pro-survival pathways critical for successful
   torpor-arousal cycling. MicroRNAs, a class of endogenous non-coding
   small RNAs, are effective post-transcriptional regulators that modulate
   all aspects of cellular function. The present study hypothesizes that
   miRNAs are intimately involved in facilitating the molecular
   reorganization events necessary for lemur skeletal muscle torpor. Small
   RNA-Sequencing was used to compare miRNA profiles from skeletal muscles
   of torpid and control primates. We characterized 234 conserved miRNAs,
   of which 20 were differentially expressed during torpor, relative to
   control. Examples included downregulation of key muscle-specific
   (myomiR) members, miR-1 and miR-133, suggesting a switch to
   muscle-specific energy-saving strategies. In silico target mapping and
   logistic regression-based gene set analysis indicated the inhibition of
   energy costly pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation and muscle
   proliferation. The suppression of these metabolic pathways was balanced
   with a lack of miRNA inhibition of various signaling pathways, such as
   MAPK, mTOR, focal adhesion, and ErbB. This study identifies unique miRNA
   signatures and `biomarkers of torpor' that provide us with
   primate-specific insights on torpor at high body temperatures that can
   be exploited for human biomedical concerns.},

Title = {Fecal contamination, parasite risk, and waterhole use by wild animals in
   a dry deciduous forest},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {73},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Waterholes are critically important to animal survival in dry habitats
   but are also a potential source of parasite exposure. Avoiding feces may
   effectively reduce parasite transmission risk, but may also impose
   costs, including greater travel distances to locate less contaminated
   resources. We studied factors influencing wild, water-dependent
   red-fronted lemurs' (Eulemur rufifrons) selection of waterholes,
   including factors related to trade-offs between energy expenditure and
   parasite avoidance. Research took place in a dry deciduous forest in
   western Madagascar characterized by water scarcity during a pronounced
   local dry season. We tested whether fecal contamination influenced
   lemurs' water selection with an experiment that gave lemurs a choice
   between clean and fecally contaminated water disinfected by boiling. We
   also monitored lemurs' use of natural waterholes to determine how
   conspecific fecal contamination and travel distance influenced lemurs'
   use of waterholes. Red-fronted lemurs displayed a strong preference for
   clean water in the experiment. At natural waterholes, we found a
   significant negative interaction between frequency of previous lemur
   visits and fecal contamination, and a longer return time to waterholes
   with increasing fecal contamination, revealing that lemurs returned to
   less contaminated waterholes more frequently and sooner. We also found
   that lemurs prioritized shorter travel distances over feces avoidance.
   Together, these results suggest that red-fronted lemurs exercised their
   preferences for avoiding parasite risk in their natural waterhole
   choices by avoiding highly contaminated waterholes, especially when
   waterholes were equidistant. Thus, fecal contamination and travel
   distance influence water selection in water-scarce habitats, with
   potential impacts on habitat use and ecological interactions.},

Title = {Eulerian videography technology improves classification of sleep
   architecture in primates},
Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {60},
Number = {5},
Pages = {467-475},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Sleep is a critically important dimension of primate behavior, ecology,
   and evolution, yet primate sleep is under-studied because current
   methods of analyzing sleep are expensive, invasive, and time-consuming.
   In contrast to electroencephalography (EEG) and actigraphy, videography
   is a cost-effective and non-invasive method to study sleep architecture
   in animals. With video data, however, it is challenging to score subtle
   changes that occur in different sleep states, and technology has lagged
   behind innovations in EEG and actigraphy. Here, we applied Eulerian
   videography to magnify pixels relevant to scoring sleep from video, and
   then compared these results to analyses based on actigraphy and standard
   infrared videography. We studied four species of lemurs (Eulemur
   coronatus, Lemur catta, Propithecus coquereli, Varecia rubra) for 12-h
   periods per night, resulting in 6480 1-min epochs for analysis. Cramer's
   V correlation between actigraphy-classified sleep and infrared
   videography-classified sleep revealed consistent results in eight of the
   nine 12-h videos scored. A sample of the infrared videography was then
   processed by Eulerian videography for movement magnification and
   re-coded. A second Cramer's V correlation analysis, between two
   independent scorers coding the same Eulerian-processed video, found that
   interobserver agreement among Eulerian videography increased sleep vs.
   awake, NREM, and REM classifications by 7.1\%, 46.7\%, and 34.3\%,
   respectively. Furthermore, Eulerian videography was more strongly
   correlated with actigraphy data when compared to results from standard
   infrared videography. The increase in agreement between the two scorers
   indicates that Eulerian videography has the potential to improve the
   identification of sleep states in lemurs and other primates, and thus to
   expand our understanding of sleep architecture without the need for EEG.},

Abstract = {The extent to which Madagascar's Holocene extinct lemurs fell victim to
   nonhuman predators is poorly understood. Madagascar's Holocene predator
   guild included several now-extinct species, i.e., crocodiles,
   carnivorans, and raptors. Here we focus on mammalian carnivory,
   specifically the roles of Cryptoprocta spelea and its still-extant but
   smaller-bodied sister taxon, C. ferox, the fosa. Cryptoprocta spelea was
   the largest carnivoran on Madagascar during the Quaternary. We ask
   whether some extinct lemurs exceeded the upper prey-size limits of C.
   spelea. We use univariate and multivariate phylogenetic generalized
   least squares regression models to re-evaluate the likely body mass of
   C. spelea. Next, we compare characteristics of the forelimb bones of C.
   ferox and C. spelea to those of other stealth predators specializing on
   small, mixed, and large-bodied prey. Finally, we examine humeri, femora,
   crania, and mandibles of extinct lemurs from six sites in four
   ecoregions of Madagascar to identify damage likely made by predators. We
   test the relative prevalence of carnivory by mammals, raptors, and
   crocodiles at different sites and ecoregions. Our data reveal that
   crocodiles, raptors, and the largest of Madagascar's mammalian
   predators, C. spelea, all preyed on large lemurs. Cryptoprocta
   opportunistically consumed lemurs weighing up to similar to 85kg. Its
   forelimb anatomy would have facilitated predation on large-bodied prey.
   Social hunting may have also enhanced the ability of C. spelea to
   capture large, arboreal primates. Cryptoprocta carnivory is well
   represented at cave and riverine sites and less prevalent at lake and
   marsh sites, where crocodylian predation dominates.},

Title = {LMTK2 binds to kinesin light chains to mediate anterograde axonal

   disease brains},

Abstract = {Cyclin dependent kinase-5 (cdk5)/p35 is a neuronal kinase that regulates
   key axonal and synaptic functions but the mechanisms by which it is
   transported to these locations are unknown. Lemur tyrosine kinase-2
   (LMTK2) is a binding partner for p35 and here we show that LMTK2 also
   interacts with kinesin-1 light chains (KLC1/2). Binding to KLC1/2
   involves a C-terminal tryptophan/aspartate (WD) motif in LMTK2 and the
   tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains in KLC1/2, and this interaction
   facilitates axonal transport of LMTK2. Thus, siRNA loss of KLC1 or
   mutation of the WD motif disrupts axonal transport of LMTK2. We also
   show that LMTK2 facilitates the formation of a complex containing KLC1
   and p35 and that siRNA loss of LMTK2 disrupts axonal transport of both
   p35 and cdk5. Finally, we show that LMTK2 levels are reduced in
   Alzheimer's disease brains. Damage to axonal transport and altered
   cdk5/p35 are pathogenic features of Alzheimer's disease. Thus, LMTK2
   binds to KLC1 to direct axonal transport of p35 and its loss may
   contribute to Alzheimer's disease.},

Abstract = {Scent marking is a well-established, but highly variable, mode of
   communication among strepsirrhine primates. We begin by reviewing this
   literature, focusing on nocturnal species. Our understanding about the
   information content of scent signals and the factors driving species
   diversity remains incomplete, owing to difficulties in acquiring
   comparative chemical data. We therefore re-examine such a data set,
   representing the richness and relative abundance of volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) in the urine of 12 species (from Galagidae, Lorisidae,
   Daubentoniidae, Cheirogaleidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae), to explore
   differences between nocturnal, diurnal and cathemeral species. As
   predicted by the variable importance of urine marking across species,
   the urine of nocturnal strepsirrhines contained the most VOCs and
   putative semiochemicals, differed significantly in composition from that
   of diurnal and cathemeral species and showed the strongest species scent
   signatures. Relevant to retracing the evolutionary trajectory of
   cathemeral strepsirrhines, nocturnal and diurnal species were most
   differentiated in their VOCs, with cathemeral species being
   intermediary, but more closely aligned with diurnal species. These data
   support cathemerality as an ancient expansion of diurnal animals into a
   nocturnal niche. Consideration of the traits and variables associated
   with olfactory communication offers a profitable new way for examining
   species diversity and patterns of evolutionary change. (c) 2019 S.

Title = {Effects of aging on the biomechanics of Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus
   coquereli): Evidence of robustness to senescence},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {235-240},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {It is well-known that as humans age they experience significant changes
   in gait including reduction in velocity and ground reaction forces and
   changes in leg mechanics. Progressive changes in gait can lead to
   disability and frailty, defined as an inability to carry out activities
   of daily living. This topic is relevant to basic understanding of the
   aging process and for clinical intervention. As such, studies of frailty
   can benefit from nonhuman animal models, yet little is known about gait
   frailty in nonhuman primates. This study examines a nonhuman primate
   model to evaluate its relevance to understanding human aging processes.
   To test the null hypothesis that age-related changes in joint function
   and gait do occur in primate models in a similar fashion to humans, a
   detailed gait analysis, including velocity, footfall timings, and
   vertical ground reaction forces, on bipedal locomotion was performed in
   Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli), ranging in age from 5 years
   to 24 years. None of the spatiotemporal or kinetic gait variables
   measured was significantly correlated with age alone. There was a slight
   but significant reduction in locomotor velocity when animals were
   grouped into ``young{''} and ``old{''} categories. These data show that
   aging P. coquereli experience only subtle age-related changes, that were
   not nearly as extensive as reported in humans. This lack of change
   suggests that unlike humans, lemurs maintain gait competency at high
   levels, possibly because these animals maintain reproductive capacity
   close to their age of death and that frailty may be selected against,
   since gait disability would result in injury and death that would
   preclude independent living. Although nonhuman primates should
   experience age-related senescence, their locomotor performance should
   remain robust throughout their lifetimes, which raises questions about
   the use of primate models of gait disability, an area that deserves
   further investigation.},

Abstract = {Noninvasive sampling is an important development in population genetic
   monitoring of wild animals. Particularly, the collection of
   environmental DNA (eDNA) which can be collected without needing to
   encounter the target animal facilitates the genetic analysis of
   endangered species. One method that has been applied to these sample
   types is target capture and enrichment which overcomes the issue of high
   proportions of exogenous (nonhost) DNA from these lower quality samples.
   We tested whether target capture of mitochondrial DNA from sampled
   feeding traces of the aye-aye, an endangered lemur species would yield
   mitochondrial DNA sequences for population genetic monitoring. We
   sampled gnawed wood where aye-ayes excavate wood-boring insect larvae
   from trees. We designed RNA probes complementary to the aye-aye's
   mitochondrial genome and used these to isolate aye-aye DNA from other
   nontarget DNA in these samples. We successfully retrieved six
   near-complete mitochondrial genomes from two sites within the aye-aye's
   geographic range that had not been sampled previously. Our method
   demonstrates the application of next-generation molecular techniques to
   species of conservation concern. This method can likely be applied to
   alternative foraged remains to sample endangered species other than
   aye-ayes.},

Title = {Ectoparasite communities of small-bodied Malagasy primates: seasonal and
   socioecological influences on tick, mite and lice infestation of
   Microcebus murinus and M. ravelobensis in northwestern Madagascar
   Annette},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Background: Ectoparasitic infections are of particular interest for
   endangered wildlife, as ectoparasites are potential vectors for inter-
   and intraspecific pathogen transmission and may be indicators to assess
   the health status of endangered populations. Here, ectoparasite dynamics
   in sympatric populations of two Malagasy mouse lemur species, Microcebus
   murinus and M. ravelobensis, were investigated over an 11-month period.
   Furthermore, the animals' body mass was determined as an indicator of
   body condition, reflecting seasonal and environmental challenges. Living
   in sympatry, the two study species experience the same environmental
   conditions, but show distinct differences in socioecology: Microcebus
   murinus sleeps in tree holes, either solitarily (males) or sometimes in
   groups (females only), whereas M. ravelobensis sleeps in mixed-sex
   groups in more open vegetation.
   Results: Both mouse lemur species hosted ticks (Haemaphysalis sp.), lice
   (Lemurpediculus sp.) and mites (Trombiculidae gen. sp. and Laelaptidae
   gen. sp.). Host species, as well as temporal variations (month and
   year), were identified as the main factors influencing infestation. Tick
   infestation peaked in the late dry season and was significantly more
   often observed in M. murinus (P = 0.011), while lice infestation was
   more likely in M. ravelobensis (P < 0.001) and showed a continuous
   increase over the course of the dry season. Genetic analyses identified
   Lemurpediculus sp. infesting both mouse lemur species. Ticks
   morphologically conform to H. lemuris, but genetic analysis showed a
   clear differentiation of the specimens collected in this study,
   suggesting a potentially new tick species. Host body mass decreased from
   the early to the late dry season, indicating nutritional stress during
   this period, which may render individuals more susceptible to parasitic
   infections.
   Conclusions: Seasonal differences and species-specific variations in
   sleeping site ecology in terms of sleeping site type and sociality were
   determined as key factors influencing ectoparasitism in M. murinus and
   M. ravelobensis. This needs to be taken into account when evaluating
   ectoparasite infestations at a given time point The detection of the
   same parasite species on two closely related and sympatric host species
   furthermore indicates a potential pathway for disease transmission, not
   only within but also between lemur species.},

Title = {Are sleeping site ecology and season linked to intestinal helminth
   prevalence and diversity in two sympatric, nocturnal and arboreal
   primate hosts (Lepilemur edwardsi and Avahi occidentalis)?},
Journal = {BMC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {JUL 13},
Abstract = {Background: Various factors, such as climate, body size and sociality
   are often linked to parasitism. This constrains the identification of
   other determinants driving parasite infections. Here, we investigate for
   the first time intestinal parasites in two sympatric arboreal primate
   species, which share similar activity patterns, feeding ecology, body
   size and sociality, and cope with the same climate conditions, but
   differ in sleeping site ecology: the Milne-Edward's sportive lemur
   (Lepilemur edwardsi) and the Western woolly lemur (Avahi occidentalis).
   Comparison of these two species aimed to test whether differences in
   sleeping sites are related to differences in parasite infection
   patterns. Additionally, gender and seasonal factors were taken into
   account. Animals were radio-collared to record their sleeping site
   dynamics and to collect fecal samples to assess intestinal parasitism
   during both the dry and the rainy season.
   Results: Only low parasite diversity was detected, which is attributable
   to the strict arboreal lifestyle of these lemurs, limiting their contact
   with infective parasite stages. L. edwardsi, which sleeps in tree holes
   and repeatedly uses the same sleeping site, excreted eggs of strongyle
   and oxyurid nematodes, whereby strongyles always occurred in coinfection
   with oxyurids. In contrast, A. occidentalis, which sleeps on open
   branches and frequently changes sleeping sites, only excreted eggs of
   strongyle nematodes. This difference can be attributed to a potential
   favorable environment presented by tree holes for infective stages,
   facilitating parasitic transmission. Additionally, Strongylida in A.
   occidentalis were only observed in the rainy season, suggesting an
   arrested development during the dry season in the nematodes' life cycle.
   Males and females of both lemur species showed the same frequency of
   parasitism. No differences in body mass of infected and non-infected
   individuals were observed, indicating that the animals' body condition
   remains unaffected by the detected gastrointestinal parasites.
   Conclusions: The comparison of two primate hosts with a very similar
   lifestyle suggests an influence of the sleeping site ecology on
   intestinal parasites. In A. occidentalis there was a clear seasonal
   difference in strongyle egg excretion. These results improve our
   understanding of the parasite ecology in these endangered primate
   species, which may be critical in the light of species conservation.},

Title = {Crowding as a primary source of stress in an endangered

Abstract = {Nutritional and social challenges arising from habitat fragmentation can
   be significant sources of stress for animals. If prolonged, such
   stressors can pose a threat to the longevity of a species within a
   fragmented landscape. While each may elicit a physiological response,
   the coupled and often additive nature of these stressors can make it
   difficult to determine their relative impact on an individual or
   population. We measured fecal glucocorticoids (fGC) in two populations
   of Lemur catta, an endangered strepsirrhine primate, inhabiting forest
   fragments that vary markedly in resource structure and population
   density. We also examined the relative importance of behavioral
   variables indicative of feeding environment, intergroup territoriality,
   and intragroup social interactions in predicting fGC levels in these
   populations. Lemurcatta living with ample food resources but at high
   population density exhibited higher fGC concentrations throughout the
   study period, independent of sex or reproductive state. At both sites,
   fGC levels reflected consistent seasonal variation, with lowest levels
   occurring during the resource-rich pre-mating period. Foraging effort
   was positively associated with fGC levels at each site, yet the
   population exhibiting the highest foraging effort had consistently lower
   levels of fGC. Intergroup territoriality was a positive predictor and
   intragroup agonism a negative predictor of fGC levels; however, trends
   in these variables were inconsistent when examining the two sites
   separately. Within-site group differences highlighted the additive
   nature of nutritional and social stressors in predicting fGC levels. Our
   results suggest that the intense or unpredictable impact of crowding
   and, correspondingly, heightened intergroup resource defense may be an
   important consideration when addressing long-term conservation
   initiatives for fragment-dwelling L.catta.},

Title = {Strontium Isotopes are Consistent With Low-Elevation Foraging Limits for
   Henst's Goshawk},
Journal = {WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Apex predators play critical roles in the ecosystems they inhabit.
   Unfortunately, little is known about movement patterns for many species.
   This information is critical for evaluating vulnerability to habitat
   loss and the adequacy of existing or proposed protected areas. Strontium
   isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86) in prey remains reflect the geology where
   individuals lived and were killed, and can be used to identify foraging
   ranges for predators. We tested the degree to which Sr-87/Sr-86 in
   consumed lemurs (Lemuroidea) can be used to track foraging ranges for
   Henst's goshawk (Accipiter henstii) at Ranomafana National Park (RNP),
   eastern Madagascar, Africa. This large-bodied endemic accipiter is
   sparsely distributed and rarely observed outside of forest or at
   elevations >1,200m. A geologic boundary divides lower and higher
   elevations at RNP: Precambrian migmatite is at lower elevations within
   and to the east of RNP and Precambrian metasediments are limited to
   higher elevations in southwestern RNP. We collected foliage from trees
   and understory plants to establish Sr-87/Sr-86 for both geologies, and
   remains from 19 depredated lemurs from 4 hawk nests located along the
   eastern edge of RNP. Leaves from metasediments have greater Sr-87/Sr-86
   than leaves from migmatite. Sr-87/Sr-86 for lemur bones suggests that 18
   of the 19 predated individuals came from forests underlain by migmatite.
   Thus, strontium isotope data suggest that Henst's goshawk primarily
   hunted on migmatite at RNP, which supports a growing body of evidence
   that this species forages at elevations below approximately 1,200m. Most
   reserves in eastern Madagascar protect forest at higher elevations.
   Conserving remaining forest and revegetating denuded land at lower
   elevations will likely be critical for survival of this species.
   Understanding mobility patterns is crucial for managing predator
   populations. Isotopic analysis of prey is a noninvasive method for
   monitoring foraging ranges that complements existing approaches. This
   geochemical tool is readily adaptable to other systems and species. (C)

Abstract = {Primate populations are declining the world over due to anthropogenic
   threats, including habitat loss and degradation. This raises the
   important question of how much habitat degradation a species can cope
   with. Habitat degradation is pronounced in Madagascar, where most of the
   human population depends on the direct exploitation of natural
   resources. We aimed to identify the response of Microcebus griseorufus
   (the gray-brown mouse lemur) to forest degradation and to define the
   structural traits of the vegetation that might be crucial for the
   species' occurrence in anthropogenic landscapes. We documented the
   occurrence of Microcebus griseorufus in relation to vegetation
   structures along a gradient of forest degradation, at the edge of and
   west of Tsimanampetsotsa National Park in April and May 2007 and from
   October to December 2015. We confirmed the occurrence of Microcebus
   griseorufus using trapping and visual surveys, and measured vegetation
   structure. Logistic regression models showed that Microcebus griseorufus
   has a threshold response to tree density and the diameter of thick
   trees. The thresholds of occurrence were at 10-15\% of the tree density
   recorded in intact forest and a mean diameter of trees with a diameter
   at breast height of > 10 cm of 14.3 cm. The definition of such
   thresholds might help to maintain suitable habitat for this species and
   other primates living in anthropogenic landscapes, providing
   connectivity between isolated protected areas and allowing dispersal
   between populations.},

Title = {Sleeping site ecology, but not sex, affect ecto- and hemoparasite risk,
   in sympatric, arboreal primates (Avahi occidentalis and Lepilemur
   edwardsi)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},

Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Background: A central question in evolutionary parasitology is to what
   extent ecology impacts patterns of parasitism in wild host populations.
   In this study, we aim to disentangle factors influencing the risk of
   parasite exposure by exploring the impact of sleeping site ecology on
   infection with ectoparasites and vector-borne hemoparasites in two
   sympatric primates endemic to Madagascar. Both species live in the same
   dry deciduous forest of northwestern Madagascar and cope with the same
   climatic constraints, they are arboreal, nocturnal, cat-sized and
   pair-living but differ prominently in sleeping site ecology. The Western
   woolly lemur (Avahi occidentalis) sleeps on open branches and frequently
   changes sleeping sites, whereas the Milne-Edward's sportive lemur
   (Lepilemur edwardsi) uses tree holes, displaying strong sleeping site
   fidelity. Sleeping in tree holes should confer protection from
   mosquito-borne hemoparasites, but should enhance the risk for
   ectoparasite infestation with mites and nest-adapted ticks. Sex may
   affect parasite risk in both species comparably, with males bearing a
   higher risk than females due to an immunosuppressive effect of higher
   testosterone levels in males or to sex-specific behavior. To explore
   these hypotheses, ectoparasites and blood samples were collected from 22
   individuals of A. occidentalis and 26 individuals of L. edwardsi during
   the dry and rainy season.
   Results: L. edwardsi, but not A. occidentalis, harbored ectoparasites,
   namely ticks (Haemaphysalis lemuris {[}Ixodidae], Ornithodoros sp.
   {[}Argasidae]) and mites (Aetholaelaps trilyssa, {[}Laelapidae]),
   suggesting that sleeping in tree holes promotes infestation with
   ectoparasites. Interestingly, ectoparasites were found solely in the
   hot, rainy season with a prevalence of 75\% (N = 16 animals). Blood
   smears were screened for the presence and infection intensity of
   hemoparasites. Microfilariae were detected in both species.
   Morphological characteristics suggested that each lemur species harbored
   two different filarial species. Prevalence of microfilarial infection
   was significantly lower in L. edwardsi than in A. occidentalis. No
   significant difference in infection intensity between the two host
   species, and no effect of season, daytime of sampling or sex on
   prevalence or infection intensity was found. In neither host species,
   parasite infection showed an influence on body weight as an indicator
   for body condition.
   Conclusions: Our findings support that sleeping site ecology affects
   ectoparasite infestation in nocturnal, arboreal mammalian hosts in the
   tropics, whereas there is no significant effect of host sex. The
   influence of sleeping site ecology to vector-borne hemoparasite risk is
   less pronounced. The observed parasite infections did not affect body
   condition and thus may be of minor importance for shaping reproductive
   fitness. Findings provide first evidence for the specific relevance of
   sleeping site ecology on parasitism in arboreal and social mammals.
   Further, our results increase the sparse knowledge on ecological drivers
   of primate host-parasite interactions and transmission pathways in
   natural tropical environments.},

Title = {Hair cortisol concentrations correlate negatively with survival in a
   wild primate population},
Journal = {BMC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Background: Glucocorticoid hormones are known to play a key role in
   mediating a cascade of physiological responses to social and ecological
   stressors and can therefore influence animals' behaviour and ultimately
   fitness. Yet, how glucocorticoid levels are associated with reproductive
   success or survival in a natural setting has received little empirical
   attention so far. Here, we examined links between survival and levels of
   glucocorticoid in a small, short-lived primate, the grey mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus), using for the first time an indicator of long-term
   stress load (hair cortisol concentration). Using a
   capture-mark-recapture modelling approach, we assessed the effect of
   stress on survival in a broad context (semi-annual rates), but also
   under a specific period of high energetic demands during the
   reproductive season. We further assessed the power of other commonly
   used health indicators (body condition and parasitism) in predicting
   survival outcomes relative to the effect of long-term stress.
   Results: We found that high levels of hair cortisol were associated with
   reduced survival probabilities both at the semi-annual scale and over
   the reproductive season. Additionally, very good body condition
   (measured as scaled mass index) was related to increased survival at the
   semi-annual scale, but not during the breeding season. In contrast,
   variation in parasitism failed to predict survival.
   Conclusion: Altogether, our results indicate that long-term increased
   glucocorticoid levels can be related to survival and hence population
   dynamics, and suggest differential strength of selection acting on
   glucocorticoids, body condition, and parasite infection.},

Abstract = {Background. Opacities of the lens are typical age-related phenomena
   which have a high influence on photoreception and consequently circadian
   rhythm. In mouse lemurs, a small bodied non-human primate, a high
   incidence (more than 50\% when >seven years) of cataracts has been
   previously described during aging. Previous studies showed that
   photoperiodically induced accelerated annual rhythms alter some of mouse
   lemurs' life history traits. Whether a modification of photoperiod also
   affects the onset of age dependent lens opacities has not been
   investigated so far. The aim of this study was therefore to characterise
   the type of opacity and the mouse lemurs' age at its onset in two
   colonies with different photoperiodic regimen.
   Methods. Two of the largest mouse lemur colonies in Europe were
   investigated: Colony 1 having a natural annual photoperiodic regime and
   Colony 2 with an induced accelerated annual cycle. A slit-lamp was used
   to determine opacities in the lens. Furthermore, a subset of all animals
   which showed no opacities in the lens nucleus in the first examination
   but developed first changes in the following examination were further
   examined to estimate the age at onset of opacities. In total, 387
   animals were examined and 57 represented the subset for age at onset
   estimation.
   Results. The first and most commonly observable opacity in the lens was
   nuclear sclerosis. Mouse lemurs from Colony 1 showed a delayed onset of
   nuclear sclerosis compared to mouse lemurs from Colony 2 (4.35 +/- 1.50
   years vs. 2.75 +/- 0.99 years). For colony 1, the chronological age was
   equivalent to the number of seasonal cycles experienced by the mouse
   lemurs. For colony 2, in which seasonal cycles were accelerated by a
   factor of 1.5, mouse lemurs had experienced 4.13 +/- 1.50 seasonal
   cycles in 2.75 +/- 0.99 chronological years.
   Discussion. Our study showed clear differences in age at the onset of
   nuclear sclerosis formation between lemurs kept under different
   photoperiodic regimes. Instead of measuring the chronological age, the
   number of seasonal cycles (N = four) experienced by a mouse lemur can be
   used to estimate the risk of beginning nuclear sclerosis formation.
   Ophthalmological examinations should be taken into account when animals
   older than 5-6 seasonal cycles are used for experiments in which
   unrestricted visual ability has to be ensured. This study is the first
   to assess and demonstrate the influence of annual photoperiod regime on
   the incidence of lens opacities in a non-human primate.},

Title = {Predator avoidance and dietary fibre predict diurnality in the
   cathemeral folivore Hapalemur meridionalis},

Abstract = {Though numerous mammalian taxa exhibit cathemerality (i.e. activity
   distributed across the 24-h cycle), this includes very few primates,
   exceptions being species from Aotinae and Lemuridae. Four non-mutually
   exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the ultimate
   determinants for cathemeral activity in lemurs: thermoregulatory
   benefits, anti-predator strategy, competition avoidance and metabolic
   dietary-related needs. However, these have only been explored in the
   frugivorous genus Eulemur, with some species increasing nocturnality as
   a possible response to avoid diurnal raptors and to increase their
   ability to digest fibre during resource-scarce periods. Since Eulemur
   lack specializations for digesting bulk food, this strategy would allow
   for processing fibres over the full 24-h. The folivorous lemurids, i.e.
   genus Hapalemur, provide a divergent model to explore these hypotheses
   due to gastrointestinal adaptations for digesting dietary fibre and
   small body size compared to Eulemur. We linked continuous activity data
   collected from archival tags with observational behaviour and feeding
   data from three groups of adult Hapalemur meridionalis from January to
   December 2013. We tested the effects of thermoregulation, predator
   avoidance and the weighted proportion of digestible dietary fibre on the
   daily diurnal/nocturnal activity ratio using a Linear Mixed-Model. Our
   best-fit model revealed that increased canopy exposure and dietary fibre
   predicted greater diurnality. Our findings partly contrast with previous
   predictions for frugivorous lemurids. We propose a divergent adaptive
   explanation for folivorous lemurids. We suggest that the need to avoid
   terrestrial predators, as well as longer digestive bouts during bulk
   food periods, may override cathemerality in favour of diurnality in
   these bamboo lemurs.
   Significance statement
   Southern bamboo lemurs are active throughout the 24-h day, with high
   proportions of dietary fibre increasing diurnality, in contrast to other
   cathemeral primates. They also increase diurnality on days when using
   areas with greater canopy exposure, potentially avoiding nocturnal
   predators in risky foraging areas. We suggest that folivorous lemurids
   may require long periods of inactivity to conserve energy and digest
   dietary fibre, thus limiting activity to periods of optimal foraging
   efficiency over the 24-h cycle.},

Abstract = {Palaeopropithecids, or ``sloth lemurs,{''} are a diverse clade of
   large-bodied Malagasy subfossil primates characterized by their inferred
   suspensory positional behavior. The most recently discovered genus of
   the palaeopropithecids is Babakotia, and it has been described as more
   arboreal than Mesopropithecus, but less than Palaeopropithecus. In this
   article, the within-bone and between-bones articular and cross-sectional
   diaphyseal proportions of the humerus and femur of Babakotia were
   compared to extant lemurs, Mesopropithecus and Palaeopropithecus in
   order to further understand its arboreal adaptations. Additionally, a
   sample of apes and sloths (Choloepus and Bradypus) are included as
   functional outgroups composed of suspensory adapted primates and
   non-primates. Results show that Babakotia and Mesopropithecus both have
   high humeral/femoral shaft strength proportions, similar to extant great
   apes and sloths and indicative of forelimb suspensory behavior, with
   Babakotia more extreme in this regard. All three subfossil taxa have
   relatively large femoral heads, also associated with suspension in
   modern taxa. However, Babakotia and Mesopropithecus (but not
   Palaeopropithecus) have relatively small femoral head surface area to
   shaft strength proportions suggesting that hind-limb positioning in
   these taxa during climbing and other behaviors was different than in
   extant great apes, involving less mobility. Knee and humeral articular
   dimensions relative to shaft strengths are small in Babakotia and
   Mesopropithecus, similar to those found in modern sloths and divergent
   from those in extant great apes and lemurs, suggesting more sloth-like
   use of these joints during locomotion. Mesopropithecus and Babakotia are
   more similar to Choloepus in humerofemoral head and length proportions
   while Palaeopropithecus is more similar to Bradypus. These results
   provide further evidence of the suspensory adaptations of Babakotia and
   further highlight similarities to both extant suspensory primates and
   non-primate slow arboreal climbers and hangers. (C) 2016 Wiley

   Ampasambazimba in the Central Highlands, part of the subhumid
   bioclimatic zone. The eagle remains from Ankilitelo Cave considerably
   expands the known geographical and ecological range of this species,
   which would have been a formidable predator and presumably feeding

Abstract = {The fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis is the causative agent of
   alveolar echinococcosis, a severe zoonotic disease that may be fatal if
   untreated. A broad spectrum of mammalian species may be accidentally
   infected even in captivity. In April 2011, liver lesions due to E.
   multilocularis were observed during the necropsy of a captive born
   nutria (Myocastor coypus) in a French wildlife park, leading to
   initiation of a study to survey the parasite's presence in the park. A
   comparable environmental contamination with fox's feces infected by E.
   multilocularis was reported inside (17.8\%) and outside (20.6\%) the
   park. E. multilocularis worms were found in the intestines of three of
   the five roaming foxes shot in the park. Coprological analyses of
   potential definitive hosts in captivity (fox, lynx, wildcat, genet,
   wolf, bear and raccoon) revealed infection in one Eurasian wolf. Voles
   trapped inside the park also had a high prevalence of 5.3\%. After
   diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis in a Lemur catta during necropsy,
   four other cases in L. cotta were detected by a combination of
   ultrasound and serology. These animals were treated twice daily with
   albendazole. The systematic massive metacestode development and numerous
   protoscoleces in L. catta confirmed their particular sensitivity to E.
   multilocularis infection. The autochthonous origin of the infection in
   all the captive animals infected was genetically confirmed by EmsB
   microsatellite analysis. Preventive measures were implemented to avoid
   the presence of roaming foxes, contact with potential definitive hosts
   and contaminated food sources for potential intermediate hosts. (C) 2016

Title = {Next-generation genotyping of hypervariable loci in many individuals of
   a non-model species: technical and theoretical implications},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {Background: Across species, diversity at the Major Histocompatibility
   Complex (MHC) is critical to disease resistance and population health;
   however, use of MHC diversity to quantify the genetic health of
   populations has been hampered by the extreme variation found in MHC
   genes. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology generates sufficient
   data to genotype even the most diverse species, but workflows for
   distinguishing artifacts from alleles are still under development. We
   used NGS to evaluate the MHC diversity of over 300 captive and wild
   ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta: Primates: Mammalia). We modified a
   published workflow to address errors that arise from deep sequencing
   individuals and tested for evidence of selection at the most diverse MHC
   genes.
   Results: In addition to evaluating the accuracy of 454 Titanium and Ion
   Torrent PGM for genotyping large populations at hypervariable genes, we
   suggested modifications to improve current methods of allele calling.
   Using these modifications, we genotyped 302 out of 319 individuals,
   obtaining an average sequencing depth of over 1000 reads per amplicon.
   We identified 55 MHC-DRB alleles, 51 of which were previously
   undescribed, and provide the first sequences of five additional MHC
   genes: DOA, DOB, DPA, DQA, and DRA. The additional five MHC genes had
   one or two alleles each with little sequence variation; however, the 55
   MHC-DRB alleles showed a high dN/dS ratio and trans-species
   polymorphism, indicating a history of positive selection. Because each
   individual possessed 1-7 MHC-DRB alleles, we suggest that ring-tailed
   lemurs have four, putatively functional, MHC-DRB copies.
   Conclusions: In the future, accurate genotyping methods for NGS data
   will be critical to assessing genetic variation in non-model species. We
   recommend that future NGS studies increase the proportion of replicated
   samples, both within and across platforms, particularly for
   hypervariable genes like the MHC. Quantifying MHC diversity within
   non-model species is the first step to assessing the relationship of
   genetic diversity at functional loci to individual fitness and
   population viability. Owing to MHC-DRB diversity and copy number,
   ring-tailed lemurs may serve as an ideal model for estimating the
   interaction between genetic diversity, fitness, and environment,
   especially regarding endangered species.},

Title = {Why ``monogamy{''} isn't good enough},

Volume = {78},

Abstract = {Rare in mammals but more common in primates, there remains a
   considerable controversy concerning whether primate species
   traditionally described as monogamous actually express this highly
   specialized breeding pattern. Unfortunately the definition of monogamy
   varies greatly, inhibiting our understanding of this trait and two
   related traits with which monogamy is often conflated: pair-living and
   pair-bonding. Strepsirrhine primates are useful models to study factors
   that select for pair-living, pair-bonding, and monogamy because this
   taxon exhibits high incidences of each trait, in addition to species
   that exhibit behaviors that reflect combinations of these traits.
   Several hypotheses have been articulated to help explain the evolution
   of monogamy, but again, these hypotheses often conflate pair-living,
   pair-bonding, and/or monogamy. In this review, we (1) propose clear,
   discrete, and logical definitions for each trait; (2) review variation
   in strepsirrhines with respect to these three traits; (3) clarify which
   of these traits can be explained by existing hypotheses; and (4) provide
   an example of the applicability of the Resource Defense Hypothesis (RDH)
   to understand two of these traits, pair-living and pair-bonding, in the
   red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer). Available data support the RDH
   for pair-living in red-bellied lemurs. They live in stable family groups
   with one adult pair. Both sexes actively codefend territories that
   overlap little with other pairs' territories. Agonism is extremely rare
   within groups and intergroup and interspecific agonism varies with food
   availability. Available data also support the RDH for pair-bonding.
   Pair-bonds are cohesive year-round. Pairs coordinate behaviors to defend
   territories with auditory and olfactory signals. Cohesion increases with
   food abundance and both sexes reinforce bonds. We indicate where
   additional data will help to more rigorously test the RDH for each trait
   and encourage others to test alternative hypotheses. Am. J. Primatol.

Abstract = {Although infrequent among primates, twinning is common among
   strepsirrhines, a group of primates that includes the lemurs of
   Madagascar. As with any multifetal pregnancy, complications during
   gestation or even parturition can arise due to various factors (e.g.,
   amniotic infection, stress). On rare occasions during labour of twins,
   parturition may be delayed between the two neonates, a phenomenon known
   as `delayed interval delivery' that has been well-documented among the
   human medical journals. Based on circumstantial evidence, we report an
   opportunistic account of a habituated, adult female southern bamboo
   lemur (Hapalemur meridionalis) from Mandena, southeast Madagascar, first
   giving birth to an infant in mid-October 2013 (found deceased), and then
   birthing a live infant sometime between 5-21 days later. Similar to
   cases reported in human medical literature, the second infant survived
   and appeared to stay healthy until the conclusion of the study. Our
   account of asynchronous parturition of twins in a non-human primate is,
   to our knowledge, the first reported case in the literature.},

Abstract = {Genetic data can be combined with ecological data to study the
   demographic history of a species, identify landscape features that
   influence migration patterns, and guide conservation efforts. Perrier's
   sifaka (Propithecus perrieri) is a Critically Endangered, rare, and
   elusive social lemur living in a very restricted, fragmented landscape.
   To assess the effect of habitat loss and fragmentation on the genetic
   diversity of the Perrier's sifaka population we examined 24
   microsatellite markers genotyped for 67 samples corresponding to 42
   individuals. Perrier's sifaka shows a low current effective population
   size (ca. 52-105) and a strong heterozygosity excess, suggesting a
   historically large but dwindling population. Moreover, we identified a
   pattern of isolation by distance, typical of continuous habitat,
   suggesting that sifakas were still able to cross the grasslands between
   forest fragments in the recent past. Our study calls for a unified
   conservation plan covering the two protected areas where the species is
   still present, if not the whole area of its past distribution. Further
   studies inferring the past demographic history of Perrier's sifaka may
   confirm the population decline and shed light on its potential causes.},

Abstract = {The diversity of qualitative approaches and analytical methods has often
   undermined comparative research on primate vocal repertoires. The
   purpose of the present work is to introduce a quantitative method based
   on dynamic time warping to the study of repertoire size in Eulemur spp.
   We obtained a large sample of calls of E. coronatus, E. flavifrons, E.
   fulvus, E. macaco, E. mongoz, E. rubriventer, and E. rufus, recorded
   between 1999 and 2013 from captive and wild lemurs. We inspected
   recordings visually using spectrograms, then cut and saved high-quality
   vocal emissions to single files for further analysis. We extracted the
   acoustic features of all vocalizations of a species using the Hidden
   Markov Model Toolkit, an application of dynamic time warping, and then
   compared cepstral coefficients (a feature widely used in automatic
   speaker recognition) pairwise. We analyzed the results using affinity
   propagation clustering. We found that Eulemur species share most of
   their vocal repertoire but species-specific calls determine repertoire
   size differences. Repertoire size varied from 9 to 14 vocalization types
   among species, with a mean of 11.},

Title = {Cathemerality in a small, folivorous primate: proximate control of diel

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {A non-adherence to a strict diurnal or nocturnal activity cycle is
   prevalent among mammals, including taxa of Lemuridae, but rare among
   other primates. While non-mutually exclusive ecological hypotheses
   attempted to explain the evolution of this activity, termed
   cathemerality, as either an old or a recent phenomenon, the scarcity of
   systematic data collected over 24 h limits our potential to explore its
   proximate and ultimate determinants. Among strepsirrhines, systematic
   studies involving only two lemurid genera (Eulemur and Lemur) have
   recorded this activity pattern, while fewer quantitative observations
   are available for other taxa. If cathemerality could be shown in most
   members of Lemuridae despite their different ecological adaptations,
   this would support the hypothesis that this trait is basal and appeared
   early during lemurid evolution. Here, we investigated whether the
   folivorous southern bamboo lemur (Hapalemur meridionalis) exhibits
   cathemeral activity, and determined which environmental factors
   influence its pattern. We deployed ten archival tags across four social
   groups to continuously record activity data over a 15-month period. This
   allowed us to generate a diurnal/nocturnal (DN) ratio for each 24-h
   period and assess their diel activity. Our data suggest that southern
   bamboo lemurs are cathemeral within Mandena; while climatic factors
   showed no influence, nocturnal activity increased with greater nocturnal
   luminance. Despite contrasting dietary niches, visual morphologies, and
   body sizes between Hapalemur, Eulemur, and Lemur, all three exhibit
   cathemerality and lunarphilia. The close phylogenetic proximity of these
   lemurids supports this flexible activity pattern as an ancestral trait
   that likely dates to the origin of the Lemuridae radiation.},

Title = {Evolving through day and night: origin and diversification of activity

Abstract = {Activity patterns have profound implications on primates' morphology,
   physiology, and behavior and have likely driven their diversification.
   The last common ancestor of extant primates has been traditionally
   considered nocturnal although this notion has been recently debated due
   to emerging contradictory evidence. Previous studies underestimated the
   role of cathemerality (i.e., the ability to remain active throughout a
   24-h cycle) by simplifying primate activity to the diurnal-nocturnal
   dichotomy. We estimated the evolutionary trajectories of activity
   patterns in primates and investigated how these may have influenced
   their diversification rates. We used a comprehensive data set to test
   multiple evolutionary hypotheses, following a robust Bayesian framework
   by using 5000 calibrated phylogenetic trees to account for phylogenetic
   uncertainty. Our results support a nocturnal ancestor that has shifted
   to diurnality in the Simiformes, has retained nocturnality in
   Lorisiformes and most Lemuriformes, and shifted to cathemerality in the
   ancestor of Lemuridae. The diversification of activity patterns in
   primates seems to have mainly arose by speciation rather than shifts
   between activity patterns, suggesting a low flexibility of diurnal and
   nocturnal patterns and the key importance of cathemeral activity as
   transitional state to shift between more specialized activity patterns.
   A cathemeral activity seems to appear well before diurnality in Malagasy
   lemurs, suggesting an ancient origin of this trait on the island and
   rejecting the hypothesis of a recent transition. The present research
   contributes to further disentangle the adaptive role of activity
   patterns in primate evolution.},

Title = {No energetic benefits from sociality in tropical hibernation},
Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {498-505},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Mammals generally profit from social thermoregulation, and the primary
   benefit of sociality during hibernation is thought to be the reduction
   of metabolic demands during periodic arousals. It has even been
   postulated that the energetic advantages during hibernation might have
   been the driver for the evolution of sociality in some mammal species.
   As the necessity to show arousals and the concurring energetic costs
   depend on the temperature regime in the hibernacula, we tested whether
   this is also a plausible scenario in tropical hibernators such as the
   Malagasy lemur Cheirogaleus medius, with comparatively high and often
   fluctuating temperature regimes in their hibernacula. To this end, we
   studied group composition and energy budgets (skin temperature patterns,
   metabolic rate) over three hibernation and activity seasons in a total
   of 53 free-ranging C.medius. Our results show that C.medius mostly
   occupied tree hollows solitarily during hibernation, contrary to the
   active season, and that the energetic savings were comparable for
   individuals hibernating socially in groups or solitarily (both about
   74\% compared to the resting metabolic rate of the active season).
   However, in larger groups, hibernation patterns were less regular and
   synchronized and individual torpor-arousal cycles were more frequently
   interrupted by euthermic group members than in individuals hibernating
   solitarily or in pairs. We conclude that sociality during hibernation is
   not necessarily driven by energetic demands and might even be
   energetically disadvantageous in tropical species (at least in larger
   groups). Other factors, like social coherence or ecological and
   behavioural constraints, may be of greater influence for the evolution
   of sociality under tropical conditions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY},

Volume = {96},
Number = {2},
Pages = {438-445},

Abstract = {Mammals use variations in the length of day to anticipate environmental
   changes and time their reproduction. Light pollution, which affects day
   length perception, could lead to changes in biological functions. To
   explore the effects of light pollution on seasonal reproduction, we
   conducted an experimental study on a strict long-day breeder, the
   nocturnal gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). Twelve females were
   randomly exposed to either a moonlight treatment or a light pollution
   treatment for 5 weeks during the transition from a short-to long-day
   photoperiod. Daily rhythms of locomotor activity and core temperature
   were recorded, and the occurrence of estrus and urinary
   17-beta-estradiol concentrations were monitored. In females exposed to
   light pollution, the first seasonal estrus occurred while they were
   still in a short-day photoperiod, 2 weeks earlier than in females
   exposed to moonlight. Moreover, the daily rhythms profiles of females
   exposed to light pollution showed significant changes that mimicked
   long-day acclimatization. This study demonstrates that light pollution
   can affect daily rhythms and the timing of seasonal estrus in a primate
   and suggests that functional changes in the circadian system may
   underlie the adverse effects of light pollution that are observed in
   wildlife.},

Abstract = {AimSmall body size in Madagascar's dwarf and mouse lemurs
   (Cheirogaleidae) is generally viewed as primitive. We investigated the
   evolution of body size in this family and in its sister-taxon, the
   Lepilemuridae, from phylogenetic, ontogenetic and adaptive perspectives.
   LocationMadagascar.
   MethodsWe used a phylogenetic method to reconstruct the evolution of
   body size in lemurs, and allometric regression models of gestation
   periods and static and growth allometries in Cheirogaleidae and
   Lepilemuridae to test the hypothesis that dwarfing occurred as a result
   of truncated ontogeny (progenesis). We also examined adaptive hypotheses
   relating body size to environmental variability, life history,
   seasonality of reproduction, hypothermy (use of torpor), and a diet rich
   in plant exudates.
   ResultsOur results indicated that cheirogaleids experienced at least
   four independent events of body size reduction from an ancestor as large
   as living Lepilemuridae, by means of progenesis. Our interpretation is
   supported by the paedomorphic appearance and parallel ontogenetic
   trajectories of the dwarf taxa, as well as their very short gestation
   periods and increased fecundity. Lepilemur species that occupy more
   predictable environments are significantly larger than those occupying
   unpredictable habitats.
   Main conclusionsCheirogaleidae appear to be paedomorphic dwarfs, a
   consequence of progenesis, probably as an adaptation to high
   environmental unpredictability. Although the capacity to use hypothermy
   is related to small body size, this advantage is unlikely to have driven
   dwarfing in cheirogaleids. We propose that gummmivory/exudativory
   co-evolved with body size reduction in this clade, probably from a
   folivorous ancestor. Their small size is derived, and their suitability
   as models for the ancestral primate' is therefore dubious.},

Abstract = {The reddish-gray mouse lemur (Microcebus griseorufus) is one of only a
   few small mammals inhabiting the spiny forest of southwestern
   Madagascar. In this study we investigated the physiological adjustments
   which allow these small primates to persist under the challenging
   climatic conditions of their habitat. To this end we measured energy
   expenditure (metabolic rate) and body temperature of 24 naturally
   acclimatized mouse lemurs, kept in outdoor enclosures, during different
   seasons (summer, winter, and the transition period between the two
   seasons). Mouse lemurs displayed two main physiological strategies to
   compensate seasonal and diurnal fluctuations of ambient temperature. On
   the one hand, individuals entered hypometabolism with decreasing ambient
   temperature (T (a)) during the transition period and winter, enabling
   them to save up to 21 \% energy per day (92 \% per hour) compared with
   the normal resting metabolic rate at comparable T (a). On the other
   hand, euthermic mouse lemurs also showed physiological adjustments to
   seasonality when resting: the lower critical temperature of the
   thermoneutral zone decreased from summer to winter by 7.5 A degrees C,
   which allowed mouse lemurs to keep energy demands constant despite
   colder T (a)s during winter. In addition, the basal metabolic rate was
   substantially lowered prior to the winter period, which facilitated
   accumulation of fat reserves. The combination of physiological
   modifications during euthermia in addition to hypometabolism, which can
   be individually adjusted according to external parameters and respective
   body condition, is important as it allows M. griseorufus to cope with
   the environmental variability of an energetically challenging habitat.},

Abstract = {Lemurs are among the world's most threatened mammals. The critically
   endangered black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata), in
   particular, has recently experienced rapid population declines due to
   habitat loss, ecological sensitivities to habitat degradation, and
   extensive human hunting pressure. Despite this, a recent study indicates
   that ruffed lemurs retain among the highest levels of genetic diversity
   for primates. Identifying how this diversity is apportioned and whether
   gene flow is maintained among remnant populations will help to diagnose
   and target conservation priorities. We sampled 209 individuals from 19
   sites throughout the remaining V. variegata range. We used 10
   polymorphic microsatellite loci and similar to 550 bp of mtDNA sequence
   data to evaluate genetic structure and population dynamics, including
   dispersal patterns and recent population declines. Bayesian cluster
   analyses identified two distinct genetic clusters, which optimally
   partitioned data into populations occurring on either side of the
   Mangoro River. Localities north of the Mangoro were characterized by
   greater genetic diversity, greater gene flow (lower genetic
   differentiation) and higher mtDNA haplotype and nucleotide diversity
   than those in the south. Despite this, genetic differentiation across
   all sites was high, as indicated by high average F-ST (0.247) and
   Phi(ST) (0.544), and followed a pattern of isolation-by-distance. We use
   these results to suggest future conservation strategies that include an
   effort to maintain genetic diversity in the north and restore
   connectivity in the south. We also note the discordance between patterns
   of genetic differentiation and current subspecies taxonomy, and
   encourage a re-evaluation of conservation management units moving
   forward.},

Abstract = {Evaluation of the health, prevalence, and incidence of diseases in wild
   populations is a critical component of wildlife management. In addition,
   the establishment of reference physiologic parameters can contribute to
   the assessment of population risks. Complete medical evaluations were
   performed on 33 wild Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) from
   Kirindy Mitea National Park, Madagascar, during two field captures in
   June 2010 and June 2011. Each animal received a complete physical
   examination: weight, body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate
   were recorded, and ectoparasites collected. Blood samples were collected
   for complete blood cell count, differential white blood cell count,
   hemoparasite examination, serum biochemical profile, fat-soluble vitamin
   analysis, trace mineral analysis, and toxoplasmosis and viral serology.
   Fecal samples were collected for bacterial culture and endoparasite
   examination. Significant differences exist between age classes for
   neutrophil and lymphocyte count, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine
   values. Parasites detected were Callistoura sp., Bertiella lemuriformis,
   and Dipetalonema petteri. This publication reports the first complete
   biomedical evaluation of the P. verreauxi and provides a basis for
   hematologic and biochemical comparisons of P. verreauxi in the wild.},

Volume = {35},

Abstract = {The distribution of most recently discovered or described lemur species
   remains poorly known, but many appear to have small geographical ranges,
   making them vulnerable to extinction. Research can contribute to future
   conservation actions on behalf of these species by providing accurate
   information on local distribution and abundance. The distribution of the
   world's smallest primate, the endangered Madame Berthe's mouse lemur
   (Microcebus berthae), is limited to the Menabe Central region of western
   Madagascar. This species was discovered in the 1990s, but many
   fundamental aspects of its ecology remain unknown. The aims of our study
   were therefore to determine the actual distribution of Microcebus
   berthae across the forests of this region, to estimate population
   density, and to examine the species' response to anthropogenic
   activities. We established 35 1-km line transects across Menabe Central,
   on which we surveyed mouse lemurs by distance sampling and live
   trapping. Microcebus berthae does not occur in all remaining forests of
   this small region and its population density is highly heterogeneous,
   both across its geographic range and locally. Within its area of
   occupancy, the population of Microcebus berthae not only was distributed
   according to spatial heterogeneities of the habitat, but also responded
   to anthropogenic disturbances and varied seasonally. Our results
   indicate that Microcebus berthae is susceptible to habitat degradation
   and avoids human environments spatially. As none of the forest remnants
   in which the species still occurs were officially protected until
   recently, immediate conservation actions should focus on effectively
   protecting Kirindy and Ambadira forests.},

Abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms maintaining local species richness is a
   major topic in tropical ecology. In ecological communities of
   Madagascar, primates represent a major part of mammalian diversity and,
   thus, are a suitable taxon to study these mechanisms. Previous research
   suggested that ecological niche differentiation facilitates the
   coexistence of lemurs. However, detailed data on all species making up
   diverse local primate assemblages is rarely available, hampering
   community-wide tests of niche differentiation among Malagasy mammals.
   Here, we took an indirect approach and used stable isotopes as long-term
   indicators of individuals' diets to answer the question of whether
   trophic patterns and food-related mechanisms stabilize coexistence in a
   species-rich lemur community. We analyzed stable carbon and nitrogen
   isotopes in hair collected from eight syntopic lemurs in Kirindy Forest.
   We found that lemur species were well separated into trophic niches and
   ranged over two trophic levels. Furthermore, species were densely packed
   in isotopic space suggesting that past competitive interactions between
   species are a major structuring force of this dry forest lemur
   community. Results of other comparative studies on primates and our
   findings underline thatin contrast to communities worldwidethe structure
   and composition of lemur communities follow predictions of ecological
   niche theory. Patterns of competitive interactions might be more clearly
   revealed in Malagasy primate communities than elsewhere because lemurs
   represent a large fraction of ecologically interacting species in these
   communities. The pronounced trophic niche differentiation among lemurs
   is most likely due to intense competition in the past as is
   characteristic for adaptive radiations. Am J Phys Anthropol 153:249-259,

Abstract = {The answer to the proffered question, ``What is a species?{''} is
   considered one of the fundamental issues of biological science, as well
   as one of the most polarizing and sometimes acrimonious problems. Dozens
   of species concepts have been defined, but none are universal for
   implementation across all taxa. Within the past thirty years, the
   ability to analyze DNA data has progressed to the point that multiple
   methodologies can be simultaneously applied to the same evolutionary
   questions. The use of restriction fragment length polymorphisms,
   microsatellites, and mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nucDNA)
   sequence data has unarguably changed how we look at diversity and
   intensified the concept debate through the proliferation of species
   descriptions. Over the past two decades, Madagascar's biodiversity has
   gone through a tremendous taxonomic expansion by the elevation of
   subspecies to species and through novel descriptions, especially within
   the nocturnal lemurs. With the tremendous continuous loss of habitat,
   exponential human population growth, and stochastic changes predicted
   over coming decades, elucidating the earth's biodiversity will never be
   more important than now. Here, we examine species concepts and their
   attendant criteria. We predict how technological advances will alter,
   improve and, we hope, fully consolidate the unity of thoughts related to
   this central topic of evolutionary biology and its numerous
   interconnected disciplines.},

Abstract = {Communal nesting, where several mothers regularly pool and cooperatively
   rear offspring, is unusual in mammals. This type of crSching behavior is
   especially rare among primates, with the notable exceptions of humans,
   some nocturnal strepsirrhines, and-as we show in this
   study-black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata). Here, we
   combine data on nesting behavior, genetic relatedness, and infant
   survivorship to describe variation in ruffed lemur infant care and to
   examine the potential benefits of ruffed lemur communal breeding.
   Reproductive events were rare, and females produced litters
   (synchronously) only once in 6 years of observation. We show that not
   all mothers participate in communal crSches, but those that did had
   greater maternal success; communal breeders spent more time feeding and
   their offspring were more likely to survive. Although cooperating
   mothers were often related, females also cooperated with non-kin, and
   those who shared infant care responsibilities had greater maternal
   success than mothers who did not participate. If there is indeed a
   causal link between maternal cooperation and reproductive success, this
   unusual behavior, like that of human communal rearing, may have evolved
   via some combination of kin selection and mutualism.},

Abstract = {Anti-amyloid beta (A beta) immunotherapy provides potential benefits in
   Alzheimer's disease patients. Nevertheless, strategies based on A
   beta(1-42) peptide induced encephalomyelitis and possible
   micro-hemorrhages. These outcomes were not expected from studies
   performed in rodents. It is critical to determine if other animal models
   better predict side effects of immunotherapies. Mouse lemur primates can
   develop amyloidosis with aging. Here we used old lemurs to study
   immunotherapy based on A beta(1-42) or A beta-derivative (K6A
   beta(1-30)). We followed anti-A beta(40) immunoglobulin G and M
   responses and A beta levels in plasma. In vivo magnetic resonance
   imaging and histology were used to evaluate amyloidosis,
   neuro-inflammation, vasogenic edema, microhemorrhages, and brain iron
   deposits. The animals responded mainly to the A beta(1-42) immunogen.
   This treatment induced immune response and increased A beta levels in
   plasma and also microhemorrhages and iron deposits in the choroid
   plexus. A complementary study of untreated lemurs showed iron
   accumulation in the choroid plexus with normal aging. Worsening of iron
   accumulation is thus a potential side effect of A beta-immunization at
   prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease, and should be monitored in
   clinical trials. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {Oxidative stress is a key factor in the aging process and in the
   development of age-related diseases. Because nutritional interventions
   such as caloric restriction (CR) delay the onset of age-related diseases
   and increase the lifespan of many species, the impact of a moderate CR
   was tested on male grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), which have a
   median survival time of 5.7 years in captivity. The effects of CR on
   these lemurs were compared with a potential mimetic, resveratrol (RSV),
   a polyphenol naturally found in grapes. We hypothesized that both CR and
   RSV impact oxidative DNA and RNA damage compared to standard-fed control
   (CTL) animals. Adult (3-4 years old) male mouse lemurs were assigned to
   three dietary groups: a CTL group, a CR group receiving 30\% fewer
   calories than the CTL and a RSV group receiving the CTL diet
   supplemented with RSV (200 mg.day(-1).kg(-1)). Oxidative stress was
   estimated after 3, 9, 15 and 21 months of treatment using the
   measurement of oxidized nucleosides in urine samples by mass
   spectrometry. The resting metabolic rate, adjusted for changes in body
   composition, was also measured to assess the potential relationship
   between oxygen consumption and oxidative damage markers. This study
   provides evidence for oxidative stress accumulation with age in grey
   mouse lemur. Dietary interventions resulted in a short-term increase in
   oxidative stress levels followed by reduced levels with increasing age.
   Moreover, in this photoperiod-dependent heterotherm primate, seasonal
   variations in oxidative stress were observed, which was likely due to a
   season-dependent, cost-benefit trade-off between torpor use and
   oxidative stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Habitat Use and Activity Patterns as an Indication of Fragment Quality

Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {388-406},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Considerable intraspecific variation exists in responses to habitat
   fragmentation owing to regional differences in fragment quality. Habitat
   use and activity patterns of resident populations are related to the
   abundance and predictability of resources in time and space, and thus
   space use is one of the most important considerations for evaluating
   habitat quality. Here I examine inter- and intrasite differences in the
   ranging behavior; use of the matrix, i.e., surrounding nonhabitat; and
   activity budgets of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) inhabiting two
   forest fragments-Anja Special Reserve and Tsaranoro Valley Sacred
   Forest-in Madagascar's central highlands to test the prediction that
   intraspecific variation in habitat use and activity patterns is
   indicative of fragment quality. At Anja, Lemur catta has access to
   abundant year-round anthropogenic resources (introduced fruit trees,
   agricultural crops, water), whereas the population at Tsaranoro relies
   on seasonally variable and patchily distributed resources throughout the
   forest and matrix. Lemur catta at Anja occupy smaller home ranges; have
   shorter daily path lengths (DPLs); and spend less time foraging and more
   time resting, locomoting, and engaging in social and territorial
   behavior. In contrast, groups at Tsaranoro occupy larger home ranges,
   have longer DPLs, rely heavily on the matrix, and expend most of their
   energy in foraging behavior. These differences point to variation in the
   relative habitat quality of the two fragments and are thus an important
   consideration for conservation managers when assessing the capacity of
   forest fragments to sustain populations.},

Abstract = {Teeth have long been used as indicators of primate ecology. Early work
   focused on the links between dental morphology, diet, and behavior, with
   more recent years emphasizing dental wear, microstructure, development,
   and biogeochemistry, to understand primate ecology. Our study of Lemur
   catta at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar, has revealed an
   unusual pattern of severe tooth wear and frequent tooth loss, primarily
   the result of consuming a fallback food for which these primates are not
   dentally adapted. Interpreting these data was only possible by combining
   our areas of expertise (dental anatomy {[}FC] and primate ecology
   {[}MS]). By integrating theoretical, methodological, and applied aspects
   of both areas of research, we adopted the term dental ecologydefined as
   the broad study of how teeth respond to the environment. Specifically,
   we view dental ecology as an interpretive framework using teeth as a
   vehicle for understanding an organism's ecology, which builds upon
   earlier work, but creates a new synthesis of anatomy and ecology that is
   only possible with detailed knowledge of living primates. This framework
   includes (1) identifying patterns of dental pathology and tooth
   use-wear, within the context of feeding ecology, behavior, habitat
   variation, and anthropogenic change, (2) assessing ways in which dental
   development and biogeochemical signals can reflect habitat,
   environmental change and/or stress, and (3) how dental microstructure
   and macro-morphology are adapted to, and reflect feeding ecology. Here
   we define dental ecology, provide a short summary of the development of
   this perspective, and place our new work into this context. Am J Phys

Title = {Spatial Ecology of the Endangered Milne-Edwards' Sifaka (Propithecus

   Patterns?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},

Abstract = {Primates often live in human-altered habitats; Malagasy lemurs are no
   exception. It is important to understand if habitat alteration affects
   primates' space use patterns across multiple spatial and temporal
   scales, as this drives population density. We quantified the daily,
   seasonal, and annual space-use of seven groups of Milne-Edwards' sifaka
   (Propithecus edwardsi) living in unlogged and logged rain forest in
   Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar between December 2002 and November
   2003. Concurrent data showed that sifakas consumed higher quality foods
   in the unlogged than in logged forests; thus we explored how space use
   patterns were related to energy use strategies. Sifaka groups in the
   logged rain forest traveled 7-13\% less per day than groups in the
   unlogged rain forest, despite their larger home ranges (median: 46.12
   and 23.52 ha, in the logged and unlogged forests, respectively). Sifakas
   may thus use an energy-minimizing strategy at the scale of the
   individual day but an energy-maximizing strategy at the annual home
   range scale. Sifakas exhibited fidelity to the home range across
   seasons, but their core area of use shifted considerably with season. We
   found no difference in population density between sites. However, given
   the interannual variability in sifaka foods, a multiyear study is needed
   to assess if energy strategies observed in this study are consistent
   across longer time periods. Our findings suggest that lemurs may persist
   in logged habitats by altering spatial use patterns; future work should
   attempt to quantify the threshold level of forest regeneration from
   logging that will allow lemurs to persist at similar densities as in
   unlogged forest.},

Title = {Mapping the social network: tracking lice in a wild primate (Microcebus
   rufus) population to infer social contacts and vector potential},
Journal = {BMC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {Background: Studies of host-parasite interactions have the potential to
   provide insights into the ecology of both organisms involved. We
   monitored the movement of sucking lice (Lemurpediculus verruculosus),
   parasites that require direct host-host contact to be transferred, in
   their host population of wild mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus). These
   lemurs live in the rainforests of Madagascar, are small (40 g),
   arboreal, nocturnal, solitary foraging primates for which data on
   population-wide interactions are difficult to obtain. We developed a
   simple, cost effective method exploiting the intimate relationship
   between louse and lemur, whereby individual lice were marked, without
   removal from their host, with an individualized code, and tracked
   throughout the lemur population. We then tested the hypotheses that 1)
   the frequency of louse transfers, and thus interactions, would decrease
   with increasing distance between paired individual lemurs; 2) due to
   host polygynandry, social interactions and hence louse transfers would
   increase during the onset of the breeding season; and 3) individual
   mouse lemurs would vary in their contributions to the spread of lice.
   Results: We show that louse transfers involved 43.75\% of the studied
   lemur population, exclusively males. Louse transfers peaked during the
   breeding season, perhaps due to increased social interactions between
   lemurs. Although trap-based individual lemur ranging patterns are
   restricted, louse transfer rate does not correlate with the distance
   between lemur trapping locales, indicating wider host ranging behavior
   and a greater risk of rapid population-wide pathogen transmission than
   predicted by standard trapping data alone. Furthermore, relatively few
   lemur individuals contributed disproportionately to the rapid spread of
   lice throughout the population.
   Conclusions: Using a simple method, we were able to visualize exchanges
   of lice in a population of cryptic wild primates. This method not only
   provided insight into the previously unseen parasite movement between
   lemurs, but also allowed us to infer social interactions between them.
   As lice are known pathogen vectors, our method also allowed us to
   identify the lemurs most likely to facilitate louse-mediated epidemics.
   Our approach demonstrates the potential to uncover otherwise
   inaccessible parasite-host, and host social interaction data in any
   trappable species parasitized by sucking lice.},

Abstract = {Sexual dimorphism is common in polygynous species, where intrasexual
   competition is often thought to drive the evolution of large male body
   size, and in turn, male behavioral dominance over females. In
   Madagascar, the entire lemur radiation, which embraces diverse mating
   systems, lacks sexual dimorphism and exhibits frequent female dominance
   over males. The evolution of such morphological and behavioral
   peculiarities, often referred to as the lemur syndrome, has proven
   difficult to understand. Among other hypotheses, a potential role of
   intersexual selection has been repeatedly proposed but hardly ever
   tested. Here, we investigate whether female choice favors small and
   compliant males, and whether male choice favors large females in captive
   gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). Detailed analysis of a
   combination of behavioral observations and hormonal data available for
   both sexes shows that (1) females accept more matings from males with
   higher fighting abilities, (2) males adjust their investment in
   intrasexual competition to female fertility, and (3) both male and
   female strategies are weakly influenced by the body mass of potential
   partners, in directions contradicting our predictions. These results do
   not suggest a prominent role of intersexual selection in the evolution
   and maintenance of the lemur syndrome but rather point to alternative
   mechanisms relating to malemale competition, specifically highlighting
   an absence of relationship between male body mass and fighting ability.
   Finally, our findings add to the growing body of evidence suggesting
   flexible sex roles, by showing the expression of mutual mate choice in a
   female-dominant, sexually monomorphic and promiscuous primate. Am J Phys

Title = {Evolutionary disequilibrium and activity period in primates: A bayesian

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Activity period plays a central role in studies of primate origins and
   adaptations, yet fundamental questions remain concerning the
   evolutionary history of primate activity period. Lemurs are of
   particular interest because they display marked variation in activity
   period, with some species exhibiting completely nocturnal or diurnal
   lifestyles, and others distributing activity throughout the 24-h cycle
   (i.e., cathemerality). Some lines of evidence suggest that cathemerality
   in lemurs is a recent and transient evolutionary state (i.e., the
   evolutionary disequilibrium hypothesis), while other studies indicate
   that cathemerality is a stable evolutionary strategy with a more ancient
   history. Debate also surrounds activity period in early primate
   evolution, with some recent studies casting doubt on the traditional
   hypothesis that basal primates were nocturnal. Here, we used Bayesian
   phylogenetic methods to reconstruct activity period at key points in
   primate evolution. Counter to the evolutionary disequilibrium
   hypothesis, the most recent common ancestor of Eulemur was reconstructed
   as cathemeral at similar to 913 million years ago, indicating that
   cathemerality in lemurs is a stable evolutionary strategy. We found
   strong evidence favoring a nocturnal ancestor for all primates,
   strepsirrhines and lemurs, which adds to previous findings based on
   parsimony by providing quantitative support for these reconstructions.
   Reconstructions for the haplorrhine ancestor were more equivocal, but
   diurnality was favored for simian primates. We discuss the implications
   of our models for the evolutionary disequilibrium hypothesis, and we
   identify avenues for future research that would provide new insights
   into the evolution of cathemerality in lemurs. Am J Phys Anthropol 2012.

Title = {Leaf nutritional quality as a predictor of primate biomass: further

Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {28},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The correlation between the biomass of forest primates and a chemical
   index of the average nutritional quality of leaves in tropical forests
   has been repeatedly documented since 1990. We tested the role played by
   protein : fibre on lemur biomass in a gallery forest in southern
   Madagascar. Plant species abundance was determined based on transect
   censuses. We calculated an average ratio of protein-to-fibre in leaves
   and an abundance-weighted ratio, i.e. the mean weighted by the basal
   area of tree species, to be compared with the figures available for
   other forest ecosystems in Madagascar and a number of anthropoid
   habitats. Lemur densities were evaluated through compilation of previous
   studies made from prior to 1975 and up until 2011 based on strip
   censuses and/or identification of all groups supplemented with new
   censuses. A high mean ratio of protein to fibre (>0.4) supports high
   folivore biomass at 390 kg km(-2) (reaching 630 kg km(-2) in the
   closed-canopy forest area) compared with primate communities in other
   Malagasy forests (protein : fibre: <0.5; folivore biomass: <440 kg
   km(-2)), as predicted. However, the data corroborate the finding that
   the total biomass of lemur communities as well as the biomass of
   folivorous lemur species are low compared with those of African and
   Asian primate communities for a given protein : fibre ratio. Tree
   diversity and leaf production do not consistently explain this pattern.
   In contrast, the extinction of large folivorous lemurs during the past
   two millennia presumably allowed too little time for smaller-sized
   species to evolve equally effective morphological and physiological
   specializations for processing a large range of fibrous foods.},

Title = {Distribution and Morphological Variation of Microcebus spp. Along an
   Environmental Gradient in Southeastern Madagascar},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1037-1057},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The lemurs of Madagascar are known for their extraordinary levels of
   speciation. However, the mechanisms and environmental conditions that
   led to this diversity remain obscure. We used 3 species of Microcebus
   (M. griseorufus, M. murinus, M. rufus) occurring along an environmental
   gradient as a model to investigate 1) how the different species are
   distributed in relation to variation in environmental conditions and
   ecotones; 2) whether or not the morphology of a given species varies in
   relation to environmental conditions; and 3) whether or not there is
   evidence for morphological character displacement to reduce congeneric
   competition in sympatry vs. allopatry. The 3 species of Microcebus show
   clear associations with specific habitat types. Distributions overlap at
   ecotones. Nevertheless, the ecotone between dry spiny and gallery forest
   represents a species boundary between Microcebus griseorufus and M.
   murinus while the ecotone between dry spiny forest and evergreen humid
   forest represents the species boundary between M. murinus and M. rufus.
   Different ambient conditions are not reflected in changes in body
   measurements of Microcebus murinus living in different vegetation
   formations. There is no indication for character displacement in
   sympatry vs. allopatry. Thus, differences in body mass or other
   morphological characteristics do not contribute to species separation
   between Microcebus griseorufus and M. murinus. The results confirm the
   importance of ecotones as species boundaries as a condition postulated
   for the radiation of lemur and other species on Madagascar. They also
   demonstrate different habitat affinities of seemingly very similar lemur
   species and thus illustrate our very limited understanding of the actual
   selection pressures, adaptations of lemurs to their environments, and
   their possible response to interspecific competition.},

Volume = {73},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic habitat disturbance impairs ecosystem health by
   fragmenting forested areas, introducing environmental contamination, and
   reducing the quality of habitat resources. The effect of this
   disturbance on wildlife health is of particular concern in Madagascar,
   one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, where anthropogenic pressures
   on the environment remain high. Despite the conservation importance of
   threatened lemur populations in Madagascar, few data exist on the
   effects of anthropogenic disturbance on lemur health. To examine these
   impacts, indri (Indri indri) populations were evaluated from two forest
   reserves that differ in their exposure to anthropogenic disturbance. We
   compared the health status of 36 indri individuals from two sites: one
   population from a protected, undisturbed area of lowland evergreen humid
   forest and the other population from a reserve exposed to frequent
   tourism and forest degradation. Comparison of indri health parameters
   between sites suggests an impact of anthropogenic disturbance, including
   significant differences in leukocyte count and differential, 12 serum
   parameters, 6 trace minerals, and a higher diversity of parasites, with
   a significant difference in the presence of the louse, Trichophilopterus
   babakotophilus. These data suggest that indri living in disturbed
   forests may experience physiological changes and increased
   susceptibility to parasitism, which may ultimately impair reproductive
   success and survival. Am. J. Primatol. 73:632-642, 2011. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Phylogeny of the mite subfamily Makialginae, permanent and highly
   specialized ectoparasites of strepsirrhine primates distributed in
   Madagascar and tropical Africa, was inferred based on morphology under
   maximum parsimony: Galagalges (Cheirogalalges (Makialges
   (Daubentonialges (Lemuralges, Gaudalges)))). Historical associations
   were reconstructed by fitting the mite tree onto alternative host
   topologies. Results of coevolutionary analyses highlight the disparity
   between morphological and molecular hypotheses on the host evolutionary
   history. Although phylogenetic relationships of strepsirrhine primates
   based on the morphological hypothesis returned significant fits to our
   parasite tree, the most recent molecular hypothesis of host phylogeny
   resulted in no coevolutionary scenario being different from random.
   Based on the former reconstructions, we hypothesize that present
   associations of Daubentoniidae, the earliest derivative extant family of
   Malagasy primates, acquired the present mite species via extinction of
   their original parasites and subsequent re-colonization by parasites
   from derived lemuriform families. Our data suggest that extant
   associations between Malagasy lemurs and their mites resulted from a
   single ancient codispersal to Madagascar from Africa. However, because
   of the host switch in Daubentoniidae, alternative, but less
   parsimonious, scenarios are possible. Our analyses indirectly support
   the hypothesis of the monophyletic origin of the infraorder
   Lemuriformes, the superfamily Lemuroidea, and the sister-group
   relationships between the families Lemuridae and Indriidae. (C) 2011 The

Title = {Effects of Seasonality on Brain Size Evolution: Evidence from

Abstract = {Seasonal changes in energy supply impose energetic constraints that
   affect many physiological and behavioral characteristics of organisms.
   As brains are costly, we predict brain size to be relatively small in
   species that experience a higher degree of seasonality (expensive brain
   framework). Alternatively, it has been argued that larger brains give
   animals the behavioral flexibility to buffer the effects of habitat
   seasonality (cognitive buffer hypothesis). Here, we test these two
   hypotheses in a comparative study on strepsirrhine primates (African
   lorises and Malagasy lemurs) that experience widely varying degrees of
   seasonality. We found that experienced seasonality is negatively
   correlated with relative brain size in both groups, controlling for the
   effect of phylogenetic relationships and possible confounding variables
   such as the extent of folivory. However, relatively larger-brained lemur
   species tend to experience less variation in their dietary intake than
   indicated by the seasonality of their habitat. In conclusion, we found
   clear support for the hypothesis that seasonality restricts brain size
   in strepsirrhines as predicted by the expensive brain framework and weak
   support for the cognitive buffer hypothesis in lemurs.},

Abstract = {Sexual selection theory predicts that potential mates or competitors
   signal their quality to conspecifics. Whereas evidence of honest visual
   or vocal signals in males abounds, evidence of honest signalling via
   scent or by females is scarce. We previously showed that scent marks in
   male lemurs seasonally encode information about individual
   heterozygosity - a reliable predictor of immunocompetence and
   survivorship. As female lemurs dominate males, compete over resources,
   and produce sexually differentiated scent marks that likely evolved via
   direct selection, here we tested whether females also advertise genetic
   quality via olfactory cues. During the breeding season specifically,
   individual heterozygosity correlated negatively with the diversity of
   fatty acids (FAs) expressed in labial secretions and positively with the
   diversity of heavy FA esters. As odour-gene relationships predictive of
   health and survivorship emerged during a period critical to mate choice
   and female competition, we posit that genital scent marks function as
   honest olfactory ornaments in females.},

Title = {Non-invasive conservation genetics of the critically endangered

Journal = {CONSERVATION GENETICS},

Abstract = {The genetic structure of the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus
   tattersalli) was evaluated in three forest types in the Daraina region
   between the Loky and Manambato Rivers in northeastern Madagascar. This
   critically endangered lemur species, only found within this restricted
   region (similar to 1,300 km(2)), comprises populations which survive in
   forest fragments of varying size. While this remote region is already
   affected by human deforestation, the scheduled paving of the national
   road can potentially bring significant changes in the near future. In
   2006, sifakas feces from 82 putative individuals were collected
   immediately after defecation. DNA samples were genotyped at 13
   microsatellite loci to characterize patterns of genetic diversity within
   and among three sets of forest fragments representing different
   ecological types. The recent 2CTAB/PCI extraction method and the
   `comparative' genotype validation approach allowed us to significantly
   improve the efficiency of amplification procedures. We found that
   golden-crowned sifaka genetic diversity was surprisingly high despite
   its narrow distribution and the current level of habitat fragmentation.
   We used both spatial and non-spatial Bayesian clustering methods to
   determine if forest edges correlated with cryptic genetic clusters and
   found that it was overall the case. However, the results also indicate
   that migrations are possible between two of the three studied forest
   complexes despite the presence of the national road. This is probably
   due to remaining riparian and small forest patches between these two
   forest complexes. The third forest complex is more differentiated
   although some migrations/connections may still exist through non-sampled
   fragments. This strongly suggests that it is necessary to maintain
   corridors and small patches, and also to explore the genetic diversity
   of the fragments outside the protected area.},

Abstract = {Lemur grooming has received very little attention in the literature.
   Nevertheless, allogrooming in lemurs has been suggested to be
   fundamentally different from the grooming of anthropoids. One reason is
   that lemurs generally rely on oral rather than manual grooming. Lemur
   allogrooming has also been suggested to serve less of a social function
   than has been attributed to anthropoid grooming. I analyzed the
   allogrooming behaviors of 29 Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi)
   living in five social groups in the Kirindy Forest of Madagascar. Based
   upon 1,586 observation hours, I found that sifaka, like anthropoids,
   spend very little time mutual grooming (2 +/- 3\%). Half of all
   allogrooming involved parts of the body that could have been easily
   groomed by the recipient, such as the limbs. Even though ectoparasite
   loads are expected to be greater during the rainy season, allogrooming
   did not increase during the rainy season. Allogrooming rates were
   influenced by both rank and sex, and increased by 50-100\% during the
   mating season. The results of this study suggest that allogrooming in
   Verreaux's sifaka plays an important social function, even though it is
   performed with a toothcomb. Am. J. Primatol. 72:254-261, 2010. (C) 2009

Abstract = {Neoplastic diseases in prosimians have been sporadically reported in the
   literature. To provide a comprehensive review of prosimian neoplasia, a
   retrospective evaluation of neoplasia in a large captive prosimian
   colony and an extensive literature review were performed. Primates that
   belong to the Order Primata, Suborder Prosimii with histologic evidence
   of neoplasia were included. One hundred twenty-three cases of
   spontaneous neoplasia were identified in 101 prosimians from the Duke
   Lemur Center, and 124 cases were reported in 116 prosimians in the
   literature. Overall, this review compiled a total of 247 neoplasms in
   217 prosimians. Of the 217 affected animals, 88 of 217 were males
   (41\%), 100 of 217 were females (46\%), and sex was not reported in 29
   of 217 (13\%). Ages ranged from 2 days to 36 years. Prosimian families
   represented were Lemuridae (80/217 {[}37\%]), Cheirogaleidae (61/217
   {[}28\%]), Galagidae (44/217 {[}20\%]), Lorisidae (28/217 {[}13\%]), and
   Indriidae (4/217 {[}2\%]). The most commonly affected species were the
   gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) (28/217 {[}13\%]), thick-tailed
   greater bush baby (Otolemur crassicaudatus) (23/217 {[}11\%]) and black
   lemur (Eulemur macaco) (19/217 {[}9\%]). Organ systems affected, in
   order of descending occurrence, were digestive (75/247 {[}30\%]),
   reproductive (40/247 {[}16\%]), hematopoietic (34/247 {[}14\%]),
   integumentary (28/247 {[}11\%] endocrine (26/247 {[}11\%]) and urinary
   (17/247 {[}7\%]). The respiratory, nervous, musculoskeletal, and
   cardiovascular systems were infrequently affected. The most common
   neoplasms were hepatocellular (32/247 {[}13\%]), lymphoma and/or
   leukemia (29/247 {[}12\%]), biliary (15/247 {[}6\%]), and mammary
   neoplasms (12/247 {[}5\%)]). This article should serve as a valuable
   reference for the types and relative frequencies of neoplasms that occur

Abstract = {Lentiviruses chronically infect a broad range of mammalian species and
   have been transmitted from primates to humans, giving rise to multiple
   outbreaks of HIV infection over the past century. Although the
   circumstances surrounding these recent zoonoses are becoming clearer,
   the nature and timescale of interaction between lentiviruses and
   primates remains unknown. Here, we report the discovery of an endogenous
   lentivirus in the genome of the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), a
   strepsirrhine primate from Madagascar, demonstrating that lentiviruses
   are capable of invading the primate germ line. Phylogenetic analysis
   places gray mouse lemur prosimian immunodeficiency virus (pSIVgml) basal
   to all known primate lentiviruses and, consistent with this, its genomic
   organization is intermediate between the nonprimate lentiviruses and
   their more derived primate counterparts. Thus, pSIVgml represents the
   first unambiguous example of a viral transitional form, revealing the
   acquisition and loss of genomic features during lentiviral evolution.
   Furthermore, because terrestrial mammal populations in Madagascar and
   Africa are likely to have been isolated from one another for at least 14
   million years, the presence of pSIVgml in the gray mouse lemur genome
   indicates that lentiviruses must have been infecting primates for at
   least this period of time, or have been transmitted between Malagasy and
   African primate populations by a vector species capable of traversing
   the Mozambique channel. The discovery of pSIVgml illustrates the utility
   of endogenous sequences for the study of contemporary retroviruses and

Title = {Relief index of second mandibular molars is a correlate of diet among

Abstract = {This study describes and tests a new method of calculating a shape
   metric known as the relief index (RFI) on lower second molars of extant
   euarchontan mammals, including scandentians (treeshrews), dermopterans
   (flying lemurs), and prosimian primates (strepsirhines and tarsiers).
   RFI is the ratio of the tooth crown three-dimensional area to
   two-dimensional planar area. It essentially expresses hypsodonty and
   complexity of tooth shape. Like other measurements of complexity, RFI
   ignores taxon-specific features, such as certain cusps and crests, which
   are usually considered in more traditional studies of tooth function.
   Traditional statistical analyses of the study sample show that RFI
   distinguishes taxa with differing amounts of structural carbohydrates in
   their diets, with frugivore/gramnivores being significantly lower in RFI
   than omnivores, and insectivores/folivores being significantly higher in
   RFI than the other two. Information on absolute size, or body mass, is
   needed to reliably parse out insectivores and folivores; however, if the
   study sample is limited to Primates, RFI alone distinguishes many
   folivores (lower) from insectivores (higher). Finally, phylogenetically
   independent contrasts of RFI and dietary preference are strongly
   correlated with one another, indicating that variance in RFI is better
   explained by dietary diversity than phylogenetic affinity in this
   sample. Because of the accuracy and phylogenetic insensitivity of the
   RFI among Euarchonta, this method can be applied to fossil primates and
   stem-primates (plesiadapiforms) and used to elucidate and compare their
   dietary preferences. Such comparisons are important for developing a
   more detailed view of primate evolution. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Male Aggression During Mating: Evidence for Sexual Coercion in a Female

Abstract = {In this article we document male sexual coercion of a Lemur catta Female
   on St. Catherines Island (SCI), USA. Data presented in this paper were
   collected on one free-ranging L. catta group during October-November
   2002 using all-occurrences sampling for agonism and reproductive
   behavior. We observed a male forcefully attempting to mate with a
   year-old estrous female. Despite the fact that we observed this female
   to present to the male during her estrus, throughout the episode the
   male employed the use of force, and achieved penile intromission on at
   least one occasion while the Female struggled and resisted. We interpret
   his behavior as sexual coercion. As measured by sexual presents, the
   female appeared to more strongly prefer two other males as mates, yet
   each of these males gait-led Fewer mounts and less cumulative tin-le
   spent in mounts than the coercive male. The coercive male was one of two
   group males with the lowest observed mating success, suggesting that
   coercion might be a strategy used by males who are not highly sexually
   preferred. Females undergo early sexual maturation at this site owing to
   provisioning, and can therefore enter estrus before Fully attaining
   dominance over males. As such, these data suggest that one consequence
   of provisioning a wild L. catta population (or of maintaining L. catta
   in captivity) may be that young females can be the targets of sexual
   coercion if they reach sexual maturity before Fully achieving social
   dominance over males. In conclusion, male sexual coercion can occur in
   L. catta despite the Female dominance characteristic of this species,
   and can constrain the mating behavior of females. Am. J. Primatol.

Abstract = {Mate choice is one of the most important evolutionary mechanisms.
   Females can improve their fitness by selectively mating with certain
   males. We studied possible genetic benefits in the obligate pair-living
   fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius) which maintains life-long
   pair bonds but has an extremely high rate of extra-pair paternity.
   Possible mechanisms of female mate choice were investigated by analyzing
   overall genetic variability (neutral microsatellite marker) as well as a
   marker of adaptive significance (major histocompatibility complex,
   MHC-DRB exon 2). As in human medical studies, MHC-alleles were grouped
   to MHC-supertypes based on similarities in their functional important
   antigen binding sites. The study indicated that females preferred males
   both as social and as genetic fathers for their offspring having a
   higher number of MHC-alleles and MHC-supertypes, a lower overlap with
   female's MHC-supertypes as well as a higher genome wide heterozygosity
   than randomly assigned males. Mutual relatedness had no influence on
   mate choice. Females engaged in extra-pair mating shared a significant
   higher number of MHC-supertypes with their social partner than faithful
   females. As no genetic differences between extra-pair young (EPY) and
   intra-pair young (IPY) were found, females might engage in extra-pair
   mating to `correct' for genetic incompatibility. Thus, we found evidence
   that mate choice is predicted in the first place by the
   `good-genes-as-heterozygosity hypothesis' whereas the occurrence of
   extra-pair matings supports the `dissassortative mating hypothesis'. To
   the best of our knowledge this study represents the first investigation
   of the potential roles of MHC-genes and overall genetic diversity in
   mate choice and extra-pair partner selection in a natural, free-living
   population of non-human primates.},

Title = {Social complexity predicts transitive reasoning in prosimian primates},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {76},
Number = {2},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Transitive inference is a form of deductive reasoning that has been
   suggested as one cognitive mechanism by which animals could learn the
   many relationships within their group's dominance hierarchy. This
   process thus bears relevance to the social intelligence hypothesis,
   which posits evolutionary links between various forms of social and
   nonsocial cognition. Recent evidence corroborates the link between
   social complexity and transitive inference and indicates that highly
   social animals may show superior transitive reasoning even in nonsocial
   contexts. We examined the relationship between social complexity and
   transitive inference in two species of prosimians, a group of primates
   that diverged from the common ancestor of monkeys, apes and humans over
   50 million years ago. In experiment 1, highly social ringtailed lemurs,
   Lemur catta, outperformed the less social mongoose lemurs, Eulemur
   mongoz, in tests of transitive inference and showed more robust
   representations of the underlying ordinal relationships between the
   stimuli. In experiment 2, after training under a correction procedure
   that emphasized the underlying linear dimension of the series, both
   species showed similar transitive inference. This finding suggests that
   the two lemur species differ not in their fundamental ability to make
   transitive inferences, but rather in their predisposition to mentally
   organize information along a common underlying dimension. Together,
   these results support the hypothesis that social complexity is an
   important selective pressure for the evolution of cognitive abilities
   relevant to transitive reasoning. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {Sportive lemurs constitute a highly diverse endemic lemur family (24
   species) for which many biogeographic boundaries are not yet clarified.
   Based on recent phylogeographic models, this study aims to determine the
   importance of two large rivers (the Antainambalana and Rantanabe) in
   northeastern Madagascar as species barriers for Lepilemur seali. The
   Antainambalana River was previously assumed to act as the southern
   border of its distribution. A total of 1,038 bp of the mtDNA of four
   individuals stemming from two adjacent inter-river systems south of the
   Antainambalana River was sequenced and compared to sequences of 22
   described Lepilemur species. The phylogenetic reconstruction did not
   find support for either of the two rivers as species barrier for
   Lepilemur, as all captured individuals clustered closely with and
   therefore belonged to L. seali. However, a previously published sequence
   of an individual from a site south of our study sites belongs to a
   separate species. The southern boundary of L. seali must therefore be
   one of two large rivers further south of our study sites. The results
   suggest that L. seali may possess a relatively large altitudinal range
   that enabled this species to migrate around the headwaters of the
   Antainambalana and Rantanabe Rivers. Previous phylogeographic models
   need to be refined in order to incorporate these findings, and more
   species-specific altitudinal range data are urgently needed in order to
   fully understand the biogeographic patterns of lemurs on Madagascar.},

Abstract = {I examined the reproductive status of female brown mouse lemurs
   (Microcebus rufus) from October 2005 to early January, 2006 at
   Ranomafana National Park, an eastern rain forest in Madagascar. I
   employed intensive capture/mark/recapture techniques to track individual
   changes in vaginal morphology and body mass and collected vaginal smears
   for individuals with open vaginas. I observed moderate estrous synchrony
   (vaginal openings between October 11 and November 18), with clusters of
   females showing strong estrous synchrony (6 of 15 on or around October
   15, and 3 of 15 on or around October 25). My findings weakly support the
   proximity hypothesis-that closer females will enter estrus
   simultaneously-and offer virtually no support for the notion that body
   mass influences the timing of estrus in brown mouse lemurs. Females gave
   birth during the second and third weeks of December. Two females showing
   signs of abortion or perinatal death of offspring also showed renewed
   vaginal swelling in late December, suggesting that some form of
   polyestry, i.e., as reproductive compensation for infant loss, exists at
   Ranomafana. I discuss the implications of the data, in conjunction with
   other evidence of polyestry in wild mouse lemurs, in light of data on
   patterns of seasonality at Ranomafana and other sites. More data are
   needed to determine the frequency and pattern of polyestry in Microcebus
   rufus.},

Title = {Using extant patterns of dental variation to identify species in the

Abstract = {Patterns of extant primate dental variation provide important data for
   interpreting taxonomic boundaries in fossil forms. Here I use dental
   data from several well-known living primates (as well as data from
   selected Eocene forms) to evaluate dental variation in Middle Eocene
   Omomys, the first North American fossil primate identified by
   paleontologists. Measurements were collected from a sample of 148
   omomyid dental specimens recovered from Bridger B localities in the
   Bridger Basin, Wyoming. Most of these specimens have not previously been
   described. Nonmetric traits were also scored for this sample. Lower
   molar coefficients of variation range from 4.01 for M-2 length (n = 80)
   to 6.73 for M-3 talonid width (n = 57). All of the nonmetric traits
   scored exhibit less than 100\% presence in the overall sample, including
   traits previously described as representative of Omomys (e.g., P-4
   metaconids present in 91\%, n = 55; M-2 pericones present in 80\%, n =
   15). Dental traits also vary in a set of spatially restricted localities
   from the same fossil horizon and in a separate, single fossil locality
   (DMNH 868, P-4 metaconids present in 67\%, n = 6). An increasing
   frequency in several premolar traits across time in these more
   restricted samples suggests an anagenetic change in Bridger B Omomys.
   However, this degree of morphological variability is consistent with
   that seen in extant primate species from single locations. Metric
   variation in this sample is comparable to that seen in other Eocene
   primates, such as new data presented here for the omomyid Arapahovius
   gazini from the Washakie Basin, southern Wyoming. Omomys metric
   variation is also comparable to that found in several samples of
   well-known extant primates from single localities (e.g., ring-tailed
   lemurs and gray-brown mouse lemurs). These metric data also correspond
   to the patterns of variability described in previously published studies
   of Omomys carteri. In sum, a single species interpretation (O. carteri)
   for this new Bridger B Omomys sample from southern Wyoming is affirmed,
   and this study illustrates the usefulness of dental data from extant
   primates for evaluating primate fossil samples.},

Title = {Does Eulemur cinereiceps exist? Preliminary evidence from genetics and
   ground surveys in southeastern Madagascar},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4},
Pages = {372-385},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Although appearing in the literature as early as 1890, the brown lemur
   form Eulemur cinereiceps has recently resurfaced as a potentially valid
   taxon, distinct from neighboring, presumably closely related species
   such as white-collared lemurs (Eulemur albocollaris). We propose two
   scenarios for the potential separation of E. cinereiceps and E.
   albocollaris: (1) coastal and interior populations represent two
   distinct taxa and (2) the coastal population north of the Manampatrana
   River (the locality for purported museum specimens of E. cinereiceps)
   represents a distinct species from E. albocollaris found south of the
   river and in the interior escarpment forests. We tested these hypotheses
   using data from ground surveys and genetic sampling. Surveys were
   conducted in coastal forest fragments both north and south of the
   Manampatrana River in July-August 2006. Genetic samples were collected
   at two coastal sites and one interior forest. We used maximum parsimony,
   maximum likelihood, and neighbor-joining analyses on mitochondrial DNA
   regions to determine if populations from different sites clustered into
   diagnosable clades. Results from field surveys confirmed the presence of
   forms commonly referred to as E. albocollaris at the two southern
   coastal forests; no consistent phenotypic differences across sites were
   observed. All genetic analyses yielded identical results: coastal and
   interior populations do not cluster into separate groups, thus rejecting
   the first hypothesis. Eulemur species and all other day-active lemurs
   have apparently been extirpated from coastal forests north of the
   Manampatrana. Owing to the absence of lemurs from the northern coastal
   localities, we could not conclusively support or reject the second
   scenario. However, based on examination of the original plates and
   museum specimens, as well as the biogeographic patterns typical of this
   region, we strongly suspect that all populations from this area belong
   to a single species. We conclude with remarks regarding the apparent
   priority of E. cinereiceps for this taxon.},

Title = {Ranging behavior and possible correlates of pair-living in southeastern

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {153-171},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Researchers have proposed several hypotheses to explain pair-living in
   primates. In particular, when males are not involved in direct parental
   care, pair-living may be related to female dispersal, infanticide
   prevention, or male mate/resource defense. We aimed to evaluate, through
   a better understanding of the ranging patterns of avahis, which
   hypotheses may best account for pair-living in these nocturnal lemurs.
   We collected focal observations over 26 nights, June-September 2004, in
   a littoral forest (Sainte Luce, southeastern Madagascar) on 4 adult
   radiocollared avahis {[}Avahi laniger (Tattersall, I. (1982). The
   Primates of Madagascar. Columbia University Press, New York.) or Avahi
   meridionalis (Zaramody in Primate Reports 74:9-22, 2006)]. We followed 2
   males and 2 females from 2 groups: B, a male-female couple, and A,
   comprising the parental pair and 1-yr-old female offspring. The adult
   females birthed in August. We recorded resting and feeding tree points
   (via global positioning system) for home range calculation through
   minimum convex polygon and kernel methods. We provide the first
   quantitative information on the ranging behavior of 2 male and 2 female
   avahis. Home range/daily path length values (means) are higher than the
   ones previously reported for the same and other folivorous pair-living
   lemur species. On average, the 2 females spent more time feeding and
   traveled shorter distances than the 2 males did. Male-female cohesion
   (mean values), possibly enhanced by offspring presence, was higher in A
   and after births than in B and before births, respectively. Although
   male avahis may be forced into pair-living owing to energy constraints
   related to size, locomotion, and diet, females might accept pair-living
   in exchange for indirect territory defense and mate guarding.},

Abstract = {We investigated the feeding ecology of Eulemur macaco macaco in an old
   coastal secondary forest of northwestern Madagascar. We analyzed whether
   the local combination of introduced and native plant species could
   provide viable anthropic conditions for sustaining the black lemurs.
   Fruits (79 spp.) dominated the annual diet (> 104 species from 50
   families via observations ad libitum and use of a feeding frequency
   methods). Records from the early dry (mating) and late dry (birth)
   seasons show that a few major fruit species are staples in conjunction
   with a variety of other plant items in much lower proportions. We
   further estimated daily food intake and analyzed nutrient/antinutrient
   content in the diet during the birth season to evaluate the possibility
   that black lemurs undergo nutritional stress. They exhibited a
   high-energy input/low energy output foraging strategy then and had
   limited use of alternative resources such as leaves throughout the study
   period. We conclude that the potential for feeding flexibility is low
   because specialization on fruit results in protein requirements being
   achieved probably by a narrow margin. We hypothesize that patchy
   distribution of preferred cash-crop plants and indigenous species
   currently has a major limiting effect on population size through feeding
   competition.},

Title = {Body size and scaling of the hands and feet of prosimian primates},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {133},
Number = {2},
Pages = {828-840},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The hands and feet of primates fulfill a variety of biological roles
   linked with food acquisition and positional behavior. Current
   explanations of shape differences in cheiridial morphology among
   prosimians are closely tied to body size differences. Although numerous
   studies have examined the relationships between body mass and limb
   morphology in prosimians, no scaling analysis has specifically
   considered hand and foot dimensions and intrinsic proportions. In this
   study, we present such an analysis for a sample of 270 skeletal
   specimens distributed over eight prosimian families. The degree of
   association between size and shape was assessed using nonparametric
   correlational techniques, while the relationship between each ray
   element length and body mass (from published data and a body mass
   surrogate) was tested for allometric scaling. Since tarsiers and
   strepsirrhines encompass many taxa of varying degrees of phylogenetic
   relatedness, effective degrees of freedom were calculated, and
   comparisons between families were performed to partially address the
   problem of statistical nonindependence and ``phylogenetic inertia.{''}
   Correlational analyses indicate negative allometry between relative
   phalangeal length (as reflected by phalangeal indices) and body mass,
   except for the pollex and hallux. Thus, as size increases, there is a
   significant decrease in the relative length of the digits when
   considering all prosimian taxa sampled. Regression analyses show that
   while the digital portion of the rays scales isometrically with body
   mass, the palmar/plantar portion of the rays often scales with positive
   allometry. Some but not all of these broadly interspecific allometric
   patterns remain statistically significant when effective degrees of
   freedom are taken into account. As is often the case in interspecific
   scaling, comparisons within families show different scaling trends in
   the cheiridia than those seen across families (i.e., lorisids, indriids,
   and lemurids exhibit rather different allometries). The interspecific
   pattern of positive allometry that appears to best characterize the
   metapodials of prosimians, especially those of the foot, parallels
   differences found in the morphology of the volar skin. Indeed,
   relatively longer metapodials appear to covary with flatter and more
   coalesced volar pads, which in turn slightly improve frictional force
   for animals that are at a comparative disadvantage while climbing
   because of their larger mass. Despite the essentially isometric
   relationship found between digit length and body mass across prosimians,
   examination of the residual variation reveals that tarsiers and
   Daubentonia possess, relative to their body sizes, remarkably long
   fingers. Such marked departures between body size and finger length
   observed in these particular primates are closely linked with
   specialized modes of prey acquisition and manipulation involving the
   hands.},

Abstract = {Female dominance and feeding priority are considered unique behavioral
   strategies in many Malagasy lemuriformes, particularly Lemur catta. Two
   hypotheses have been introduced to explain these behavior patterns: 1)
   females are agonistically dominant over males to mitigate female-male
   food competition so that females can compensate for high energy demands
   and inefficient reproductive physiology, and 2) males defer to females
   when feeding as a reproductive strategy. We tested these hypotheses by
   conducting controlled feeding experiments on free-ranging ring-tailed
   lemurs (Lemur catta) on St. Catherine's Island, GA. Food was dispersed
   in three ways to simulate varying patch sizes. All feeding and agonistic
   interactions were recorded during each trial (n = 24). The degree of
   relatedness between individuals was determined using DNA fingerprinting.
   There was a clear relationship between food dispersion and both
   expression of female dominance and feeding priority. Elements of both
   hypotheses were supported because male and female L. catta used
   different strategies depending on rank and the dispersion of food.
   Interpretation of the impact of male rank was complicated because the
   younger, low-ranking males had female relatives in the group. Females
   fed more than males, and rates of aggression decreased as food
   dispersion increased. High-ranking, older unrelated males deferred to
   females and received little aggression. The top-ranking male deferred
   the most and sired most if not all of the offspring. Low-ranking,
   younger related males fought with females for access to food sources,
   received more aggression, and did not sire offspring.},

Abstract = {We extend the recently proposed graph-theoretical landscape perspective
   by applying some network-centric methods mainly developed in the social
   sciences. The methods we propose are suitable to (1) identify individual
   habitat patches that are disproportionally high in importance in
   preserving the ability of organisms to traverse the fragmented
   landscape, and (2) find internally well-connected compartments of
   habitat patches that contribute to a spatial compartmentalization of
   species populations. We demonstrate the utility of these methods using
   an agricultural landscape with scattered dry-forest patches in southern
   Madagascar, inhabited by the ring-tailed lemur, Lemur catta. We suggest
   that these methods are particularly suitable in landscapes where
   species' traversability is not fully inhibited by fragmentation, but
   merely limited. These methods are potentially highly relevant in
   studying spatial aspects of resilience and in the design of natural
   reserves.},

Abstract = {There are two possible approaches to understanding natural and
   human-induced changes in the primate communities of Madagascar. One is
   to begin with present-day and recent historic interactions and work
   backwards. A second is to begin with paleoecological records of Malagasy
   primate communities before and immediately following human arrival, and
   the associated evidence of human and nonhuman primate interactions, and
   work forwards. On the basis of biological and climatic studies, as well
   as historic and ethnohistoric records, we are beginning to understand
   the abiotic and biotic characteristics of Madagascar's habitats, the
   lemurs' ecological adaptations to these unique habitats, the extent of
   forest loss, fragmentation and hunting, and the differential
   vulnerability of extant lemur species to these pressures. On the basis
   of integrated paleoecological, archaeological and paleontological
   research, we have begun to construct a detailed chronology for late
   prehistoric Madagascar. We are beginning to understand the complex
   sequence of events that led to one of the most dramatic recent
   megafaunal extinction/extirpation events. Combining the perspectives of
   the past and the present, we see a complex set of interactions affecting
   an initially rich but vulnerable fauna. The total evidence refutes any
   simple, unicausal (e. g. hunting/habitat destruction/ climate change)
   explanation of megafaunal extinctions, yet unequivocally supports a
   major role - both direct and indirect - for humans as the trigger of the
   extinction process. It also supports a change over time in the relative
   importance of hunting versus habitat loss, and in the trophic
   characteristics of the primate communities in Madagascar. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {Aim We investigate the hypothesis that it was the capacity for torpor or
   hibernation that enabled the lemuriforms (and possibly other mammal
   groups, e.g. tenrecs and rodents) to invade Madagascar by means of
   over-water dispersal.
   Location Madagascar, East Africa and the Mozambique Channel.
   Methods We consider the body weights and life-style features of living
   primate taxa that employ heterothermy. Using this information as a
   standard for comparison, we summarize the available information on the
   Palaeogene strepsirrhine radiation (i.e. members of the infraorder
   Adapiformes, the extinct sister-taxon to the lemuriforms, as well as
   putative stem lemuriforms), particularly with respect to possible trends
   in body weight among early, middle and late Eocene adapiforms. We
   discuss Eocene climatic conditions in the northern hemisphere and
   Africa, and assess the likelihood of adaptations for heterothermy in
   adapiforms. Finally, we estimate the body weights of the common
   ancestors to the living Lemuriformes and Lemuroidea using the method of
   phylogenetically independent contrasts.
   Results The mean body weights estimated for the early, middle and late
   Eocene strepsirrhine faunas remain at approximately 2 kg, outside of the
   range of living primates using heterothermy. The adapiforms' appearance
   coincided with the `initial Eocene thermal maximum', an unusually hot
   period of global warming, and their demise corresponded with a major
   cooling event coincident with the appearance of ice sheets on
   Antarctica. They show no evidence of having evolved adaptations that
   allowed them to withstand climatic deterioration. The body weights of
   the ancestral lemuriform and ancestral lemuroid are of a similar order
   to the mean body weight estimated for the adapiforms, i.e. approximately
   1.8 and 2.1 kg, respectively.
   Main conclusions The available evidence argues against the widespread
   use of heterothermy by adapiforms. The adapiform-lemuriform divergence
   may have been the result of the lemuriforms adapting to the drier and
   more seasonal environments that characterized the African Eocene, and
   this suite of adaptations may have included the use of heterothermy, but
   there is as yet no substantial evidence to confirm the presence of
   either group on the continent prior to c. 40 Ma. The estimated body
   weights of the common lemuriform and lemuroid ancestors are well outside
   the size range of living mammals that employ heterothermy. We conclude
   that the hypothesis that it was the ability to use heterothermy that
   enabled the strepsirrhines, and not the haplorhines, to invade
   Madagascar, is unlikely. Alternative explanations for this anomaly
   should be sought.},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) occur in western Madagascar from
   the evergreen littoral rain forests at the southern tip of the island to
   the seasonal dry deciduous forests of the west and northwest. The wide
   geographic distribution allows researchers to investigate whether
   ecogeographic variations reflect adaptations to ambient temperatures, as
   a proxy for constraints of thermoregulation, or to rainfall, as a proxy
   of food availability. We compared body mass, number of litters/yr, and
   longevity for 3 populations: 1 from the evergreen littoral rain forest
   of the south (Mandena: annual mean temperature 23 degrees C, 1600 mm
   rain/yr), 1 from the dry deciduous forest of the west (Kirindy/CFPF: 25
   degrees C, 800 mm), and 1 from the dry deciduous forest of northwestern
   Madagascar (Ampijoroa: 27 degrees C, 1200 mm). Body mass decreases with
   increasing ambient temperature from south to north (Mandena >
   Kirindy/CFPF > Ampijoroa). The number of litters/yr was highest in the
   littoral rain forest (2 or 3 litters/yr) and decreased with decreasing
   rainfall (Mandena > Ampijoroa > Kirindy/CFPF). Life expectancy is lowest
   in the littoral forest (13\% recaptures of mouse lemurs between years)
   and high (ca. 30-40\% recaptures between years) in the dry forests
   (Mandena < Kirindy/CFPF and Ampijoroa). We postulate that constraints of
   thermoregulation result in the latitudinal gradient of body mass.
   Reduced resource productivity or seasonality is reflected in differences
   in reproductive rates, which seemed to be traded off against longevity.
   Thus body mass, longevity, and reproductive parameters respond
   differently to ambient conditions.},

Title = {Conservation biology of Malagasy strepsirhines: A phylogenetic approach},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {130},
Number = {2},
Pages = {238-253},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The phylogenetic diversity of extant lemurs represents one of the most
   important but least studied aspects of the conservation biology of
   primates. The phylogenetic diversity of a species is inversely
   proportional to the relative number and closeness of its phylogenetic
   relatives. Phylogenetic diversity can then be used to determine
   conservation priorities for specific biogeographic regions. Although
   Malagasy strepsirhines represent the highest phylogenetic diversity
   among primates at the global level, there are few phylogenetic data on
   species-specific and regional conservation plans for lemurs in
   Madagascar. Therefore, in this paper the following questions are
   addressed for extant lemurs: 1) how does the measure of taxonomic
   uniqueness used by Mittermeier et al. U9921 Lemurs of Madagascar; Gland,
   Switzerland: IUCN) equate with an index of phylogenetic diversity, 2)
   what are the regional conservation priorities based on analyses of
   phylogenetic diversity in extant lemurs, and 3) what conservation
   recommendations can be made based on analyses of phylogenetic diversity
   in lemurs? Taxonomic endemicity standardized weight (TESW) indices of
   phylogenetic diversity were used to determine the evolutionary component
   of biodiversity and to prioritize regions for conserving lemur taxa.
   TESW refers to the standardization of phylogenetic diversity indices for
   widespread taxa and endemicity of species. The phylogenetic data came
   from recent genetic studies of Malagasy strepsirhines at the species
   level. Lemur species were assigned as being either present or absent in
   six biogeographic regions. TESW indices were combined with data on lemur
   complementarity and protected areas to assign conservation priorities at
   the regional level. Although there were no overall differences between
   taxonomic ranks and phylogenetic rankings, there were significant
   differences for the top-ranked taxa. The phylogenetic component of lemur
   diversity is greatest for Daubentonia madagascariensis, Allocebus
   trichotis, Lepilemur septentrionalis, Indri indri, and Mirza coquereli.
   Regional conservation priorities are highest for lemurs that range into
   northeast humid forests and western dry forests. Expansion of existing
   protected areas in these regions may provide the most rapid method for
   preserving lemurs. In the long term, new protected areas must be created
   because there are lemur species that: 1) are not found in existing
   protected areas, 2) exist only in one or two protected areas, and 3) are
   still being discovered outside the current network of protected areas.
   Data on the population dynamics and feeding ecology of phylogenetically
   important species are needed to ensure that protected areas adequately
   conserve lemur populations in Madagascar.},

Title = {High-resolution X-ray computed tomography scanning of primate copulatory
   plugs},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {129},
Number = {4},
Pages = {567-576},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this study, high-resolution computed tomography X-ray scanning was
   used to scan ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) copulatory plugs. This
   method produced accurate measures of plug volume and surface area, but
   was not useful for visualizing plug internal structure. Copulatory plug
   size was of interest because it may relate to male fertilization
   success. Copulatory plugs form from coagulated ejaculate, and are
   routinely displaced in this species by the penis of a subsequent mate
   during copulation (Parga {[}2003] Int. J. Primatol. 24:889-899). Because
   one potential function of these plugs may be to preclude or delay other
   males' successful insemination of females, we tested the hypothesis that
   larger plugs are more difficult for subsequent males to displace. Plugs
   were collected opportunistically upon displacement during data
   collection on L. catta mating behavior on St. Catherines Island, Georgia
   (USA) during two subsequent breeding seasons. Copulatory plugs exhibited
   a wide range of volumes: 1,758-5,013.6 mm(3) (n = 9). Intraindividual
   differences in plug volume were sometimes greater than interindividual
   differences. Contrary to predictions, larger plugs were not more
   time-consuming for males to displace via penile intromission during
   copulation. Nor were plugs with longer vaginal residence times notably
   smaller than plugs with shorter residence times, as might be expected if
   plugs disintegrate while releasing sperm (Asdell {[}1946] Patterns of
   Mammalian Reproduction; Ithaca: Comstock). We found a significant
   inverse correlation between number of copulatory mounts leading to
   ejaculation and copulatory plug volume. This may indicate that if males
   are sufficiently sexually aroused to reach ejaculation in fewer mounts,
   they tend to produce ejaculates of greater volume.},

Abstract = {Age-associated dementia, in particular Alzheimer's disease (AD), will be
   a major concern of the 21st century. Research into normal brain aging
   and AD will therefore become increasingly important. As for other areas
   of medicine, the availability of good animal models will be a limiting
   factor for progress. Given the complexity of the human brain, the
   identification of appropriate primate models will be essential to
   further knowledge of the disease. In this review, we describe the
   features of brain aging and age-associated neurodegeneration in a small
   lemurian primate, the Microcebus murinus, also referred to as the mouse
   lemur. The mouse lemur has a relatively short life expectancy, and
   animals over 5 years of age are considered to be elderly. Among elderly
   mouse lemurs, the majority show normal brain aging, whereas
   approximately 20\% develop neurodegeneration. This Microcebus
   age-associated neurodegeneration is characterized by a massive brain
   atrophy, abundant amyloid plaques, a cytoskeletal Tau pathology and a
   loss of cholinergic neurons. While elderly mouse lemurs with normal
   brain aging maintain memory function and social interaction, animals
   with age-associated neurodegeneration lose their cognitive and social
   capacities and demonstrate certain similarities with age-associated
   human AD. We conclude that M. murinus is an interesting primate model
   for the study of normal brain aging and the biochemical dysfunctions
   occurring in age-associated neurodegeneration. Mouse lemurs might also
   become an increasingly important model for the development of novel
   treatments in this domain.},

Abstract = {Behavioral and neurophysiological studies strongly suggest that visual
   orienting reflects the integration of sensory, motor, and motivational
   variables. Relatively little is known, however, regarding the goals that
   govern visual orienting of animals in their natural environments. Field
   observations suggest that most nonhuman primates orient to features of
   their natural environments whose salience is dictated by the visual
   demands of foraging, locomotion, and social interaction. This hypothesis
   is difficult to test quantitatively, however, in part because accurate
   gaze-tracking technology has not been employed in field studies. We here
   report the implementation of a new, telemetric. infrared-video
   gaze-tracker to measure visual orienting in freely moving, socially
   housed prosimian primates (Lemur catta). Two male lemurs tolerated the
   system at approximately 1/4 body weight, permitting successful
   measurements of gaze behavior during spontaneous locomotion through both
   terrestrial and arboreal landscapes, and in both social and asocial
   environments. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Non-primate mammalian activity cycles are highly variable across and
   within taxonomic groups. In contrast, the order Primates has
   historically been recognized as displaying a diurnal-nocturnal dichotomy
   that mapped, for the most part, onto the taxonomic division between
   haplorhines and strepsirhines. However, it has become clear over the
   past two decades that activity cycles in primates are not quite so clear
   cut. Some primate species - like many large herbivorous mammals,
   mustelids, microtine rodents, and shrews - exhibit activity both at
   night and during the day. This activity pattern is often polyphasic or
   ultradian ( several short activity bouts per 24-hour period), in
   contrast to the generally monophasic pattern ( one long bout of activity
   per 24-hour period) observed in diurnal and nocturnal mammals.
   Alternatively, it can vary on a seasonal basis, with nocturnal activity
   exhibited during one season, and diurnal activity during the other
   season. The term now generally employed to describe the exploitation of
   both diurnal and nocturnal phases in primates is `cathemeral'.
   Cathemerality has been documented in one haplorhine, the owl monkey,
   Aotus azarai, in the Paraguayan and Argentinian Chaco and in several
   Malagasy strepsirhines, including Eulemur spp., Hapalemur sp. and Lemur
   catta. In this paper, we review patterns of day-night activity in
   primates and other mammals and investigate the potential ecological and
   physiological bases underlying such 24-hour activity. Secondly, we will
   consider the role of cathemerality in primate evolution. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {The role environmental factors play in influencing circadian rhythms in
   natural habitats is still poorly described in primates, especially for
   those taxa with an activity cycle extended over the 24-hour cycle. In
   this paper, we elucidate the importance of abiotic factors in entraining
   the activity of cathemeral primates, focussing on results from a
   long-term study of Eulemur fulvus collaris ( collared brown lemur) in
   south-eastern Malagasy littoral forest. Two groups of lemurs were
   followed for 60 whole-day and 59 whole-night observation periods over 14
   months. Diurnal and nocturnal observations were equally distributed
   among moon phases and seasons. Temperature and humidity were recorded
   hourly by automatic data loggers. The littoral forest has a climatic
   environment where rainfall and humidity are uncorrelated with
   temperature and photoperiod. Diurnal and nocturnal activity varied
   seasonally, with the former increasing significantly with extended day
   length and the latter increasing significantly with shortened day
   length. Dusk seemed to act as a primary zeitgeber for these lemurs,
   coordinating the onset of evening activity throughout the entire year.
   Lunar phase and the nocturnal luminosity index correlated positively
   with the duration of nocturnal activity and negatively with the length
   of diurnal activity. Temperature was positively associated with diurnal
   activity but did not seem to influence lemur rhythms at night. Finally,
   lemur nocturnal activity significantly decreased when levels of humidity
   and rainfall were high. Cathemeral biorhythm is triggered by zeitgebers
   and influenced by masking factors. The activity of collared brown lemurs
   appears to be seasonally influenced by photoperiod and directly
   modulated by nocturnal ambient luminosity. These results are discussed
   by comparing data from other cathemeral species living in various
   climatic situations. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

Abstract = {Cathemeral activity, in which the animals' motor activity is almost
   evenly distributed throughout the dark and the light portion of the day,
   has been described in various lemur genera (Eulemur, Hapalemur) and in
   the owl monkey Aotus azarai of the Argentinean Chaco. Proximate and
   ultimate factors responsible for this behaviour are still being debated.
   However, the chronobiological background of the behaviour has largely
   been ignored. We studied E. fulvus albifrons and A. a. boliviensis under
   controlled laboratory conditions to assess whether their activity rhythm
   is endogenously regulated by a circadian timing system that obeys
   general rules found in other mammals, or whether there are
   characteristic differences. To this end, we carried out long-term
   activity recordings on individuals of both subspecies kept under
   constant light and various light-dark cycles (LDs) using a PC-controlled
   electro-acoustic device in combination with telemetric body temperature
   measurements. Both subspecies developed free-running circadian activity
   and body temperature rhythms with periods deviating from 24 h in
   constant light, and LDs turned out to be the most efficient Zeitgeber
   synchronizing this endogenous rhythmicity to the external 24-hour day.
   The luminosity prevailing during the dark time of the LD had a decisive
   effect on levels of activity in the lemurs and induced strong masking
   effects on their circadian activity pattern. The results indicate that,
   from a chronobiological viewpoint, both species should be considered as
   dark active primates. Their diel activity rhythm is regulated by a
   normally responding circadian timing system and strong activity
   inhibiting or enhancing direct effects of light intensity. Thus,
   hypotheses on proximate and/or ultimate factors of cathemerality in
   primates must also consider its circadian background. Copyright (c) 2006

Abstract = {During a field study in 1974 it was noticed, and further fieldwork in
   1977 and 1980 confirmed, that the activity of the Mayotte lemur, Eulemur
   fulvus fulvus, is distributed fairly evenly throughout the daily 24-hour
   cycle: by a very crude approximation the daytime activity: rest ratio
   averages 0.271, while the night-time ratio averages 0.283. In 1978 I
   proposed the new word `cathemeral', compounded from the Greek roots
   kappa alpha tau alpha (through) and eta mu epsilon rho alpha (the day),
   to describe this unusual activity pattern, though for reasons described
   in this article the term was not formally published until 1988. Since
   then cathemeral activity has been routinely recorded, with some
   variation, in species of the strepsirhine genera Eulemur and Hapalemur;
   and in one form or another it apparently also occurs, at least
   occasionally, among platyrrhines (species of Aotus and Alouatta) as well
   as among a variety of non-primate mammals. It may well thus be a more
   widespread activity pattern than earlier appreciated. Copyright (c) 2006

Abstract = {Previous research on subfossil lemurs has revealed much about the
   positional behavior of these extinct strepsirrhines, but a thorough
   quantitative analysis of their vertebral form and function has not been
   performed. In this study, 156 lumbar vertebrae of Pachylemur,
   Archaeolemur, Megaladapis, Mesopropithecus, Babakotia, and
   Palaeopropithecus (11 species in all) were compared to those of 26
   species of extant strepsirrhines and haplorhines. Lumbar shape was
   compared among species, using a principal components analysis (PCA) in
   conjunction with selected vertebral indices. The first principal
   component revealed strong separation between Palaeopropithecus at one
   extreme, and Archaeolemurl Pachylemur at the other, with Babakotia,
   Mesopropithecus, and Megaladapis in an intermediate position.
   Palaeopropithecus has markedly shorter spinous processes and wider
   laminae than do the other subfossil taxa, consistent with sloth-like,
   inverted suspensory postures. The moderately reduced lumbar spinous
   processes of Babakotia, Mesopropithecus, and Megaladapis are convergent
   with those of lorisids and Pongo, reflecting antipronogrady, but a less
   specialized adaptation than that of Palaeopropithecus. Archaeolemur and
   Pachylemur share relatively elongated spinous processes, in conjunction
   with other features (e.g., transverse process orientation and relatively
   short vertebral bodies) indicative of pronograde, quadrupedal locomotion
   characterized by reduced agility. All subfossil taxa exhibit adaptations
   emphasizing lumbar spinal stability (e.g., relatively short vertebral
   bodies, and transverse processes that are not oriented ventrally); we
   believe this probably reflects convergent mechanical demands connected
   to large body size, irrespective of specific locomotor mode.
   Reconstructions of positional behavior in subfossil lemurs based on
   lumbar vertebrae are largely consistent with those based on other
   aspects of the postcrania.},

Abstract = {Recent expeditions to Madagascar have recovered abundant skeletal
   remains of Archaeolemur, one of the so-called ``monkey lemurs{''} known
   from Holocene deposits scattered across the island. These new skeletons
   are sufficiently complete to permit reassembly of entire hands and
   feet-postcranial elements crucial to drawing inferences about substrate
   preferences and positional behavior. Univariate and multivariate
   analysis of intrinsic hand and foot proportions, phalangeal indices,
   relative pollex and hallux lengths, phalangeal curvature, and distal
   phalangeal shape reveal a highly derived and unique morphology for an
   extinct strepsirrhine that diverges dramatically from that of living
   lemurs and converges in some respects on that of Old World monkeys
   (e.g., mandrills, but not baboons or geladas). The hands and feet of
   Archaeolemur are relatively short (extremely so relative to body size);
   the carpus and tarsus are both ``long{''} relative to total hand and
   foot lengths, respectively; phalangeal indices of both the hands and
   feet are low; both pollex and hallux are reduced; the apical tufts of
   the distal phalanges are very broad; and the proximal phalanges are
   slightly curved (but more so than in baboons). Overall grasping
   capabilities may have been compromised to some extent, and dexterous
   handling of small objects seems improbable. Deliberate and noncursorial
   quadrupedalism was most likely practiced on both the ground and in the
   trees. A flexible locomotor repertoire in conjunction with a eurytopic
   trophic adaptation allowed Archaeolemur to inhabit much of Madagascar
   and may explain why it was one of the latest surviving subfossil lemurs.

Abstract = {We present a summary of a long-term field study that examined the
   effects of forest disturbance on the availability of palatable fruit and
   its utilization by V. variegata. Forest structure and tree species
   composition were measured in three adjacent study areas, with different
   histories of disturbance, in Ranomafana National Park (RNP), Madagascar.
   V. variegata abundance was monitored by frequent encounters with
   resident groups and periodic censuses conducted along trails. Finally,
   the abundance of mature fruit in species used by V. variegata was scored
   monthly at representative trees at several locations. V. variegata
   abundance was most consistent in the least anthropogenically disturbed
   site, while no established lemur groups were observed in the heavily
   logged site for over a decade post-harvest. Lemur abundance was variable
   in the selectively logged site. The presence of select food trees,
   particularly specimens with voluminous crowns capable of producing
   abundant fruit crops, appears to be key to the establishment and
   expansion of V variegata groups. Our analysis of year-long fruit
   utilization revealed a high degree of preference for several species of
   trees. Two species exhibited mature fruit in a low percentage of stems
   but were available for a protracted period of time, while two additional
   species showed high intraspecific fruiting synchrony and were available
   for a shorter period of time. These contrasting phenologies, rather than
   the individual tree species, may be most important to V. variegata due
   to their coincident timing of fruit maturation with key lemur
   life-history events. Any disturbance-natural or anthropogenic-that
   disrupts the phenology cycles of food trees has the potential to impact
   lemur abundance and dispersion. Intense disturbances, such as heavy
   logging or severe cyclones, have long-lasting impacts on fruit
   production, while selective logging or moderate cyclonic windthrow cause
   more transient impacts. V. variegata is adapted to deal with an
   intrinsically erratic food supply by virtue of its reproductive biology
   and social behavior. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The infraorder Lemuriformes is characterized by a high level of
   homoplasy that clouds the evolutionary signal. The analysis of the
   morphological disparity of the Malagasy primates' crania and mandibles
   demonstrates the high determinism of functional specializations and
   developmental constraints, regardless of the phylogeny. In the present
   work, the weight of functional constraints linked to diet - a putative
   source of homoplasy - is analyzed first at the level of the infraorder
   Lemuriformes as a whole, and secondly at the level of a single family,
   the Cheirogaleidae, chosen because it contains taxa with two different
   diets (omnivory and gummivory). Malagasy primates are characterized by a
   great variety of dietary habits: some of them are omnivores, folivores,
   frugivores, guminivores, insectivores or even specialized hard-object
   feeders. All cheirogaleids feed on tree exudates, but while gum
   consumption is occasional or limited for Microcebus, Cheirogaleus and
   Mirza, gums are the dominant food source for Phaner and Allocebus.
   Craniofacial shape variations are analyzed using geometric
   morphometrics: methods based on landmark identification (Procrustes
   superimpositions) are chosen for cranium shape analysis, and methods
   based on outline decomposition (elliptical Fourier functions) for study
   of mandible shape. The morphospaces obtained at the level of the
   infraorder appear to be highly constrained by dietary habits, especially
   in the case of the mandibles. At the finer level of the family
   Cheirogaleidae, the analyses permit (1) separation of craniomandibular
   shape variation associated with the two dietary categories and (2) among
   the omnivorous category, to distinguish variation associated with the
   percentage of gum consumption.},

Title = {First experimental evidence for female mate choice in a nocturnal

Year = {2004},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {271-274},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Female mate choice can be hypothesised in most nocturnal primates, since
   females show a higher investment in their offspring than males. The aim
   of this experimental study was to investigate if female grey mouse
   lemurs perform mate choice and whether age, relatedness (to the male),
   or male advertisement call activity systematically influence their
   decisions. two-way mate choice design was developed in which females
   could choose between two males. Mate choice was deduced from the time
   spent in proximity to the males and from mating behaviour. During
   oestrus 12 of 17 females participated actively in the experiment and all
   of them showed either a significant spatial (n = 11) or behavioural (n =
   1) preference for one male. In four cases copulations were observed. The
   influence of age on female mate choice was not statistically
   significant. In the cases with copulations, however, females mostly
   preferred the older male. This might indicate a preference for older age
   as an indicator of experience, fitness, and/or status. The influence of
   relatedness on female mate choice could not be definitely clarified.
   However, results imply a mechanism of kin recognition on the basis of
   familiarity. In the majority of choices, females preferred the male with
   higher trill call activity. Since trill call activity correlates with
   the relative dominance status of males, these results suggest an
   importance of the male dominance status for female mate choice in grey
   mouse lemurs. Altogether our findings indicate that females use a
   complex of different cues to choose their mates.},

Abstract = {Captive data show that juvenile mammals usually reproduce the diet of
   the adult. However, it is not known whether, in natural environments,
   the process of feeding maturation varies according to available foods
   and to adult choices. I examined the feeding ontogeny of Mayotte brown
   lemurs (Eulemur fulvus), a presumed introduced species, from birth to 12
   mo old in the southern dry forest of Mayotte. The study focused on
   activities and diets of 4 mothers and their juveniles from 2 groups in
   1999 and 2000. In 2001, we also observed 2 other dyads from each group
   for 2 mo (March/April). I assessed plant phenology in each group's home
   range. There are 4 phases of feeding ontogeny: ( 1) the 3 mo following
   birth are characterized by lactation, early bouts of exploration, and
   consumption; ( 2) the next 2 mo are characterized by feeding and social
   weaning; ( 3) during the sixth and seventh mo, the daily feeding
   activity rhythms of the mother and her juvenile are synchronized and
   diets largely overlap; ( 4) at 10 - 12 mo of age, the feeding juvenile
   is closer to other group members than to its mother. During their first
   year of life, especially before being weaned, juveniles eat several food
   items that are not ingested by their mothers. It appeared that the
   progressive overlap in dietary items and feeding synchrony between
   mother and juvenile depends on several types of leaming. There is a
   correlation between the availability of particular food resources with
   high nutritional quality and timing of reproduction and infant
   maturation.},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {We examined the effects of age and time of day on balance performance in
   the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) in relation to body
   temperature variations. Groups of young, adult and aged animals were
   entrained to either short (SP, L/D 10/14) or long photoperiod (LP, L/D
   14/10) and tested in the accelerating Rotarod at three phases of their
   light/dark cycle (beginning and end of the light phase, beginning of the
   dark phase). In addition, for each test, rectal temperature (Tr) was
   measured. Under LP, whatever the test phase, this primate showed a clear
   age-related decrease in balance performance. Under SP, no significant
   age-related decline in balance could be detected. Whatever the
   photoperiod, an effect of time of day on balance performance could only
   be seen in adults, with better performances at the beginning of the dark
   phase when Tr values were higher. Under LP, daily variations of both
   balance performance and Tr disappeared with advancing age. Consequently,
   age differences were substantially greater when testing was conducted
   during the dark phase of the light/dark cycle. The time of day effect on
   balance performance and the loss of daily variations with age suggest
   the influence of age-related changes within the biological clock. (C)

Abstract = {Via a non-invasive approach, we aimed to provide comparative data on the
   presence and relative abundance of progestogen and estrogen metabolites
   excreted into the urine of Eulemur rubriventer, E. macaco flavifrons and
   Hapalemur griseus occidentalis and to characterize the patterns of
   progestogen and estrogen excretion during pregnancy. We found that
   estrone is the major urinary estrogen in Eulemur macaco flavifrons and
   Hapalemur griseus occidentalis, while 16alpha-hydroxyestrone appeared to
   be the predominant estrogen in the urine of E. rubriventer.
   Estradiol-17beta was either absent ( Hapalemur) or present in very low
   amounts. HPLC of progestogens had high levels of immunoreactivity in an
   assay against 5alpha-pregnane-3alpha-ol-20-one (5-P-3OH) in each
   species, though the nature of the progestogens measured by the 5-P-3OH
   assay differed among species. During pregnancy, 5-P-3OH levels remained
   relatively low in Eulemur rubriventer, whereas in E. macaco flavifrons
   and Hapalemur griseus occidentalis, a sustained elevation in levels
   occurred from mid-pregnancy until the final weeks before parturition.
   Estrogen excretion differed depending on the sex of the fetus in each
   species, with only females carrying male infants showing clearly
   elevated estrogen levels during the last 6 8 weeks of gestation. In
   conclusion, we demonstrate both species similarities and differences in
   the metabolism and urinary excretion patterns of reproductive hormones
   throughout gestation in the Lemuridae. The data not only extend our
   knowledge on the reproductive physiology of lemurs but also show that
   more studies on other lemur taxa are needed to provide a broader basis
   for interspecific comparison.},

Abstract = {We aimed to identify the geographical and biotic limitations of
   Microcebus berthae, the smallest extant primate. Furthermore we analyzed
   the mating system of two local populations and their habitat use in
   relation to microhabitat structures and to those of Microcebus murinus
   and Cheirogaleus medius, two potentially competing lemur species. The
   range of Microcebus berthae is restricted to less than or equal to 220
   km(2) in the dry deciduous forest of western Madagascar. A very
   optimistic estimate of the total population size is ca. 7900
   individuals. During a 13-mo mark-recapture study individuals were
   trapped from May 1995 to May 1996 at permanent trap locations 50 m apart
   over 2 study areas of ca. 25 ha each. The spacing of trap locations
   where individuals have been retrapped indicate that males have larger
   home ranges than those of females, which in concert with multiple intra-
   and intersexual range overlap indicates a promiscuous mating system. In
   contrast to the other 2 species, Microcebus berthae maintained specific
   habitat utilization patterns at 2 sites with different vegetation
   structures. Their habitat use in relation to vegetation characteristics
   differed from that of Cheirogaleus medius but not from that of
   Microcebus murinus. Co-occurrence patterns of Microcebus berthae and M.
   murinus deviated significantly from random and resembled a checkerboard
   distribution possibly generated by competitive exclusion. Thus,
   according to the niche concept, Microcebus berthae seem to be separated
   from Cheirogaleus medius by differences in food composition and habitat
   requirements, while they avoid direct competition with M. murinus by
   spatial separation.},

Abstract = {We experimentally tested the hypothesis that sexual dichromatism in the

   whose colors had been digitally altered to make him less and more
   colourful. Median viewing times of the pooled female Eulemur fulvus are
   significantly correlated with colorfulness. Viewing times in the control
   females are not correlated with color or brightness of the stimulus
   photographs. We concluded that the females of the Eulemur fulvus sspp.
   preferred to view photographs of more colorful males, which is
   consistent with the predictions of sexual selection theory.},

Abstract = {Many lemur species are characterized by some form of female dominance,
   ranging from female feeding priority to complete female dominance,
   although this is a rare trait in primates and other mammals. The status
   of the Milne-Edwards' sifaka (Propithecus diadema edwardsi), a diurnal
   lemur, is ambiguous. Some short-term studies have found little or no
   aggression. The aim of the current, long-term study was to quantify the
   intersexual-dominance patterns of this sifaka. The distribution,
   outcome, and context of aggressive interactions were studied in four
   groups of wild sifakas. The majority of intersexual aggressive
   interactions were decided, with the loser expressing submissive
   behavior. Intersexual aggressive interactions occurred in all social
   contexts, and within all social contexts the females won the vast
   majority (92.7-96.0\%) of aggressive interactions. While aggression
   rates were low (0.22/hr), this evidence suggests female dominance. We
   propose that female dominance exists because it provides a fitness
   advantage to both males and females. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Niche separation in Varecia variegata rubra and Eulemur fulvus
   albifrons: II. Intraspecific patterns},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {118},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Based on a year-long field study in northeastern Madagascar, I summarize
   annual patterns of niche use (food patch size, diet, forest height, and
   forest site) in two sympatric lemurs, Varecia variegata rubra and
   Eulemur fulvus albifrons. Furthermore, I examine intraspecific patterns
   of niche use according to sex, season, and reproductive stage in these
   two lemurs that differ in terms of energetic investment in reproduction.
   Lemurs as a group provide a special opportunity to test hypotheses
   concerning sex differences in niche use. Due to their body size
   monomorphism and seasonal, synchronous pattern of breeding, it is
   possible to directly evaluate whether sex differences in diet reflect
   high energetic investment in reproduction by females. Results confirm
   the hypothesis that intraspecific variation in niche use (e.g., sex
   differences, seasonal differences) would be more pronounced in V. v.
   rubra than in E. f. albifrons, due in large measure to the former's
   relatively high energetic investment in reproduction: 1a) Dietary sex
   differences in V. v. rubra are most pronounced during costly
   reproductive stages and involve acquisition of low-fiber, high-protein
   plant foods. Females of both species consume more seasonally available
   low-fiber protein (young leaves, flowers) relative to conspecific males
   during the hot dry season, but only in V. v. rubra females is this
   pattern also evident during gestation and lactation. 1b) The diets of
   female V. v. rubra and female E. f. albifrons are more similar to each
   other than are the diets of conspecific males and females in the case of
   V. v. rubra. This is not uniformly the case for female E. f. albifrons.
   This finding confirms a hypothesis put forward in Vasey ({[}2000] Am J
   Phys Anthropol 112:411-431) that energetic requirements of reproductive
   females drive niche separation more than do the energetic requirements
   of males. 1c) Both species synchronize most or all of lactation with
   seasonal food abundance and diversity. E. f. albifrons shows a more
   protracted period of synchrony, and this may contribute to its wide
   biogeographic distribution in Madagascar. 2) Sex differences and
   seasonal differences in microhabitat use reflect intraspecific patterns
   of thermoregulation, predator avoidance, and in the case of V. v. rubra,
   reproduction. One important factor selecting for body size monomorphism
   in lemurs appears to be the tight synchrony between lactation and
   periods of food abundance afforded by annual, seasonal breeding. (C)

Abstract = {Lemurs demonstrate various mating systems but paradoxically lack sexual

   examine how testicles vary relative to body weight within a population
   of Malagasy lemurs. We show that the significant positive relationship
   between body size and testicles in non-breeding seasons dissipates in
   breeding seasons because the testicles of lighter males grow more and
   match heavier males' testicles. Low and unpredictable plant productivity
   characterizes Madagascar's ecosystems, and natural selection may favour
   testicle-body size decoupling during challenging years, inhibiting the
   evolution of dimorphic males.},

Abstract = {Many mammals warn conspecifics with alarm calls about detected
   predators. These alarm calls are either functionally referential,
   urgency based, or they can have multiple functions, including predator
   deterrence. The taxonomic distribution of these alarm call systems is
   uneven, with primates providing the best-known examples for a
   functionally referential system and rodents most examples of an
   urgency-based system. Reports of different alarm call systems in lemurid
   primates prompted us to examine the anti-predator behavior of two
   additional lemur species, In an experimental field study we exposed
   adult redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus) and white sifakas
   (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) to playbacks of vocalizations of their
   main aerial and terrestrial predators, as well as to their own alarm
   calls given in response to the presentation of these predators. We
   scored the subjects' immediate behavioral responses, including alarm
   calls, from video recordings made during the first minute following a
   playback. We found that both species gave specific alarm calls only in
   response to raptor playbacks and the corresponding alarm calls, whereas
   calls given in response to carnivores and the corresponding alarm calls
   were also observed in other situations characterized by high arousal.
   Other behavioral responses, such as gaze and escape directions,
   corresponded to the hunting strategies of the two predator classes,
   suggesting that the corresponding vocalizations were categorized
   correctly. These two lemur species, which represent different families,
   have therefore independently evolved a mixed alarm call system,
   characterized by functionally referential calls for diurnal raptors, but
   not for carnivores.},

Abstract = {To study the temporal organization of daily hypothermia and torpor in a

   (T(b)) and locomotor activity were recorded using telemetry on 39 males
   held in 24-h light-dark cycles of different photoperiods. Under
   free-running condition, the circadian T(b) and locomotor activity
   rhythms had a period shorter than 24 h. Circadian daily hypothermia
   started by a rapid drop in T(b) (0.24 degreesC/10 min) at the end of
   subjective night (13 h 25 +/- 20 min) and was characterized by minimal
   T(b) values 3 h 20 +/- 5 min later. Spontaneous arousal from daily
   hypothermia occurred at a fixed time (6 h 05 +/- 15 min, n = 7) after
   the beginning of subjective day. In animals exposed to 24-h light-dark
   cycles with night duration varying from 10 to 14 h, locomotor activity
   was strictly restricted to dark time, but the temporal organization of
   daily hypothermia was not modified, although changes in amplitude of
   T(b) rhythm were observed. Daily hypothermia was directly induced by
   light and lasted 5 h 10 +/- 10 min, with minimal T(b) values 3 h 30 +/-
   30 min (n = 28) after lights on, on condition that nighttime did not
   exceed the duration of subjective night. However, in animals exposed to
   24-h light-dark cycles with night duration varying from 10 to 5 h, the
   limit of induction of daily hypothermia by light was similar to9 h after
   the beginning of night. Finally, under short days (14:10-h light-dark
   cycle), long bouts (6 h 50 +/- 40 min) of actual torpor (minimum T(b)
   27.6 +/- 0.9 degreesC) were observed and would involve mechanisms

Abstract = {Accurate estimates of mass and size are important in a wide range of
   research questions in population and evolutionary biology, and yet such
   data are still rare for wild primates. This study presents derailed
   longitudinal data from a large population of wild indriids, and
   demonstrates links between fluctuations in body mass, environmental
   cycles, and reproduction. Understanding these links is a necessary step
   toward explaining the function and evolution of distinctive features of
   lemur biology and behavior.
   During the first 12 years of an ongoing study of the sifaka, Propithecus
   verreauxi verreauxi, at Beta Mahafaly in southwest Madagascar, 320
   animals were captured and weighed throughout the year. Adult males and
   females exhibit seasonal cycles of mass loss, with females losing
   significantly more mass than males. In 2 drought years this pattern was
   especially pronounced. Compared to lighter females, females who were
   heavier at the time of the mating season were more likely to give birth
   in the following birth season. By showing (1) seasonally greater mass
   loss in reproductive females compared to males, particularly in drought
   years, (2) a close link between female mass and fertility, and (3) an
   uncoupling of the periods of highest body mass and of gestation and
   lactation, these results suggest that energy acquisition and storage are
   critically important in the life history strategies of female sifaka,
   and that ``capital breeding{''} may be a feature of sifaka reproductive
   strategies. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {The evolution and origin of primate social organisation has attracted
   the attention of many researchers, and a solitary pattern, believed to
   be present in most nocturnal prosimians, has been generally considered
   as the most primitive system. Nocturnal prosimians are in fact mostly
   seen alone during their nightly activities and therefore termed
   `solitary foragers', but that does not mean that they are not social.
   Moreover, designating their social organisation as `solitary', implies
   that their way of life is uniform in all species. It has, however,
   emerged over the last decades that all of them exhibit not only some
   kind of social network but also that those networks differ among
   species. There is a need to classify these social networks in the same
   manner. as with group-living (gregarious) animals if we wish to link up
   the different forms of primate social organisation with ecological,
   morphological or phylogenetic variables. In this review, we establish a
   basic classification based on spatial relations and sociality in order
   to describe and cope properly with the social organisation patterns of
   the different species of nocturnal prosimians and other mammals that do
   not forage in cohesive groups. In attempting to trace the ancestral
   pattern of primate social organisation the Malagasy mouse and dwarf
   lemurs and the Afro-Asian bushbabies and lorises are of special interest
   because they are thought to approach the ancestral conditions most
   closely. These species have generally been believed to exhibit a
   dispersed harem system as their pattern of social organisation
   ('dispersed' means that individuals forage solitarily but exhibit a
   social network). Therefore, the ancestral pattern of primate social
   organisation was inferred to be a dispersed harem. In fact, new field
   data on cheirogaleids combined with a review of patterns of social
   organisation in strepsirhines (lemurs, bushbabies and lorises) revealed
   that they exhibit either dispersed multi-male systems or dispersed
   monogamy rather than a dispersed harem system. Therefore, the concept of
   a dispersed harem system as the ancestral condition of primate social
   organisation can no longer be supported. In combination with data on
   social organisation patterns in `primitive' placentals and marsupials,
   and in monotremes, it is in fact most probable that promiscuity is the
   ancestral pattern for mammalian social organisation. Subsequently, a
   dispersed multi-male system derived from promiscuity should be regarded
   as the ancestral condition for primates. We further suggest that the
   gregarious patterns of social organisation in Aotus and Avahi, and the
   dispersed form in Tarsius evolved from the gregarious patterns of
   diurnal primates rather than from the dispersed nocturnal type. It is
   consequently proposed that, in addition to Aotus and Tarsius, Avahi is
   also secondarily nocturnal.},

Year = {1999},
Volume = {70},

Abstract = {Data presented here were collected during a 10-month study carried out
   on the mongoose lemur, Eulemur mongoz, at Anjamena in northwestern
   Madagascar. Baseline information is provided on behaviour and assessed
   for seasonal variation. Given the high ly seasonal nature of the
   environment, remarkably little behavioural variation was observed. This
   may be directly linked to the cathemeral activity pattern, where
   differential movement into either the diurnal or the nocturnal `niche'
   could reduce the effect of selective seasonal pressures, thus reducing
   behavioural and ecological adaptation to seasonal variation. The
   behavioural mechanisms of reinforcement of the pair bond through close
   proximity, mutual anogenital marking, paternal participation in the care
   of offspring and territoriality are all in accord with the general
   characteristics of monogamy in primates. The feature of mate
   monopolization by males, proposed as typical of monogamous social
   systems, seems to be more attributable to females in E. mongoz, as only
   they exhibit high levels of intrasexual aggression. Female dominance,
   characteristic of most species of lemur, may thus include more than just
   female feeding priority in E. mongoz.},

Abstract = {In the unique fauna assemblage of the Malagasy rain forest, lemurs
   appear to play particularly important roles as seed-dispersing
   frugivores. A three-month study of feeding ecology and seed dispersal by
   four species of lemurs in Madagascar's eastern rain forest found that
   three species, Eulemur rubriventer, Eulemur fulvus, and Varecia
   variegata were seed dispersers, and the fourth, Propithecus diadema, was
   a seed predator. In germination trials, seeds passed by lemurs sprouted
   significantly faster and in greater numbers than those not passed by
   lemurs. Analysis of fruit morphologies of 69 local plant taxa producing
   fleshy fruits during the study period found that these fruits fell into
   two well-defined color categories that correlated significantly with
   fruit size. Seventy seven percent of fleshy fruits greater than 10 mm in
   diameter were colored green, brown, tan, purplish, or black, while all
   fruits less than 10 mm in diameter were colored red, yellow, orange,
   pink, blue, or white. Three introduced exotic plant species provided
   exceptions to this pattern, producing fruits which were larger than 10
   mm and pink or orange. Fruits chosen by the primates in this study were
   usually larger than 10 mm in diameter and were in nearly all cases
   colored green, brown, tan, purplish, red, or some combination of these
   colors. Morphological traits shared by fruits of multiple plant taxa in
   the diets of seed-dispersing lemurs suggest possible coevolved
   relationships between Malagasy rain forest plants and lemurs.},

Volume = {135},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The main predators on large-bodied primates in rain forest are birds of
   prey and mammalian carnivores, which may require distinct strategies by
   prey for successful detection and defense. In the three dimensional rain
   forest environment with diminishing light at lower levels, downward
   visibility is difficult, and keen eyesight may not be as effective for
   detecting in-forest predators as soaring ones. It is therefore predicted
   that cryptic behaviours, where the problems of detection are shifted to
   the predator, may be used in these conditions. In Madagascar there is
   debate on whether extant eagles are a threat to the largest primate
   species, while there is mounting evidence that a mammalian carnivore,
   the fossa, impacts heavily on lemur populations. In a new approach to
   understanding the differential impact of raptor and carnivore hunting
   styles on lemur anti-predator behaviours, I analyzed ten years of
   behavioural data on Milne-Edwards' sifakas in the rain forest of
   Madagascar. I show that Propithecus diadema edwardsi responds to aerial
   predators by giving loud alarms calls with responsive avoidance
   behaviour, and by choosing daytime rest sites lower than feeding sites.
   In response to the mammal predator, Propithecus gave a distinct ground
   predator call, used higher nighttime sleep sites than daytime rest
   sites, and males were in most dangerous spatial positions during travel
   and feeding. The combination of protective travel order, high sleeping
   sites and small sleeping parties suggested behaviours against fossa
   predation. However, the dramatic `alarm call and drop low in the canopy'
   response to birds of prey is an indication that avian predators are
   feared.},

   activity was not markedly seasonal and apparently followed the phases of
   the moon. Increased nocturnal activity was noted when the moon was
   waxing and during the full moon. These nocturnal activity data are
   preliminary, as they were gathered by indirect methods. Nonetheless,
   these data strongly suggest that black lemurs do not exhibit a seasonal
   increase in cathemeral activity in association with the scarcity of
   fruit resources during the austral winter and a concomitant need to
   increase consumption of leaves, flowers or nectar.},

Abstract = {A well-known principle holds that where food supply is limited, two
   sympatric species with the same diet, morphology, and behavior will
   compete, leading to exclusion of one species or differentiation of their
   ecological niches. Avahi occidentalis and Lepilemur edwardsi are two
   saltatory, nocturnal folivorous lemurs of similar body size which live
   sympatrically over much of their range and may often be seen feeding in
   the same trees. We report a study of their locomotor behavior, carried
   out in order to determine to what extent locomotion might contribute to
   niche separation. Avahi lives at a higher level in the forest and is the
   more committed leaper, with a much larger home range and nightly travel
   distance, while Lepilemur climbs more and has a very small nightly
   travel distance. Avahi uses small, low-angled supports more often, while
   Lepilemur makes more use of large, high-angled supports (however,
   neither species uses vertical supports at a frequency greater than the
   availability of such supports in the forest stratum in which they Live).
   Both species tend to land on larger-diameter supports on longer leaps,
   but Avahi also takes off from larger-diameter supports in longer leaps,
   reducing loss of energy to the substrate during takeoff. We suggest that
   the differences in locomotion and ranging behavior between them are
   consistent with niche differentiation on the basis of food quality,
   Avahi investing more energy in harvesting better quality but more patchy
   food, Lepilemur minimizing expenditure in harvesting a less selective,
   quantitatively poorer diet. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Hadropithecus stenognathus (Lorenz von Liburnau {[}1899] Ant. Akad,

   reconstructed as primarily terrestrial and probably cursorial on the
   basis of its postcranial anatomy, especially long bone gracility and
   interlimb proportions. We show here that aspects of this reconstruction
   are almost certainly incorrect. Hindlimb bones of Archaeolemur have been
   misattributed to Hadropithecus, and new hindlimb allocations (including
   newly recognized elements such as the calcaneus) indicate that
   Hadropithecus had a robust body build and lacked osteological
   specializations for cursoriality. We review the evidence for the
   existence of `'Bradylemur'' and offer a view of archaeolemurid
   positional behavior that includes terrestrial and arboreal components.

Abstract = {We compared patterns of vigilance behavior in a male- and a
   female-dominant species-white-faced capuchins and ring-tailed lemurs-and
   used the results to test four hypotheses to explain vigilance behavior
   in primates. Adult male white-faced capuchins spent significantly more
   time vigilant than females did, and much male vigilance appeared to be
   directed toward males from other social groups. This finding supports
   the protection of paternity hypothesis. No sex difference existed in
   vigilance behavior among the ring-railed lemurs, and subjects of both
   sexes exhibited more vigilance toward predators/potential predators than
   toward extragroup conspecifics, which supports the predator detection
   hypothesis. A trade-off argument, suggesting that females tolerate males
   in a group in return for greater male vigilance, does not apply to
   ring-tailed lemurs in our study. In both the male-dominant capuchins and
   the female-dominant ring-tailed lemurs, the alpha subject in the
   majority of the study groups was significantly more vigilant than other
   group members were. In white-faced capuchins, the alpha male mates more
   often than subordinate males do; therefore, the greater degree of
   vigilance exhibited by the alpha male may correspond to the protection
   of his reproductive investment. In ring-tailed lemurs, there can be more
   than one matriline in a group. Thus, the greater amount of vigilance
   behavior exhibited by the alpha female may be related to protection of
   her matriline, which could ultimately lead to greater inclusive fitness.
   Alpha subjects in our study groups exhibited certain behaviors more
   frequently or exclusively. Accordingly, there may be a constellation of
   behaviors characteristic of alpha animals.},

Abstract = {Interlimb coordination is directly relevant to the understanding of the
   neural control of locomotion, but few studies addressing this topic for
   nonhuman primates are available, and no data exist for any hominoid
   other than humans. As a follow-up to Jungers and Anapol's ({[}1985] Am.
   J. Phys. Anthropol. 67:89-97) analysis on a lemur and talapoin monkey,
   we describe here the patterns of interlimb coordination in two
   chimpanzees as revealed by electromyography. Like the lemur and talapoin
   monkey, ipsilateral limb coupling in chimpanzees is characterized by
   variability about preferred modes within individual gaits. During
   symmetrical gaits, limb coupling patterns in the chimpanzee are also
   influenced by kinematic differences in hindlimb placement
   (''overstriding''). These observations reflect the neurological
   constraints placed on locomotion but also emphasize the overall
   flexibility of locomotor neural mechanisms. Interlimb coordination
   patterns are also species-specific, exhibiting significant differences
   among primate taxa and between primates and cats. Interspecific
   differences may be suggestive of phylogenetic divergence in the basic
   mechanisms for neural control of locomotion, but do not preclude
   morphological explanations for observed differences in interlimb
   coordination across species. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Occurrence of DNA sequence differences in C-heterochromatin of Eulemur
   coronatus and Eulemur macaco, as revealed by fluorescence resonance
   energy transfer},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HISTOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {79-90},
Abstract = {In the genus Eulemur (Malagasy lemurs) karyotype diversification has
   occurred mainly through Robertsonian mechanisms of chromosome fusion
   (Rumpler et al., 1976). Eulemur coronatus is the sole species to have
   the largest genome size, due to a very large amount of
   C-heterochromatin, mostly located at the pericentromeric regions of the
   largest chromosomes (Warter and Rumpler, 1985). This increase in
   C-heterochromatin was thought to be due to DNA amplification (Ronchetti
   et al., 1993). The aim of this work was to investigate whether the large
   C-heterochromatin of Eulemur coronatus might have derived by
   amplification of the smaller C-heterochromatin of Eulemur macaco, a
   closely related species with smaller genome size. To obtain information
   on the overall base composition of the total genomes, on the relative
   interspersion of AT and GC base pairs along the DNA molecule and on the
   structural differences in C-heterochromatin, we used a quantitative
   cytochemical approach, based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer
   (FRET) between DNA-specific fluorochromes (i.e. the AT-specific Hoechst
   33258, and the non base-specific dye, propidium iodide).
   Micro-spectrofluorometry and image analysis were used to investigate
   both the overall FRET efficiency and its spatial distribution along the
   chromosome arms. FRET efficiency values of the DNA in C-heterochromatin
   were significantly different in the two Eulemur species, indicating a
   different qualitative composition of repetitive DNA. This suggests that
   the repetitive DNA of Eulemur coronatus cannot have originated by
   amplification in tote of the repetitive DNA sequences of Eulemur macaco.},

Title = {Evidence for social enhancement of reproduction in two Eulemur species},
Journal = {ZOO BIOLOGY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-12},
Abstract = {Across the past 20 years, captive reproduction has declined steeply in
   mongoose lemurs (Eulemur mongoz) and has been only moderately successful
   in black lemurs (E. macaco). At the same time, reproduction has been so
   successful in brown lemurs (E. fulvus) that contraception has been used
   since 1987 to limit captive numbers. No obvious cause for the
   differential reproductive success has been identified. Our experience
   with a pair of unrelated mongoose lemurs at the Philadelphia Zoological
   Garden suggested that they reproduced in only those years when they were
   caged in close proximity to another nonreproductive, full-sibling pair
   of mongoose lemurs. Examination of the worldwide pattern of captive
   reproduction by Eulemur species during the past two decades revealed
   that female black and mongoose lemurs housed in institutions with either
   additional conspecific males or additional conspecific pairs had a
   higher rate of reproduction than those maintained as an isolated pair.
   Black lemurs also had higher rates of reproduction when additional
   conspecific females were present. No similar pattern was found for brown
   lemurs or for two comparable mammals, the pudu (Pudu pudu) and the okapi
   (Okapia johnstoni). The evidence presented for the black and mongoose
   lemurs supports the existence of the Allee effect in these two species,
   namely, that reproduction is enhanced by the presence of conspecifics.

Abstract = {We diagnose new subfossil specimens belonging to the extinct

   massif in northern Madagascar. They include three partial crania with
   mandibles, and the first vertebrae, ribs, clavicle, pelvis, ulna, and

   postcranial elements are known for this northern variant of
   Mesopropithecus and for previously described species from central and
   southern Madagascar. The new materials cannot be accommodated in either
   currently recognized species of this genus and are, hereby, given the
   name Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion. M. dolichobrachion is the second
   new species of extinct, subfossil lemur to be found in the caves of
   Ankarana. It is unlike the two previously described species of this
   genus primarily in its larger size, different limb proportions, and
   aspects of its long bone morphology. Most notable is the fact that this
   is the only species of Mesopropithecus with the forelimb longer than the
   hind limb-hence the name, the `'long-armed'' Mesopropithecus Various
   characteristics place M. dolichobrachion phenetically closest (of
   species belonging to Mesopropithecus) to Babakotia radofilai,
   Archaeoindris, and Palaeopropithecus. If these similarities are derived
   specializations rather than primitive for palaeopropithecids, a new

Abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships among various primate groups were examined
   based on sequences of epsilon-globin genes. epsilon-globin genes were
   sequenced from five species of strepsirhine primates. These sequences
   were aligned and compared with other known primate epsilon-globin
   sequences, including data from two additional strepsirhine species, one
   species of tarsier, 19 species of New World monkeys (representing all
   extant genera), and five species of catarrhines. In addition, a 2-kb
   segment upstream of the epsilon-globin gene was sequenced in two of the
   five strepsirhines examined. This upstream sequence was aligned with
   five other species of primates for which data are available in this
   segment. Domestic rabbit and goat were used as outgroups. This analysis
   supports the monophyly of order Primates but does not support the
   traditional prosimian grouping of tarsiers, lorisoids, and lemuroids;
   rather it supports the sister grouping of tarsiers and anthropoids into
   Haplorhini and the sister grouping of lorisoids and lemuroids into
   Strepsirhini. The mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) and dwarf lemur
   (Cheirogaleus medius) appear to be most closely related to each other,
   forming a clade with the lemuroids, and are probably not closely related
   to the lorisoids, as suggested by some morphological studies. Analysis
   of the epsilon-globin data supports the hypothesis that the aye-aye
   (Daubentonia madagascariensis) shares a sister-group relationship with
   other Malagasy strepsirhines (all being classified as lemuroids).
   Relationships among ceboids agree with findings from a previous
   epsilon-globin study in which fewer out group taxa were employed. Rates
   of molecular evolution were higher in lorisoids than in lemuroids.},

   in leaf selection by folivorous lemurs. The average quality of mature

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {57},
Number = {3},
Pages = {132-146},
Abstract = {Many primatologists believe that there is no sexual dimorphism in body
   size in prosimian primates. Because this belief is based upon data that
   came from only a few species and were largely flawed in some aspect of
   sample quality, I re-examined the extent of sexual dimorphism in body
   weight, using weights of 791 adult prosimians from 34 taxa recorded over
   the last 17 years at the Duke University Primate Center. There was no
   significant sex difference in body weight in 17 species, but males were
   significantly larger in Nycticebus pygmaeus, Tarsius syrichta, Galago
   moholi, Galagoides demidovii, Otolemur crassicaudatus and Otolemur
   garnettii. Moreover, females were significantly larger in Microcebus
   murinus. Thus, the general lack of sexual dimorphism could be confirmed,
   notably for lemurs, but prosimians as a group show more variability in
   sexual size dimorphism than was previously thought. After including
   previously published data obtained in the wild from 8 additional
   species, I found significant heterogeneity in the degree of sexual
   dimorphism at the family level, but only the Indridae and Galagidae were
   significantly different from each other. Among the prosimian
   infraorders, the Lorisiformes were significantly more dimorphic than the
   Lemuriformes. Differences in dimorphism between higher taxonomic groups
   are discussed in the context of prosimian evolution, concluding that
   phylogenetic inertia cannot provide a causal explanation for the
   evolution of sexual dimorphism. The relative monomorphism of most
   prosimians may be related to allometric constraints and, especially in

Title = {Seasonal changes in the parasite prevalence of a small Malagasy lemur
   species (Lepilemur edwardsi)},
Journal = {INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY},
Abstract = {Parasitic infections can impact the fitness of individuals and can have
   influence on animals' population dynamics. An individuals' parasite
   prevalence often changes depending on external or seasonal changes, for
   example, rainfall and ambient temperatures, but also on internal
   changes, for example, changes in body condition. In this study we aimed
   to identify the environmental factors that may influence the intestinal
   parasite and ectoparasite prevalence of the folivorous Malagasy primate
   species, Lepilemur edwardsi, living in a seasonal dry deciduous forest.
   Species living in this habitat have to adapt to seasonal changes of
   ambient temperature, with almost no precipitation during the dry season
   and hence strong fluctuations of resource availability throughout the
   year. We sampled the feces and ectoparasites of L. edwardsi throughout
   the year. Intestinal parasite prevalence increased from the wet to the
   dry season and was highest in the late dry season, which might be due to
   the accompanying decrease in diet quality. Conversely, ectoparasite
   prevalence decreased in the dry season, presumably due to the prevailing
   unfavorable environmental conditions for the development of
   ectoparasites (i.e., mites and ticks). Paired with the higher resting
   metabolism and stress level of L. edwardsi during the late dry season,
   it seems that this species may struggle when dry seasons intensify in
   its habitat.},

Title = {Substrate Diameter and Orientation in the Context of Food Type in the
   Gray Mouse Lemur, Microcebus murinus: Implications for the Origins of
   Grasping in Primates},

Abstract = {Grasping is a widespread behavior among tetrapod vertebrates. In
   primates, the hands and feet are involved in many tasks including
   arboreal locomotion and food acquisition. Yet, the origin and the
   evolution of prehensile capacities, which are highly diversified across
   this group, remain open for inquiry. Some researchers suggest that
   grasping evolved in an arboreal habitat consisting of fine branches
   associated with insect predation and/or fruit and flower exploitation.
   However, few studies have tested the importance of arboreal conditions
   and diet, e.g., frugivorous, omnivorous, on the use of the hands in food
   grasping. The aim of this study was to link substrate use and food
   grasping strategies quantitatively to test hypotheses concerning primate
   grasping origins. We studied a species often described as a good
   ecological model to study the origin of grasping in primates, Microcebus
   murinus, and quantified its spontaneous substrate use (diameter and
   orientation) in an unconstrained environment while presenting them with
   different food types (static and mobile). We show that 1) Microcebus
   murinus appears to be an opportunistic rather than a specialist user of
   fine branches as suggested previously, at least under laboratory
   conditions; and 2) food properties had an impact on the use of the hands
   vs. the mouth, with the hands being used more for the grasping of mobile
   prey. Our results are consistent with hypotheses for primate origins
   that propose adaptations to both a narrow branch environment and
   visually directed prey capture with the hands. However, additional
   studies in the wild are needed to understand better the origin and
   increased use of the hands in primates grasping and manipulation.},

Title = {Food acquisition on arboreal substrates by the grey mouse lemur:
   implication for primate grasping evolution},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},

Volume = {291},
Number = {4},
Pages = {235-242},

Abstract = {The use of the hand in food grasping is a shared characteristic of
   primates. However, the factors involved in the elaboration of this
   function remain unclear. Grasping hands may have evolved in an arboreal
   habitat with narrow branches. Interestingly, grasping may also have an
   association with different types of feeding such as insect predation,
   fruit and flower exploitation, or both. No study has tested the
   importance of substrate diameter and food properties on the use of the
   hand in food grasping. Yet, both of these parameters likely impose
   important selective pressures on the origin and evolution of manual
   grasping strategies in the context of food acquisition. Here, we
   quantified whether (1) substrate diameter (narrow, wide) and (2) food
   properties (static, slow moving, fast moving) influence food grasping in
   a small primate, Microcebus murinus. Our results show that narrow
   substrates increase the use of hands in prey grasping. The mouth is
   preferentially used to grasp static food (banana), whereas the hands are
   preferred to grasp moving prey (mealworm and cricket) regardless of the
   substrate. Thus, the narrow branch niche may be an important selective
   pressure on the emergence of manual food grasping in primates, but
   predation likely also played a key role.},

Title = {Group Size Predicts Social but Not Nonsocial Cognition in Lemurs},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 26},
Abstract = {The social intelligence hypothesis suggests that living in large social
   networks was the primary selective pressure for the evolution of complex
   cognition in primates. This hypothesis is supported by comparative
   studies demonstrating a positive relationship between social group size
   and relative brain size across primates. However, the relationship
   between brain size and cognition remains equivocal. Moreover, there have
   been no experimental studies directly testing the association between
   group size and cognition across primates. We tested the social
   intelligence hypothesis by comparing 6 primate species (total N = 96)
   characterized by different group sizes on two cognitive tasks. Here, we
   show that a species' typical social group size predicts performance on
   cognitive measures of social cognition, but not a nonsocial measure of
   inhibitory control. We also show that a species' mean brain size (in
   absolute or relative terms) does not predict performance on either task
   in these species. These data provide evidence for a relationship between
   group size and social cognition in primates, and reveal the potential
   for cognitive evolution without concomitant changes in brain size.
   Furthermore our results underscore the need for more empirical studies
   of animal cognition, which have the power to reveal species differences
   in cognition not detectable by proxy variables, such as brain size.},

Abstract = {Not only can teeth provide clues about diet, but they also can be
   indicators of habitat quality. Conspecific groups living in different
   habitats with different kinds of foods may exhibit different rates of
   dental attrition because their teeth are less well adapted to some foods
   than to others. Ecological disequilibrium describes the situation in
   which animals live in habitats to which they are relatively poorly
   adapted. We test whether dental senescence, the wear-related decrease in
   dental functionality that is associated with decreased survival of
   infants born to older Propithecus edwardsi females, can be explained by
   ecological disequilibrium. Specifically, we compare the rates of dental
   wear in sifaka groups living in nearby habitats that differ in the
   degree of anthropogenically induced disturbance. We hypothesize that
   sifakas living in disturbed areas have an unusual rate of tooth wear
   compared to those living in a more pristine area, and that dental
   senescence is a consequence of an atypically high wear rate in a
   degraded habitat. To test whether habitat quality affects tooth wear
   more generally, we compare rates of use-wear in two subsets of
   Microcebus rufus living in either relatively undisturbed or disturbed
   habitats. Contrary to our predictions, we did not detect different rates
   of tooth wear in disturbed versus undisturbed habitats for either
   species and consider that reproductively detrimental dental senescence
   in P. edwardsi females is unlikely to be a pathological consequence of
   ecological disequilibrium. Am J Phys Anthropol 148:228237, 2012. (c)

Abstract = {Molecular phylogeny is a fundamental tool to understanding the evolution
   of all life forms. One common issue faced by molecular phylogeny is the
   lack of sufficient molecular markers. Here, we present PhyloMarker, a
   phylogenomic tool designed to find nuclear gene markers for the
   inference of phylogeny through multiple genome comparison. Around 800
   candidate markers were identified by PhyloMarker through comparison of
   partial genomes of Microcebus and Otolemur. In experimental tests of 20
   randomly selected markers, nine markers were successfully amplified by
   PCR and directly sequenced in all 17 nominal Microcebus species.
   Phylogenetic analyses of the sequence data obtained for 17 taxa and nine
   markers confirmed the distinct lineage inferred from previous mtDNA
   data. PhyloMarker has also been used by other projects including the
   herons (Ardeidae, Aves) phylogeny and the Wood mice (Muridae, Mammalia)
   phylogeny. All source code and sample data are made available at

Abstract = {Dispersal is a critical issue for understanding various aspects of
   animal biology and for conserving endangered species. We investigated
   the conditions that determine dispersal in four groups of sifakas
   inhabiting Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. Following this
   population for 22 years, we collected and analyzed data on birth,
   relatedness, immigration, dispersal and death of 77 sifakas. We
   predicted that dispersal would function to prevent inbreeding and occur
   seasonally to aid establishment in a group before the breeding season.
   We further predicted that immigrants would evict same-sex residents and
   immigrant males would commit infanticide to shorten interbirth
   intervals. Although most dispersal theories predict male-biased
   dispersal in mammals, both male and female sifakas dispersed at equal
   rates from their natal and breeding groups. Behaviourally and
   genetically, there was no evidence for inbreeding within this
   population; individuals never produced offspring with close relatives.
   Dispersal matched the strong seasonal pattern of reproduction.
   Immigration events were always associated with the disappearance of the
   group infant(s). As a result of infanticide by male immigrants, mothers
   came into estrus sooner; infanticide by female immigrants caused mothers
   to disperse from their groups. This study reveals a clear pattern of
   dispersal that is condition, not sex, dependent.},

Abstract = {Sexual selection theory predicts that competitors or potential mates
   signal their quality or relatedness to conspecifics. Researchers have
   focused on visual or auditory modes of signal transmission; however, the
   importance of olfactory indicators is gaining recognition. Using a
   primate model and a new integrative analytical approach, we provide the
   first evidence relating male olfactory cues to individual genome-wide
   heterozygosity and to the genetic distance between individuals. The
   relationships between male semiochemical profiles and genetic
   characteristics are apparent only during the highly competitive and
   stressful breeding season. As heterozygosity accurately predicts health
   and survivorship in this population, we identify scrotal olfactory cues
   as honest indicators of male quality, with relevance possibly to both
   sexes. Beyond showing that semiochemicals could underlie kin recognition
   and nepotism, we provide a putative olfactory mechanism to guide
   male-male competition and female mate choice.},

Title = {Environmental and phylogenetic correlates of Eulemur behavior and

Abstract = {The extent of diversity within closely related taxa may be a function of
   their shared evolutionary history or of selective forces causing
   adaptive changes. Examining variation among taxa within a single genus
   may help to identify flexibility in trait variation because recently
   diverged populations are more likely living in the environment of
   adaptation. This study examines correlates of diversity in Eulemur, a
   genus that has a wide distribution in a variety of habitat types
   throughout Madagascar. Previously published data were gathered from 11
   long-term studies of Eulemur populations. Variables were categorized
   into multiple datasets: (1) environmental characteristics, (2) social
   organization, and (3) ecology, which included subsets for ranging
   behavior, diet, and activity budget. Molecular phylogenies from the
   literature were used to create the fourth and final dataset, a
   dissimilarity matrix of evolutionary distance among the 12 species and
   subspecies. Principal components and cluster analyses were implemented
   to examine the overall ecological similarity among Eulemur populations
   and to determine which variables contribute most to the variation among
   taxa. Partial Mantel tests were conducted to test for correlations among
   the dataset matrices. The results suggest ecological flexibility for the
   genus, in particular, populations in similar environments displayed
   similar activity patterns. In contrast, social organization showed no
   relationship with environment but was correlated with phylogenetic
   distance among populations. While Eulemur seems to demonstrate some
   flexibility for ecological adaptations, characteristics related to group
   size and sex ratio more closely track phylogeny and thus may be less
   flexible.},

Abstract = {Modern tools of paleoecological and ecomorphological research have
   enabled researchers to reconstruct the lifeways of extinct species more
   thoroughly than ever before. We apply a variety of tools in an attempt
   to reconstruct the diets of the extinct archaeolemurids of Madagascar.
   Our data include dental use wear (examined across species and across
   ontogenetic series of single species), enamel microstructure, enamel
   thickness, and delta C-13. The data are complemented by field data on
   the environmental contexts in which the species lived and C-14
   determinations that demonstrate the surprisingly late survival of
   archaeolemurids. Several lines of evidence converge to suggest that all
   archaeolemurid species were hard-object processors, but with different
   diets and different methods of food processing. Past reconstructions of
   the diet of Hadropithecus as a specialized grass consumer fail under the
   scrutiny of multiple lines of evidence.},

Title = {Food resource characteristics in two nocturnal lemurs with different

Year = {2001},
Volume = {22},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {I present results from a comparative field study on the feeding behavior
   of the gregarious Avahi occidentalis and the solitary-but-social
   Lepilemur edwardsi to evaluate hypotheses relating to social
   organization and food resources, While Avahi and Lepilemur are both
   nocturnal, have comparable body weights and positional behaviors, and
   are both folivorous, they differ in their social organization,
   Therefore, they present an ideal model for assessing food resource
   characteristics through comparisons of food selection in both species
   with regard to forest composition, The monogamous Avahi tend to select
   under-represented resources, They are repeatedly exploited, which
   suggests that their location must be known, It is worthwhile and
   probably imperative to defend those resources, Such defense imposes
   ranging limitations on male Avahi, Females may prefer familiar mates
   that will share their knowledge of resource location and defend the
   resources A stable monogamous pattern could be the optimal strategy. In
   contrast, food selection by Lepilemur is based on common resources to a
   higher degree, but they show a lower degree of exploitation, Lepilemur
   males would be less restricted and could potentially opt for a different
   strategy e,g,, a dispersed harem, It is unclear whether this strategy is
   realized or not, I discuss other possible correlates of
   monogamy-infanticide protection, predation avoidance-but the gregarious
   pattern in Avahi may best be seen as a retention. and its nocturnal
   activity as a secondary adaptation.},

Volume = {53},

Pages = {1-17},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The sifakas (Propithecus) include three species containing up to 10
   described subspecies, whose evolutionary relationships remain
   contentious. In particular, it is unclear whether P. verreauxi deckeni
   and P.v. coronatus populations are differentiated at the subspecific
   level. Furthermore, the taxonomic status of the recently discovered P.
   tattersalli and its phylogenetic position also require further
   examination. About 2,400 bp of mitochondrial DNA sequence data from part
   of the COIII gene, together with complete genes for ND3, ND4L, ND4, and
   five tRNAs, were used to clarify relationships among Propithecus species
   and subspecies. All analyses group Avahi as the sister group to all
   sifakas. P. diadema is placed as a sister group to all other
   Propithecus. Among the remaining sifakas, one subclade is formed by P.v.
   coquereli and P. tattersalli, while P.v. verreauxi, P.u. deckeni, and
   P.v. coronatus form the second subclade. All analyses fail to resolve
   P.u. coronatus and P.v, deckeni into separate monophyletic lineages.
   Based on pairwise distance comparisons and tree topology, we conclude
   that P. tattersalli does not represent a distinct species and that P.u.
   decheni and P. v. coronatus do not deserve subspecific rank. On the
   other hand, our analyses indicate that P.v. coquereli may well represent
   a separate species. Am. J. Primatol. 53:1-17, 2001. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss,

Title = {Madagascar Terrestrial Camera Survey Database 2021: A collation of
   protected forest camera surveys from 2007-2021},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {Madagascar is a threatened global biodiversity hotspot and conservation
   priority, yet we lack broad-scale surveys to assess biodiversity across
   space and time. To fill this gap, we collated camera trap surveys,
   capturing species occurrences within Madagascar into a single
   standardized database. This data set includes nine distinct protected
   areas of Madagascar and encompasses 13 subprojects, 38 camera arrays,
   and 1156 sampling units (independent camera site per survey) within two
   important biodiversity eco-regions: western dry deciduous forest and
   eastern humid rainforest. Camera surveys were conducted from June 2007
   to January 2021. The final data set includes 17 unique families of
   mammals (Bovidae, Canidae, Cheirogaleidae, Daubentoniidae, Equidae,
   Eupleridae, Felidae, Hominidae, Indriidae, Lemuridae, Lepilemuridae,
   Muridae, Nesomyidae, Pteropodidae, Soricidae, Suidae, Tenrecidae)
   comprising 45 species and 27 unique families of birds (Accipitridae,
   Acrocephalidae, Alcedinidae, Bernieridae, Brachypteraciidae,
   Caprimulgidae, Cisticolidae, Columbidae, Coraciidae, Corvidae,
   Cuculidae, Dicruridae, Mesitornithidae, Monarchidae, Motacillidae,
   Muscicapidae, Numididae, Phasianidae, Rallidae, Sarothruridae,
   Strigidae, Sturnidae, Sulidae, Threskiornithidae, Upupidae, Vangidae,
   Zosteropidae) comprising 58 species. Images were processed and verified
   by individual project data set creators and camera operation and species
   tables were then collated. The final product represents the first

Title = {Toxoplasmosis in Zoo Animals: A Retrospective Pathology Review of 126
   Cases},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Toxoplasma gondii is widespread amongst domestic animals
   and can affect humans. Whilst the disease is of economic importance and
   well-studied in ruminants, this is the first large-scale study
   evaluating toxoplasmosis in zoo animals. The aim of this study was to
   identify species that are particularly susceptible to disease, review
   clinical symptoms, organ distribution and key target tissues, highlight
   unusual outbreaks/presentations, assess predilections, evaluate
   toxoplasmosis as the cause of death and consider seasonality. A total of
   31 species were represented, with ring-tailed lemurs (RTLs), meerkats,
   Pallas' cats and squirrel monkeys most affected. An unusual outbreak
   occurred in Asian short-clawed otters. Non-specific, neurological,
   gastrointestinal, respiratory signs and sudden death dominated
   clinically, mainly in animals over 12 months of age that presented with
   systemic disease. Pallas' cats showed encephalitis (inflammation of the
   brain) and lymphoid tissue was frequently involved in RTLs. Lesions were
   primarily found in heart, liver, lungs, brain, spleen and lymph nodes.
   Cases occurred year-round, with species-specific peaks and increases
   between August and November. This study demonstrates that toxoplasmosis
   is a significant cause of disease in zoo animals. Knowledge of species
   susceptibility will aid the treatment of affected animals by zoo
   veterinarians. Due to the lifecycle of the parasite, feral cat/rodent
   control is crucial to reduce infection pressure and prevent disease.
   Toxoplasma gondii is an extremely successful zoonotic protozoan parasite
   that has been demonstrated in a wide range of endo- and poikilothermic
   species. Although infection is widespread amongst domestic animals,
   overt disease other than abortion in small ruminants is sporadic. This
   survey evaluates toxoplasmosis in zoo animals based on a systematic
   review of pathology archive material (n = 33,506 submissions) over a
   16-year study period. A total of 126 submissions, deriving from 32 zoos,
   two educational facilities and two private owners, were included in the
   study, based on gross lesions, cytological, histological and
   immunohistological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. Clinical history,
   signalment, annual distribution and post-mortem findings were evaluated.
   A total of 31 species (mammalian 97\%/avian 3\%) were represented in the
   study material. Ring-tailed lemurs, slender tailed meerkats, Pallas'
   cats, and squirrel monkeys were most affected. An unusual outbreak
   occurred in Asian small-clawed otters, in which toxoplasmosis has not
   been reported to date. Clinically, animals over 12 months of age
   presented with non-specific symptoms (anorexia, weight loss, lethargy,
   debilitation), neurological, gastrointestinal or respiratory signs and
   sudden death. Systemic disease predominated, with a propensity for
   encephalitis in meerkats and Pallas' cats and systemic disease involving
   lymphoid tissues in ring-tailed lemurs. Cases in the UK occurred
   year-round, with species-specific peaks and increases between August and
   November. This study reinforces the importance of toxoplasmosis as a
   significant cause of sporadic and epizootic mortalities in a wide range
   of zoo animals. Feral cat control is crucial to reduce infection
   pressure.},

Title = {Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering Microscopy: A Label-Free Method to
   Compare Spinal Cord Myelin in Different Species},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Many histological techniques are used to identify and characterize
   myelin in the mammalian nervous system. Due to the high content of
   lipids in myelin sheaths, coherent anti-stokes Raman scattering (CARS)
   microscopy is a label-free method that allows identifying myelin within
   tissues. CARS excites the CH2 vibrational mode at 2845 cm(-1) and CH2
   bonds are found in lipids. In this study, we have used CARS for a new
   biological application in the field of spinal cord analysis. We have
   indeed compared several parameters of spinal cord myelin sheath in three
   different species, i.e., mouse, lemur, and human using a label-free
   method. In all species, we analyzed the dorsal and the lateral funiculi
   of the adult thoracic spinal cord. We identified g-ratio differences
   between species. Indeed, in both funiculi, g-ratio was higher in mice
   than in the two primate species, and the myelin g-ratio in lemurs was
   higher than in humans. We also detected a difference in g-ratio between
   the dorsal and the lateral funiculi only in humans. Furthermore, species
   differences between axon and fiber diameters as well as myelin thickness
   were observed. These data may reflect species specificities of
   conduction velocity of myelin fibers. A comparison of data obtained by
   CARS imaging and fluoromyelin staining, a method that, similar to CARS,
   does not require resin embedding and dehydration, displays similar
   results. CARS is, therefore, a label-free alternative to other
   microscopy techniques to characterize myelin in healthy and neurological
   disorders affecting the spinal cord.},

Title = {RNA splicing programs define tissue compartments and cell types at

Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {The extent splicing is regulated at single-cell resolution has remained
   controversial due to both available data and methods to interpret it. We
   apply the SpliZ, a new statistical approach, to detect
   cell-type-specific splicing in >110K cells from 12 human tissues. Using
   10X Chromium data for discovery, 9.1\% of genes with computable SpliZ
   scores are cell-type-specifically spliced, including ubiquitously
   expressed genes MYL6 and RPS24. These results are validated with RNA
   FISH, single-cell PCR, and Smart-seq2. SpliZ analysis reveals 170 genes
   with regulated splicing during human spermatogenesis, including examples
   conserved in mouse and mouse lemur. The SpliZ allows model-based
   identification of subpopulations indistinguishable based on gene
   expression, illustrated by subpopulation-specific splicing of classical
   monocytes involving an ultraconserved exon in SAT1. Together, this
   analysis of differential splicing across multiple organs establishes
   that splicing is regulated cell-type-specifically.},

Abstract = {Background Nucleotide excision repair is the primary DNA repair
   mechanism that removes bulky DNA adducts such as UV-induced pyrimidine
   dimers. Correspondingly, genome-wide mapping of nucleotide excision
   repair with eXcision Repair sequencing (XR-seq), provides comprehensive
   profiling of DNA damage repair. A number of XR-seq experiments at a
   variety of conditions for different damage types revealed heterogenous
   repair in the human genome. Although human repair profiles were
   extensively studied, how repair maps vary between primates is yet to be
   investigated. Here, we characterized the genome-wide UV-induced damage
   repair in gray mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus, in comparison to human.
   Results We derived fibroblast cell lines from mouse lemur, exposed them
   to UV irradiation, and analyzed the repair events genome-wide using the
   XR-seq protocol. Mouse lemur repair profiles were analyzed in comparison
   to the equivalent human fibroblast datasets. We found that overall UV
   sensitivity, repair efficiency, and transcription-coupled repair levels
   differ between the two primates. Despite this, comparative analysis of
   human and mouse lemur fibroblasts revealed that genome-wide repair
   profiles of the homologous regions are highly correlated, and this
   correlation is stronger for highly expressed genes. With the inclusion
   of an additional XR-seq sample derived from another human cell line in
   the analysis, we found that fibroblasts of the two primates repair
   UV-induced DNA lesions in a more similar pattern than two distinct human
   cell lines do. Conclusion Our results suggest that mouse lemurs and
   humans, and possibly primates in general, share a homologous repair
   mechanism as well as genomic variance distribution, albeit with their
   variable repair efficiency. This result also emphasizes the deep
   homologies of individual tissue types across the eukaryotic phylogeny.},

Abstract = {In tropical Africa, wild meat consumption by rural communities who live
   in or near protected areas can be a major challenge in the conservation
   of threatened species. Lemurs and the fossa are among the species
   consumed in Makira Natural Park, Madagascar. Because of their low
   reproductive rates and the high human population density, these species
   are known to be hunted unsustainably. We estimated the prevalence of
   lemur and fossa meat consumption in villages within and around Makira
   Natural Park using an indirect questioning method, the unmatched count
   technique (UCT), and compared it with results from direct questioning.
   The UCT revealed that 53.0\% of households had eaten lemur meat over the
   previous year (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 42.0-64.1\%) and 24.2\%
   had eaten fossa meat (95\% CI: 14.2-34.2\%). The percentage of
   households that ate lemur meat estimated through the UCT was more than
   3.3 times higher than that obtained from direct questioning, and 12
   times higher for fossa. Our estimates will be used to define the scale
   needed for a behavior change campaign to be conducted in the study area
   and will serve as a baseline to assess the impact of conservation
   activities aimed at reducing the consumption of lemurs and fossas.},

Abstract = {Mammalian teeth have to sustain repetitive and high chewing loads
   without failure. Key to this capability is the periodontal ligament
   (PDL), a connective tissue containing a collagenous fibre network which
   connects the tooth roots to the alveolar bone socket and which allows
   the teeth to move when loaded. It has been suggested that rodent molars
   under load experience a screw-like downward motion but it remains
   unclear whether this movement also occurs in primates. Here we use
   synchroton micro-computed tomography paired with an axial loading setup
   to investigate the form-function relationship between tooth movement and
   the morphology of the PDL space in a non-human primate, the mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus). The loading behavior of both mandibular and
   maxillary molars showed a three-dimensional movement with translational
   and rotational components, which pushes the tooth into the alveolar
   socket. Moreover, we found a non-uniform PDL thickness distribution and
   a gradual increase in volumetric proportion of the periodontal
   vasculature from cervical to apical. Our results suggest that the PDL
   morphology may optimize the three-dimensional tooth movement to avoid
   high stresses under loading.},

Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Microglia activation plays vital roles in neuroinflammatory pathologys.
   Lemurs tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) was reported to regulate NF-kappa B
   signals. In the present study, the roles of LMTK2 were investigated in
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated BV-2 cells. Reverse
   transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR and western blotting (WB) were
   utilized to analyze LMTK2 levels in LPS-treated BV2 cells. MTT assay
   determined cell viabilities. Nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2
   (PGE2) levels were assessed through Griess and enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The expression level of
   inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were detected
   through RT-qPCR and WB. The release of inflammatory mediators under LPS
   stimulation, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta
   (IL-1 beta), IL-6 and IL-10, were analyzed through ELISA. WB was used to
   analyze the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme
   oxygenase 1 (HO-1)/NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1) signal
   pathway. The results showed that the levels of the inflammatory
   mediators, iNOS, NO, COX-2 and PGE2, along with pro-inflammatory
   factors, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6, were significantly decreased
   following the induction of exogenous LMTK2 expression by LMTK2
   overexpression plasmids in LPS-induced BV2 microglia. In contrast,
   anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 showed obvious decrease. Additionally,
   LMTK2 overexpression induced the elevation of Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and
   nucleus, along with the upregulation of HO-1 and NQO1 expression. In
   conclusion, LMTK2 is postulated to regulate neuroinflammation possibly
   through Nrf2 pathway. The present study is essential to reveal the
   underlying function of LMTK2 and to identify novel therapeutic targets
   for drug development in treating neuroinflammation.},

Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {The muscles of facial expression are of significant interest to studies
   of communicative behaviors. However, due to their small size and high
   integration with other facial tissues, the current literature is largely
   restricted to descriptions of the presence or absence of specific
   muscles. Using diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed
   tomography (DiceCT) to stain and digitally image the mimetic mask of
   Eulemur flavifrons (the blue-eyed black lemur), we demonstrate-for the
   first time-the ability to visualize these muscles in three-dimensional
   space and to measure their relative volumes. Comparing these data to
   earlier accounts of mimetic organization with the face of lemuroidea, we
   demonstrate several novel configurations within this taxon, particularly
   in the superior auriculolabialis and the posterior auricularis. We
   conclude that DiceCT facilitates the study these muscles in closer
   detail than has been previously possible, and offers significant
   potential for future studies of this anatomy.},

Abstract = {Yersinia enterocolitica (YE) bioserotype 1B/O:8 (YE 1B/O:8) was
   identified in routine culture of a variety of zoo species housed at
   Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium (OHDZA) from April to July 2011.
   Animal cases representing 12 species had YE detected from 34 cases
   during routine fecal monitoring and/or during postmortem examination:
   Coquerel's sifakas (Propithecus coquereli, two cases), black \& white
   (BW) ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata variegata, six cases), red ruffed
   lemurs (Varecia rubra, seven cases), white handed gibbon (Hylobates lar
   albimana, one case), black lemurs (Eulemur macaco, three cases),
   mongoose lemurs (Eulemur mongoz, two cases), African hunting dogs
   (Lycaon pictus, five cases), agile gibbons (Hylobates agilis, three
   cases), siamangs (Hylobates syndactylus, two cases), colobus monkey
   (Colobus angolensis palliates, one case), argus pheasant (Argusianus
   argus, one case), and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus, one case). Most species
   were not symptomatic; however, three symptomatic cases in Coquerel's
   sifakas (two) and a white handed gibbon (one) showed clinical signs of
   diarrhea and lethargy that resulted in death for the Coquerel's sifakas.
   One unexpected death also occurred in a BW ruffed lemur. To the authors'
   knowledge, this is the first report of YE 1B/O:8 in such a large variety
   of zoo species. The source of the YE could not be identified, prompting
   the initiation of a diseases surveillance program to prevent further
   cases for the species that are sensitive to YE. To date, no additional
   cases have been identified, thus suggesting a single introduction of the
   YE 1B/O:8 strain into the zoo environment.},

Abstract = {Hapalemur sps. and Prolemur simus (bamboo lemurs, collectively) stand
   out from the relatively homogeneous lemurids because they are bamboo
   feeders and vertical clingers and leapers. This unique diet presents
   equally unique challenges, like its verticality, toughness, and
   toxicity. The bamboo lemurs share the generalized anatomy of the other
   lemurids, but also display some well-documented skeletal adaptations,
   perhaps to overcome the problems presented by their specialization.
   Soft-tissue adaptations, however, remain largely unexplored. Explored
   here are possible soft-tissue adaptations in Hapalemur griseus. We
   compare H. griseus with other lemurids, Propithecus, Galago, Tarsier,
   and a tree shrew. Based on the available anatomical and physiological
   data, we hypothesize that Hapalemur and Prolemur species will have
   differences in hindlimb morphology when compared with other lemurids. We
   predict that H. griseus will have more hindlimb muscle mass and will
   amplify muscle mass differences with increased type II muscle fibers.
   Relative hindlimb muscle mass in H. griseus is less than other
   prosimians sampled, yet relative sural muscle mass is significantly
   heavier (P < 0.01) in H. griseus. Results show that the soleus muscle of
   H. griseus has a higher amount of type II (fast) fibers in
   plantarflexors. These findings indicate although H. griseus shares some
   generalized lemurid morphology, its diet of bamboo may have pushed this
   generalized lemurid to an anatomical extreme. We suspect additional
   bamboo-specific adaptations in their anatomy and physiology will be
   uncovered with further examination into the anatomy of the bamboo
   lemurs. Anat Rec, 2019. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Anat Rec,

Abstract = {Primates face many climate and land use change threats, making long-term
   population monitoring critical to prioritizing conservation efforts.
   Ground-based line transects are typically conducted to estimate and
   monitor primate populations. However, transects may be costly and
   logistically challenging. We sought to test whether low-cost (<5,000
   USD), ready-to-use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could effectively
   monitor primate populations in north-eastern Madagascar. Critically
   Endangered {[}A3cd] golden-crowned sifakas (Propithecus tattersalli) are
   medium-sized, white lemurs whose creamy colour contrasts against
   defoliated tree canopies, making them an ideal study species for aerial
   counts. Quad-copter UAV flights over sifaka groups did not elicit
   antipredator responses. Photographs demonstrated the ability of UAVs to
   capture viable imagery of sifakas from approximately 20 m above ground
   level. Unfortunately, crashes resulting from an inability to programme
   automated flights over hilly forests cut this pilot study short,
   highlighting several challenges that remain to implementing UAVs in
   remote field studies. This study demonstrates that while UAVs offer
   considerable promise in the future of primate research and conservation,
   high start-up costs and remote field conditions provide challenging
   obstacles to first time users hoping to use this exciting new
   technology. Furthermore, we strongly recommend that thermal cameras be
   used for direct primate counts with UAVs.},

Title = {Food Insecurity and the Unsustainable Hunting of Wildlife in a UNESCO
   World Heritage Site},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Madagascar faces dual challenges in biodiversity conservation and public
   health. In order to identify strategies to reduce the unsustainable
   hunting of threatened species while maintaining or improving child
   nutrition, we quantified interactions among ecosystem indicators (lemur
   density and habitat biodiversity indices), health indicators (stunting,
   underweight, wasting, and anemia), nutrition, food security, and
   wildlife hunting through interviews of 1,750 people in 387 households
   and surveys of 28 wildlife transects with 156 habitat plots at 15 sites
   on Madagascar's Masoala Peninsula, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The
   surveyed population ate 6,726 forest animals (mammals and birds), or a
   mean of 3.27 kg of wild meat per person (4.48 kg per adult equivalent)
   during the prior year. Local Malagasy were also highly food insecure
   (78\% of households) and malnourished (for children under five, as many
   as 67\% were stunted, 60\% were underweight, 25\% were wasted, and 40\%
   were anemic). In some communities, nearly 75\% of animal-sourced
   calories, 76\% of protein, and 74\% of iron came from forest
   animals-demonstrating a strong dependence on wild foods. Few
   micronutrient-rich alternatives to wild meats were available in adequate
   supply and many were highly volatile; for example, 79\% of chickens died
   from Newcastle disease in the prior year. The survivorship of lemurs
   (94\% of lemur species are threatened with extinction) depends on
   providing food security to a malnourished human population who commonly
   hunts wildlife for food. Currently, wildlife provides a critical source
   of micronutrients, yet the hunting of threatened species is an untenable
   solution to poor diet and food insecurity. Given the established
   connection between wild foods and human nutrition, reductions in forests
   and wildlife populations will also threaten the local food supply. In
   order to reduce the unsustainable hunting of threatened species while
   improving household food security and child health, we suggest testing
   the effects of increasing the affordability, accessibility, and
   stability of micro-nutrient rich animal-sourced foods in communities
   where forests contribute the most to food security.},

Abstract = {Hunting of wildlife is one of the major threats to biodiversity. For
   effective conservation programmes in countries where hunting and
   shifting agriculture are the main sources of subsistence, forest
   management should aim to reduce hunting pressure and forest
   exploitation. The presence of researchers has been promoted as one of
   the main ways to mitigate anthropogenic pressures on wildlife
   populations. Our aim was to test whether local management and the
   establishment of a research station had a role in decreasing forest
   exploitation by local people living adjacent to a recently protected
   area in south-east Madagascar. We interviewed local people from nine
   villages at various distances from the recently established research
   station of Ampasy, in the northernmost portion of the Tsitongambarika
   Protected Area, to explore how people use the forest, with a particular
   focus on hunting. We also performed transect surveys to estimate snare
   and lemur encounter rates before local forest management began, at the
   establishment of the research station, and 1 year after. The impact of
   local communities on the forest seems to have decreased since the
   beginning of forest management, with a further decrease since the
   establishment of the research station. Participants from villages not
   involved in the local management were more reluctant to declare their
   illegal activities. We conclude that a combination of local management
   and related activities (e.g. installation of a research station) can
   assist in temporarily reducing forest exploitation by local communities;
   however, community needs and conservation plans should be integrated to
   maintain long-term benefits.},

Abstract = {The sardine fishery in Bali is influenced by fishing effort and
   environmental conditions including temperature and chlorophyll a
   (chl-a). Bali's sardine, Sardinella lemuru Bleeker, production decreased
   significantly during the extreme conditions that occurred in 2010 and
   2016. This study assesses the impact of extreme conditions on the
   sardine fishery of the Bali Strait. Fisheries data were collected from
   two landing places: Muncar fishing port (Banyuwangi District, East Java
   Province) and Pengambengan fishing port (Jembrana District, Bali
   Province) between January 2007 and December 2017. Temperature and chl-a
   data were downloaded from satellite readings. Fishing locations were
   observed by an onboard observer to investigate shifts in fishing
   grounds. A modified Cobb-Douglas regression model and profile analyses
   were used to estimate the impact of environmental variables on sardine
   production and to assess how extreme periods affect the catch
   composition in the Bali Strait. Seawater temperature and chl-a
   concentration had significant impacts on sardine production, but
   temperature is likely to be less correlated with sardine production than
   chl-a concentration. To adapt to extreme weather, purse seiners prefer
   to modify the vessel type rather than change their fishing ground.},

Title = {Faecal glucocorticoid metabolite profiles in diademed sifakas increase

   and habitat degradation},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {We measured faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (GCs) in Critically
   Endangered diademed sifaka to understand how food availability,
   nutritional intake and habitat disturbance impact stress physiology. GCs
   elevated with food scarcity and correlated negatively with feeding time.
   Attenuated GCs in fragmented forest groups suggest a downregulated
   response to a chronically poor environment.
   Abstract Glucocorticoids are metabolic byproducts of animals'
   physiological responses to ecological or social challenges and are
   thought to represent an adaptive response allowing beneficial responses
   to short-term challenges. Glucocorticoid metabolites (GCs) can be
   assayed non-invasively through faeces and therefore can be a useful tool
   to gauge the health of populations experiencing natural and/or
   anthropogenic stressors. However, the response of GCs to anthropogenic
   stressors varies, with both higher and lower GC levels reported. Here,
   we describe variation in GC secretion within eight diademed sifaka
   (Propithecus diadema) groups across 1 year. These groups span a gradient
   of anthropogenic habitat disturbance, including groups in continuous
   forest (CONT') and disturbed fragments (FRAG'), and indicators of health
   suggest that FRAG groups are negatively impacted by habitat disturbance.
   We monitored phenology, used focal animal follows to quantify diet and
   collected faeces (n = 547) from which we quantified GC content using
   enzyme immunoassay. All groups showed elevated lean-season GCs, but with
   a single, brief peak. GCs were inversely correlated with feeding time.
   No overall effect of habitat (CONT vs. FRAG) was found, but the
   lean-season peak was significantly higher in CONT groups. There was a
   significant season{*}age-sex interaction; adult females had an
   attenuated lean-season response compared with groupmates. The observed
   lean-season challenge' is consistent with previous lemur studies, as
   well as mammals in general. Low and largely invariable GC levels in
   FRAG, within the context of observed health and nutritional declines,
   suggest that FRAG groups employ a strategy whereby the adrenal response
   to stressors is downregulated. More research is needed to contextualize
   our observations of GC variation and health on an individual level, both
   in terms of corroborating evidence for ecological and social stressors,
   and longer-term quantification of reproductive success and fitness.},

Abstract = {Among the behavioral traits shared by some nonhuman primate species and
   humans there is singing. Unfortunately, our understanding of animals'
   rhythmic abilities is still in its infancy. Indris are the only lemurs
   who sing and live in monogamous pairs, usually forming a group with
   their offspring. All adult members of a group usually participate in
   choruses that are emitted regularly and play a role in advertising
   territorial occupancy and intergroup spacing. Males and females emit
   phrases that have similar frequency ranges but may differ in their
   temporal structure. We examined whether the individuals' contribution to
   the song may change according to chorus size, the total duration of the
   song or the duration of the individual contribution using the
   inter-onset intervals within a phrase and between phrases. We found that
   the rhythmic structure of indri's songs depends on factors that are
   different for males and females. We showed that females have
   significantly higher variation in the rhythm of their contribution to
   the song and that, changes according to chorus size. Our findings
   indicate that female indris sustain a higher cost of singing than males
   when the number of singers increases. These results suggest that
   cross-species investigations will be crucial to understanding the
   evolutionary frame in which such sexually dimorphic traits occurred.},

Title = {Evolution of Melanoma Antigen-A11 (MAGEA11) During Primate Phylogeny},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {Melanoma antigen-A11 (MAGE-A11) is an X-linked and primate-specific
   steroid hormone receptor transcriptional coregulator and proto-oncogenic
   protein whose increased expression promotes the growth of prostate
   cancer. The MAGEA11 gene is expressed at low levels in normal human
   testis, ovary, and endometrium, and at highest levels in
   castration-resistant prostate cancer. Annotated genome predictions
   throughout the surviving primate lineage show that MAGEA11 acquired
   three 5' coding exons unique within the MAGEA subfamily during the
   evolution of New World monkeys (NWM), Old World monkeys (OWM), and apes.
   MAGE-A11 in all primates has a conserved FXXIF coactivator-binding motif
   that suggests interaction with p160 coactivators contributed to its
   early evolution as a transcriptional coregulator. An ancestral form of
   MAGE-A11 in the more distantly related lemur has significant amino acid
   sequence identity with human MAGE-A11, but lacks coregulator activity
   based on the absence of the three 5' coding exons that include a nuclear
   localization signal (NLS). NWM MAGE-A11 has greater amino acid sequence
   identity than lemur to human MAGE-A11, but inframe premature stop codons
   suggest that MAGEA11 is a pseudogene in NWM. MAGE-A11 in OWM and apes
   has nearly identical 5' coding exon amino acid sequence and conserved
   interaction sites for p300 acetyltransferase and cyclin A. We conclude
   that the evolution of MAGEA11 within the lineage leading to OWM and apes
   resulted in steroid hormone receptor transcriptional coregulator
   activity through the acquisition of three 5' coding exons that include a
   NLS sequence and nonsynonymous substitutions required to interact with
   cell cycle regulatory proteins and transcription factors.},

Abstract = {Sympatric species are known to host the same parasites species.
   Nevertheless, surveys examining parasite assemblages in sympatric
   species are rare. To understand how parasite assemblages in sympatric
   host species differ in a given locality, we used a noninvasive
   identification method based on high-throughput sequencing. We collected
   fecal samples from sympatric species in Ranomafana National Park,
   Madagascar, from September to December in 2010, 2011, and 2012 and
   identified their parasites by metabarcoding, sequencing a region of the
   small ribosomal subunit (18S) gene. Our survey included 11 host species,
   including endemic primates, rodents, frogs, gastropods, and nonendemic
   rats and dogs. We collected 872 samples, of which 571 contained
   nematodes and 249 were successfully sequenced. We identified nine
   putative species of parasites, although their correspondence to actual
   parasite species is not clear as the resolution of the marker gene
   differs between nematode clades. For the host species that we
   successfully sampled with 10 or more positive occurrences of nematodes,
   i.e., mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus), black rats (Rattus rattus), and
   frogs (Anura), the parasite assemblage compositions differed
   significantly among host species, sampling sites, and sampling years.
   Our metabarcoding method shows promise in interrogating parasite
   assemblages in sympatric host species and our results emphasize the
   importance of choosing marker regions for parasite identification
   accuracy.},

Title = {Taste responsiveness to two steviol glycosides in three species of
   nonhuman primates},
Journal = {CURRENT ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63-68},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Primates have been found to differ widely in their taste perception and
   studies suggest that a coevolution between plant species bearing a
   certain taste substance and primate species feeding on these plants may
   contribute to such between-species differences. Considering that only
   platyrrhine primates, but not catarrhine or prosimian primates, share an
   evolutionary history with the neotropical plant Stevia rebaudiana, we
   assessed whether members of these three primate taxa differ in their
   ability to perceive and/or in their sensitivity to its two
   quantitatively predominant sweettasting substances. We found that not
   only neotropical black-handed spider monkeys, but also paleotropical
   black-and-white ruffed lemurs and Western chimpanzees are clearly able
   to perceive stevioside and rebaudioside A. Using a two-bottle preference
   test of short duration, we found that Ateles geoffroyi preferred
   concentrations as low as 0.05mM stevioside and 0.01mM rebaudioside A
   over tap water. Taste preference thresholds of Pan troglodytes were
   similar to those of the spider monkeys, with 0.05mM for stevioside and
   0.03mM for rebaudioside A, whereas Varecia variegata was slightly less
   sensitive with a threshold value of 0.1mM for both substances. Thus, all
   three primate species are, similar to human subjects, clearly more
   sensitive to both steviol glycosides compared to sucrose. Only the
   spider monkeys displayed concentration-response curves with both
   stevioside and rebaudioside A which can best be described as an inverted
   U-shaped function suggesting that Ateles geoffroyi, similar to human
   subjects, may perceive a bitter side taste at higher concentrations of
   these substances. Taken together, the results of the present study do
   not support the notion that a co-evolution between plant and primate
   species may account for between-species differences in taste perception
   of steviol glycosides.},

Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {284},
Number = {1868},
Month = {DEC 6},
Abstract = {In wild primates, social behaviour influences exposure to
   environmentally acquired and directly transmitted microorganisms. Prior
   studies indicate that gut microbiota reflect pairwise social
   interactions among chimpanzee and baboon hosts. Here, we demonstrate
   that higher-order social network structure-beyond just pairwise
   interactions-drives gut bacterial composition in wild lemurs, which live
   in smaller and more cohesive groups than previously studied anthropoid
   species. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and social network analysis of
   grooming contacts, we estimate the relative impacts of hierarchical
   (i.e. multilevel) social structure, individual demographic traits, diet,
   scent-marking, and habitat overlap on bacteria acquisition in a wild
   population of Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) consisting of
   seven social groups. We show that social group membership is clearly
   reflected in the microbiomes of individual sifaka, and that social
   groups with denser grooming networks have more homogeneous gut microbial
   compositions. Within social groups, adults, more gregarious individuals,
   and individuals that scent-mark frequently harbour the greatest
   microbial diversity. Thus, the community structure of wild lemurs
   governs symbiotic relationships by constraining transmission between
   hosts and partitioning environmental exposure to microorganisms. This
   social cultivation of mutualistic gut flora may be an evolutionary
   benefit of tight-knit group living.},

Abstract = {Understanding factors that influence local community support for
   conservation projects is critical to their success. Perceptions of
   wildlife are particularly important in countries where people rely
   heavily on natural resources for their survival, as is the case in
   Madagascar. Renowned as one of the ``hottest{''} regions for global
   biodiversity, Madagascar hosts an exceptional assemblage of lemurs. Yet
   little is known concerning the knowledge and perceptions of local people
   toward lemurs. The Lake Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) is
   classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List and restricted
   to marsh habitat in the Lake Alaotra New Protected Area. Habitat
   destruction and hunting have brought the lemur to the brink of
   extinction. In this study we characterize local people's knowledge,
   awareness, and perceptions of Hapalemur alaotrensis. We conducted an
   initial survey with 180 participants in 6 villages with varying distance
   to Park Bandro, a high-priority conservation zone. During a second
   survey, we interviewed 50 people in the village adjacent to the park.
   Our findings demonstrate that fishers are the most knowledgeable local
   resource users despite having the lowest education levels, and they also
   are the most concerned with the endemic lemur's decline. There is a link
   between environmental awareness and distance in both a literal and
   figurative sense; the more often people encounter Hapalemur alaotrensis,
   the more they know about it, and the more likely they are to be
   concerned about its future. Our study further shows that despite this
   concern, subsistence is prioritized over conservation in the Alaotra
   region. Ecological knowledge in the fishers' communities is a valuable
   resource that can benefit the conservation of Hapalemur alaotrensis and
   its marshland habitat if conservation planning and management can align
   the resource users' concerns and livelihood needs with biodiversity
   values.},

Abstract = {Lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3) is a member of the serine/threonine
   tyrosine kinase family, which is thought to be involved in tumor
   progression and prognosis. The purpose of the present study was to
   determine the diagnostic significance and therapeutic targets in thyroid
   cancer. ELISA assay was used to detect the protein expression of serum
   LMTK3. Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction were employed to measure the expression of
   LMTK3. Flow cytometry was used to determine the cell cycle. Transwell
   assay was used to measure the invasion and migration of SW579 cells and
   terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
   assay to detect cell apoptosis. The LMTK3 level was positively
   associated with disease stage and pathological type, whereas there was
   no correlation between LMTK3 level and gender, age, tumor size or lymph
   node metastasis. The serum LMTK3 level was significantly increased in
   102 thyroid carcinoma patients compared with 52 benign thyroid tumor
   patients and 50 healthy volunteers (P= 0.001). The protein and mRNA
   expression of LMTK3 was markedly higher in thyroid cancer patients
   compared with patients with benign thyroid tumors. Notably, LMTK3
   knockdown retarded proliferation, invasion and migration in SW579 cells.
   In addition, downregulation of LMTK3 promoted apoptosis in SW579 cells.
   These findings indicated that LMTK3 knockdown retards the growth of
   thyroid cancer cells partly through inhibiting proliferation, invasion,
   migration and inducing apoptosis in SW579 cells. It may serve as a
   useful diagnostic biomarker and a novel therapeutic target for patients
   with thyroid cancer.},

Abstract = {Hibernation is a complex physiological response that some mammalian
   species employ to evade energetic demands. Previous work in mammalian
   hibernators suggests that hibernation is activated not by a set of genes
   unique to hibernators, but by differential expression of genes that are
   present in all mammals. This question of universal genetic mechanisms
   requires further investigation and can only be tested through additional
   investigations of phylogenetically dispersed species. To explore this
   question, we use RNA-Seq to investigate gene expression dynamics as they
   relate to the varying physiological states experienced throughout the
   year in a group of primate hibernators-Madagascar's dwarf lemurs (genus
   Cheirogaleus). In a novel experimental approach, we use longitudinal
   sampling of biological tissues as a method for capturing gene expression
   profiles from the same individuals throughout their annual hibernation
   cycle. We identify 90 candidate genes that have variable expression
   patterns when comparing two active states (Active 1 and Active 2) with a
   torpor state. These include genes that are involved in metabolic
   pathways, feeding behavior, and circadian rhythms, as might be expected
   to correlate with seasonal physiological state changes. The identified
   genes appear to be critical for maintaining the health of an animal that
   undergoes prolonged periods of metabolic depression concurrent with the
   hibernation phenotype. By focusing on these differentially expressed
   genes in dwarf lemurs, we compare gene expression patterns in previously
   studied mammalian hibernators. Additionally, by employing evolutionary
   rate analysis, we find that hibernation-related genes do not evolve
   under positive selection in hibernating species relative to
   nonhibernators.},

Title = {The Indris Have Got Rhythm! Timing and Pitch Variation of a Primate Song
   Examined between Sexes and Age Classes},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {A crucial, common feature of speech and music is that they show
   non-random structures over time. It is an open question which of the
   other species share rhythmic abilities with humans, but in most cases
   the lack of knowledge about their behavioral displays prevents further
   studies. Indris are the only lemurs who sing. They produce loud howling
   cries that can be heard at several kilometers, in which all members of a
   group usually sing. We tested whether overlapping and turn-taking during
   the songs followed a precise pattern by analysing the temporal structure
   of the individuals' contribution to the song. We found that both
   dominants (males and females) and non-dominants influenced the onset
   timing one another. We have found that the dominant male and the
   dominant female in a group overlapped each other more frequently than
   they did with the non-dominants. We then focused on the temporal and
   frequency structure of particular phrases occurring during the song. Our
   results show that males and females have dimorphic inter-onset intervals
   during the phrases. Moreover, median frequencies of the unit emitted in
   the phrases also differ between the sexes, with males showing higher
   frequencies when compared to females. We have not found an effect of age
   on the temporal and spectral structure of the phrases. These results
   indicate that singing in indris has a high behavioral flexibility and
   varies according to social and individual factors. The flexible spectral
   structure of the phrases given during the song may underlie perceptual
   abilities that are relatively unknown in other non-human primates, such
   as the ability to recognize particular pitch patterns.},

Title = {Dead or alive? Viability of chytrid zoospores shed from live amphibian

Journal = {DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {119},

Abstract = {Pathogens vary in virulence and rates of transmission because of many
   differences in the host, the pathogen, and their environment. The
   amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), affects
   amphibian hosts differently, causing extinction and population declines
   in some species but having limited effects on others. Phenotypic
   differences in zoospore production rates among Bd lineages likely
   contribute to some of the variation observed among host responses,
   although no studies have quantified the viability of zoospores shed from
   live animals. We compared host survivorship, infection intensity,
   shedding rates, and zoospore viability between 2 species of endangered
   tropical frogs, Hylomantis lemur and Atelopus zeteki, when exposed to a
   highly virulent lineage of Bd (JEL 423). We applied a dye to zoospores
   30 to 60 min following animal soaks, to estimate shedding rate and
   proportion of live zoospores shed by different species. The average
   infection intensity for A. zeteki was nearly 17 times higher (31 455 +/-
   10 103 zoospore genomic equivalents {[}ZGEs]) than that of H. lemur
   (1832 +/- 1086 ZGEs), and A. zeteki died earlier than H. lemur. The
   proportion of viable zoospores was similar to 80\% in both species
   throughout the experiment, although A. zeteki produced many more
   zoospores, suggesting it may play a disproportionate role in spreading
   disease in communities where it occurs, because the large number of
   viable zoospores they produce might increase infection in other species
   where they are reintroduced.},

Abstract = {This study presents the most complete generic phylogenetic framework to
   date for the tribe Coleeae (Bignoniaceae), which is endemic to
   Madagascar and the other smaller islands in the western part of the
   Indian Ocean. The study is based on plastid and nuclear DNA regions and
   includes 47 species representing the five currently recognized genera
   (including all the species occurring in the western Indian Ocean
   region). Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses supported (i) the
   monophyly of the tribe, (ii) the monophyly of Phylloctenium,
   Phyllarthron and Rhodocolea and (iii) the paraphyly of Colea due to the
   inclusion of species of Ophiocolea. The latter genus was also recovered
   paraphyletic due to the inclusion of two species of Colea (C. decora and
   C. labatii). The taxonomic implications of the mutual paraphyly of these
   two genera are discussed in light of morphological evidence, and it is
   concluded that the two genera should be merged, and the necessary new
   nomenclatural combinations are provided. The phylogenetic framework
   shows Phylloctenium, which is endemic to Madagascar and restricted to
   dry ecosystems, as basal and sister to the rest of the tribe, suggesting
   Madagascar to be the centre of origin of this Glade. The remaining
   genera are diversified mostly in humid ecosystems, with evidence of
   multiple dispersals to the neighboring islands, including at least two
   to the Comoros, one to Mauritius and one to the Seychelles. Finally, we
   hypothesize that the ecological success of this tribe might have been
   triggered by a shift of fruit-dispersal mode from wind to lemur. (C)

Title = {Agroecosystems and primate conservation: Shade coffee as potential
   habitat for the conservation of Andean night monkeys in the northern
   Andes},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {215},
Pages = {57-67},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The global change in land use toward agroecosystems is one of the major
   drivers of habitat loss and fragmentation. Although simplified
   agroecosystems such as pastures generally exclude most native
   biodiversity, other more complex systems such as agroforestry can
   support certain levels of biodiversity and serve as habitat, connecting
   corridors or stepping stones for many species. For example, traditional
   shade coffee plantations can become key refuge areas for biodiversity,
   especially compared to more intensive agricultural practices.
   The principal aim of this study was to evaluate the potential role of
   shade coffee plantations on the conservation of Andean night monkeys
   (Aotus lemurinus) in the Colombian highlands. Two groups of night
   monkeys were followed during 16 and 7 months, and data on their ranging
   patterns, habitat use, activity budget and diet were recorded using
   focal animal sampling. We also estimated habitat wide fruit availability
   at natural forests and shade coffee. Overall, both study groups
   preferred natural forests relative to their spatial cover, spending
   703\% and 94.4\% of their time in natural forests, even though shade
   coffee had a yearly 10-fold total productivity advantage over natural
   habitats (4045 and 416 kg/h/year, respectively). Nonetheless, night
   monkeys used shade coffee areas throughout the year, specially during
   the peak periods of fruit production of Prunus integrifolia (43\% of
   time during June-July 2009; 64\% of time during March 2010), a tree that
   dominated the shade coffee areas. The activity budget, home range size
   and nightly travelled distances of Andean night monkeys in this study
   fall within the range of values reported in previous studies on night
   monkeys on disturbed and undisturbed habitats. The results of this study
   provide support for the use of shade coffee plantations as complementary
   areas for the conservation of Andean primate populations while providing
   local farmers with economic alternatives. Although the conservation of
   montane primate populations in Colombia will largely depend on the
   protection of the remaining natural habitats, agroecosystems such as
   shade coffee plantations might provide additive opportunities to
   increase the carrying capacity of mixed habitats and may become a
   successful conservation strategy in the pervasively transformed habitats
   of the northern Andes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Molecular systematics and undescribed diversity of Madagascan
   scolecophidian snakes (Squamata: Serpentes)},
Journal = {ZOOTAXA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {4040},
Number = {1},

Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {We provide an updated molecular phylogenetic analysis of global
   diversity of typhlopid and xenotyphlopid blindsnakes, adding a set of
   Madagascan samples and sequences of an additional mitochondrial gene to
   an existing supermatrix of nuclear and mitochondrial gene segments. Our
   data suggest monophyly of Madagascan typhlopids, exclusive of introduced
   Indotyphlops braminus. The Madagascar-endemic typhlopid clade includes
   two species previously assigned to the genus Lemuriatyphlops (in the
   subfamily Asiatyphlopinae), which were not each others closest
   relatives. This contradicts a previous study that described
   Lemuriatyphlops based on a sequence of the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1
   gene from a single species and found this species not forming a clade
   with the other Malagasy species included. Based on our novel
   phylogenetic assessment we include all species in this endemic typhlopid
   clade in the genus Madatyphlops and in the subfamily Madatyphlopinae and
   consider Lemuriatyphlops as junior synonym. Within Madatyphlops, we
   identify several candidate species. For some of these (those in the M.
   arenarius complex), our preliminary data suggest sympatric occurrence
   and morphological differentiation, thus the existence of undescribed
   species. We also comment on the genus-level classification of several
   non-Madagascan typhlopids. We suggest that African species included in
   Madatyphlops (Afrotyphlops calabresii, A. cuneirostris, A.
   platyrhynchus, and Rhinotyphlops leucocephalus) should not be included
   in this genus. We furthermore argue that recent claims of Sundatyphlops,
   Antillotyphlops, and Cubatyphlops being ``undiagnosable{''} or ``not
   monophyletic{''} were based on errors in tree reconstruction and failure
   to notice diagnostic characters, and thus regard these three genera as
   valid.},

Title = {The Effects of Illegal Hunting and Habitat on Two Sympatric Endangered
   Primates},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {74-93},

Abstract = {Threats to primates result from the complex relationship between
   ecological processes and the direct and the indirect impacts of humans.
   Yet we know little about the proportional impacts of hunting and changes
   to habitat on individual primate species. This knowledge is critical to
   effective conservation. I used primate surveys, habitat analysis,
   interviews, and one year of direct observation of hunter behavior and
   catch to compare the relative impacts of altered habitat and snare
   trapping on two sympatric lemur species: the two largest-bodied and most
   endangered lemurs on the Masoala peninsula of Madagascar, Varecia rubra
   (the red ruffed lemur; Critically Endangered) and Eulemur albifrons (the
   white-fronted brown lemur; Endangered). Results indicate that alteration
   of habitat and hunting shape local faunal communities in
   species-specific ways. While alteration of habitat had a greater effect
   than snare trapping on the populations of V. rubra, snare trapping had a
   greater effect than habitat on the populations of E. albifrons.
   Therefore conservation action plans for V. rubra and E. albifrons may
   benefit from individual tailoring. These findings illustrate the need to
   consider the different manners in which habitat change and hunting
   affect sympatric primate species when designing conservation policy.},

Volume = {156},

Abstract = {There are at present few comparable studies of lemur locomotion in the
   wild. This has unfortunately meant we have little knowledge about
   locomotor variation, and hence flexibility, with regard to differences
   in support availability and habitat structure. Here we compare the
   locomotion of Lepilemur edwardsi at Ankarafantsika with that of
   Lepilemur ruficaudatus at Kirindy-Mitea National Park. While data were
   collected by two individuals, at different times, both studies used the
   same data collection protocol and are hence highly comparable. Locomotor
   mode, support diameter and orientation, heights, and distances traveled
   were all collected. We find that locomotor specialization, in this case
   for vertical leaping, has ensured that some support requirements are
   independent of habitat. For example, both species used vertical supports
   most often. However, overall support diameter does indicate a certain
   degree of flexibility, whereby L. ruficaudatus most often used supports
   5 cm in diameter and L. edwardsi >5 cm in diameter. Am J Phys Anthropol

Title = {Assessing the impacts of nonrandom seed dispersal by multiple frugivore
   partners on plant recruitment},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {96},
Number = {1},
Pages = {24-30},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Directed dispersal is defined as enhanced dispersal of seeds into
   suitable microhabitats, resulting in higher recruitment than if seeds
   were dispersed randomly. While this constitutes one of the main
   explanations for the adaptive value of frugivore-mediated seed
   dispersal, the generality of this advantage has received little study,
   particularly when multiple dispersers are involved. We used probability
   recruitment models of a long-lived rainforest tree in Madagascar to
   compare recruitment success under dispersal by multiple frugivores, no
   dispersal, and random dispersal. Models were parameterized using a
   three-year recruitment experiment and observational data of dispersal
   events by three frugivorous lemur species that commonly disperse its
   seeds. Frugivore-mediated seed dispersal was nonrandom with respect to
   canopy cover and increased modeled per-seed sapling recruitment fourfold
   compared to no dispersal. Seeds dispersed by one frugivore, Eulemur
   rubriventer, had higher modeled recruitment probability than seeds
   dispersed randomly. However, as a group, our models suggest that seeds
   dispersed by lemurs would have lower recruitment than if dispersal were
   random. Results demonstrate the importance of evaluating the
   contribution of multiple frugivores to plant recruitment for
   understanding plant population dynamics and the ecological and
   evolutionary significance of seed dispersal.},

Abstract = {Javan slow lorises (Primates: Nycticebus javanicus) are heavily
   threatened by anthropogenic disturbance and the illegal animal trade,
   both of which may impact parasite loads. They are also venomous, which
   may have evolved to help reduce parasite burdens. We present analyses of
   faecal samples for evidence of gastrointestinal parasites and data based
   on ectoparasite inspections from wild Javan slow loris collected over a
   13-month period. We sampled 21 N. jayanicus for parasites at Cipaganti,
   Garut District, West Java, Indonesia. We found most individuals were
   infected with gastrointestinal parasites. We report hookworm (Necator
   spp.) - eggs and adults; pinworms (Lemuricola spp.) - eggs and adults;
   and Trichostrongylus - eggs and adults. We found evidence for only one
   ectoparasite infection in 61 captures, this being a rash on one adult
   male. Although we could not identify the parasite, it had close
   resemblance to a skin mite species. Prevalence and intensity of
   infections with Lemuricola spp. were not related to weather periods or
   sex, but showed a tendency of fewer infections in immature slow lorises.
   The role of slow loris venom in the defence of ecto- and endoparasites
   is discussed. We emphasise the importance of natural diet to ensure an
   appropriate immune reaction including venom sequestering in rescue
   centres. Lemuricola spp. have not been documented for any other slow
   loris species which emphasises the danger of not recognising taxonomic
   differences and geographical distribution in reintroduction planning.},

Title = {Predator-Primate Distribution, Activity, and Co-occurrence in Relation
   to Habitat and Human Activity Across Fragmented and Contiguous Forests
   in Northeastern Madagascar},

Abstract = {Predator-primate interactions are understudied, yet predators have been
   shown to influence primate behavior, population dynamics, and spatial
   distribution. An understanding of these interactions is important for
   the successful management and conservation of these species. Novel
   approaches are needed to understand better the spatial relationships
   between predators and primates across changing landscapes. We combined
   photographic surveys of predators and humans with line-transect sampling
   of lemurs across contiguous and fragmented forests in Madagascar to 1)
   compare relative activity; 2) estimate probability of occupancy and
   detection; 3) estimate predator-primate and local people-primate
   co-occurrence; and 4) assess variables influencing these parameters
   across contiguous and fragmented forests. In fragmented (compared to
   contiguous) forest sites endemic predator and lemur activity were lower
   whereas introduced predator and local people activity were higher. Our
   two-species interaction occupancy models revealed a higher number of
   interactions among species across contiguous forest where predator and
   lemur occupancy were highest. Mouse lemurs show evidence of
   ``avoidance{''} (SIF < 1.0) with all predator species (endemic and
   introduced) in contiguous forest whereas white-fronted brown lemurs show
   ``attraction{''} (SIF > 1.0) with feral cats and local people in
   contiguous forest. Feral cats demonstrated the highest number of
   interactions with lemurs, despite their distribution being limited to
   only contiguous forest. Distance to forest edge and distance to nearby
   villages were important in predicting predator occupancy and detection.
   These results highlight the growing threat to endemic predators and
   lemurs as habitat loss and fragmentation increase throughout Madagascar.
   We demonstrate the effectiveness of a novel combination of techniques to
   investigate how predator species impact primate species across a
   gradient of forest fragmentation.},

Abstract = {Landscape ecologists have increasingly turned to the use of landscape
   graphs in which a landscape is represented as a set of nodes (habitat
   patches) connected by links representing inter-patch-dispersal. This
   study explores the use of a graph-based regionalization method,
   Graph-based REgionalization with Clustering And Partitioning
   (GraphRECAP), to detect structural groups of habitat patches
   (compartments) in a landscape graph such that the connections (i.e. the
   movement of individual organisms) within the groups are greater than
   those across groups. Specifically, we mapped compartments using habitat
   and dispersal data for ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) in an
   agricultural landscape in southern Madagascar using both GraphRECAP and
   the widely-used Girvan and Newman method. Model performance was
   evaluated by comparing compartment characteristics and three measures of
   network connectivity and traversability: the connection strength of
   habitat patches in the compartments (modularity), the potential ease of
   individual organism movements (Harary index), and the degree of
   alternative route presence (Alpha index). Compartments identified by
   GraphRECAP had stronger within-compartment connections, greater
   traversability, more alternative routes, and a larger minimum number of
   habitat patches within compartments, all of which are more desirable
   traits for ecological networks. Our method could thus facilitate the
   study of ecosystem resilience and the design of nature reserves and
   landscape networks to promote the landscape-scale dispersal of species
   in the fragmented habitats.},

Abstract = {The formation of autofluorescent lipopigment or lipofuscin is a highly
   consistent and reliable cytological change that correlates with cellular
   aging in postmitotic cells. One causal factor of lipofuscinogenesis
   involves free radical-induced lipid peroxidation. In mammals, dentate
   gyrus neurons and Purkinje cells are usually affected widely. In this
   study, we investigated the ultrastructure of lipofuscin deposits in
   large neurons of the dentate gyrus and in Purkinje cells of aged
   fat-tailed dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus medius Geoffroy, 1812) with
   electron and confocal microscopy and compared it with previous
   observations in other species. Cheirogaleid primates such as mouse and
   dwarf lemurs are archaic primates that provide interesting nonhuman
   models of aging. Our study revealed region-specific as well as
   species-specific characteristics of lipofuscin ultrastructure. This
   suggests differences in cellular metabolism and/or in organelles
   involved in lipofuscin production in cerebellar Purkinje cells and in
   hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons. Anat Rec, 296:1895-1906, 2013. (c)

Abstract = {Understanding the evolution of body size and sexual size dimorphism has
   been a longstanding goal in evolutionary biology. Previous work has
   shown that environmental stress can constrain male-biased sexual size
   dimorphism at the population level, but we know little about how this
   might translate to geographical patterns of body size and sexual size
   dimorphism at the species level. Environmental constraints due to a
   highly seasonal, resource-poor and/or variable environment have often
   been cited to explain the unusual lack of sexual size dimorphism among
   Madagascar's diverse and numerous primate taxa; however, empirical tests
   of this hypothesis are lacking. Using a phylogenetic approach and a
   geographical information system platform, we explored the role of
   seasonality, interannual variability and annual measures of temperature
   and rainfall, and net primary productivity on patterns of body size and
   sexual size dimorphism across 130 species of primates. Phylogenetically
   controlled comparisons showed no support for a role of environmental
   constraints in moderating sexual size dimorphism at the interspecific
   level, despite significant associations of environmental variables with
   body mass. Results suggest that the focus of discussions that have
   dominated in the last two decades regarding the role of environmental
   constraints in driving patterns of monomorphism of Madagascar's lemurs
   should be reconsidered; however, the conundrum remains.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {Two classes of vomeronasal receptor genes, V1R and V2R, occur in
   vertebrates. Whereas, V1R loci are found in a wide variety of mammals,
   including primates, intact V2R genes have thus far only been described
   in rodents and marsupials. In primates, the V2R repertoire has been
   considered degenerate. Here, we identify for the first time two intact
   V2R loci in a strepsirrhine primate, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus
   murinus), and demonstrate their expression in the vomeronasal organ.
   Putatively functional orthologues are present in two other
   strepsirrhines, whereas, both loci are pseudogenes in a range of
   anthropoid species. The functional significance of the loci is unknown,
   but positive selection on one of them is consistent with an adaptive
   role in pheromone detection. Finally, conservation of V2R loci in
   strepsirrhines is notable, given their high diversity and role in MUP
   and MHC detection in rodents.},

Title = {Is risk taking during foraging a personality trait? A field test for
   cross-context consistency in boldness},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {84},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1131-1139},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {During foraging, animals have to balance the risk of predation with the
   energy gain. The amount of risk animals take for a given resource
   depends on their energy budget but is expected also to vary between
   individuals of different personality types. We tested whether
   individuals of free-ranging grey mouse lemurs, Microcebus murinus,
   forage risk-sensitively and are consistent in their risk-taking
   behaviour. Furthermore, we tested whether boldness towards a novel
   object predicts risk taking in a foraging task. In a field experiment,
   we simulated low and high predation risk at artificial feeding sites.
   During focal platform observations, we quantified behaviours related to
   exploration and feeding for 36 individuals. Furthermore, we used a novel
   object test to quantify variation in boldness for 22 of these
   individuals. As predicted, grey mouse lemurs foraged risk-sensitively
   indicated by longer latencies to enter a feeding platform and to start
   feeding as well as by relatively longer feeding time compared to
   nonfeeding in high-risk situations. Individual differences in risk
   taking were repeatable and repeatability increased with increasing risk.
   Individual plasticity was higher for low-risk individuals providing
   field evidence for coping styles. There was no relationship between
   individual body condition and risk-taking behaviour. Finally, boldness
   measured in a novel object test was correlated with risk taking in a
   foraging task, providing a rare ecological validation for this
   personality trait. These results suggest that intrinsic individual
   differences in boldness need to be considered as an important source of
   variation when testing predictions of risk-sensitive foraging using
   optimality approaches. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {Primates are a global conservation priority, with half of known species
   considered threatened with extinction. Monitoring trends in primate
   populations is important for identifying species in particular need of
   conservation action, and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions.
   Most existing primate survey methods aim to measure abundance. However,
   obtaining estimates of abundance with acceptable precision to detect
   changes in population is often expensive and time consuming. Evidence
   from other taxa suggests that estimating occupancy (the proportion of
   the area used by the species) may be less resource-intensive, yet still
   provide useful information for monitoring population trends. We
   investigate the potential of occupancy modelling for monitoring forest
   primates using a case study of three species of diurnal lemurs in the
   eastern rainforest of Madagascar. We estimated detectability and
   occupancy from a survey with three visits to 30 sites. Our estimates
   suggest that precision in occupancy estimates would be maximized by
   visiting a larger number of sites (therefore with limited repeat visits)
   for Indri indri, whereas the optimal monitoring design for Eulemur
   fulvus and Propithecus diadema, which showed very low detectability in
   our surveys, involves more frequent visits to fewer sites. Power
   analyses suggested that a meaningful reduction in occupancy could be
   detected with reasonable effort for easily detected species, but the
   method may prove impractical for more cryptic species. Primates pose a
   number of practical challenges for occupancy modelling, including
   choosing appropriate survey designs to satisfy closure assumptions. We
   suggest that if these issues can be overcome, occupancy modelling has
   the potential to become a valuable addition to the monitoring toolbox
   for the study of forest primates.},

Title = {Novel approach for quantifying illegal bushmeat consumption reveals high
   consumption of protected species in Madagascar},

Abstract = {Information on the extent of bushmeat hunting is needed to assess the
   likely impact on hunted species, to provide information on the
   opportunity cost to local people of conservation, and to judge the
   efficacy of interventions at reducing pressure. However, where hunting
   is illegal, or socially unacceptable, respondents may not answer
   honestly to direct questions about hunting or consumption of bushmeat.
   We adapted a specialized method for investigating sensitive behaviours
   (the randomized response technique, RRT) and questioned 1,851 people in
   Madagascar about their consumption of six species, using either RRT or
   direct questions. For most species at most sites RRT and direct
   questions returned similar estimates of the proportion of the population
   who had consumed bushmeat in the previous year. However, RRT resulted in
   significantly higher estimates of bushmeat consumption in communities
   surrounding a protected area, where conservation activities made such
   questions sensitive. RRT has been predominately used in Europe and the
   USA; we demonstrate that it can provide a valuable approach for studying
   rule-breaking among people with poor literacy in low income countries.
   Between 12 and 33\% of people across our sites had eaten brown lemur
   (Eulemur spp.), and 12-29\% had eaten sifaka (Propithecus spp.) in the
   previous year. These results add to the growing body of evidence that
   hunting of protected species in Madagascar is a serious problem
   requiring urgent action. Conservation interventions to tackle bushmeat
   hunting will make questions about hunting or consumption more sensitive,
   increasing the need for researchers to use appropriate approaches for
   asking sensitive questions.},

Abstract = {The draft genome sequences of several primates are available, providing
   insights into evolutionary and anthropological research. However,
   genomic resources from New World monkeys are conspicuously lacking. To
   date, the genomes of only two platyrrhine species, the common marmoset
   and the Bolivian squirrel monkey, have been fully sequenced. This is
   especially limiting for comparative genomics research, considering that
   New World monkeys are the most speciose primate group, and platyrrhine
   genetic diversity is comparable to that of the catarrhines (i.e. apes
   and Old World monkeys). Here, we present the generation and annotation
   of numerous sequence reads from the genomes of Spider monkey (Ateles
   belzebuth), Owl monkey (Aotus lemurinus) and Uakari (Cacajao calvus),
   representing the three platyrrhine families, Atelidae, Cebidae and
   Pitheciidae, respectively. These sequencing reads were developed from
   gDNA shotgun libraries containing over 3000 individual sequences with an
   average length of 726 bps. Of these sequences, 1220 contain <20\%
   repeats, and thus are potentially highly useful phylogenetic markers for
   other platyrrhine species. Among them, a large number of sequencing
   reads were found to match unique regions within the human (2462
   sequences) and the marmoset (2829 sequences) genomes. In particular, the
   majority of these sequencing reads are from putatively neutrally
   evolving intergenic regions. Thus, they are likely to be highly
   informative for inferring neutral evolutionary patterns and genomic
   evolution for other New World monkeys.},

Title = {The claustrum and insula in Microcebus murinus: a high resolution
   diffusion imaging study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 13},
Abstract = {The claustrum and the insula are closely juxtaposed in the brain of the
   prosimian primate, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). Whether
   the claustrum has closer affinities with the cortex or the striatum has
   been debated for many decades. Our observation of histological sections
   from primate brains and genomic data in the mouse suggest former. Given
   this, the present study compares the connections of the two structures
   in Micro-cebus using high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI,
   with 72 directions), with a very small voxel size (90 micra), and
   probabilistic fiber tractography. High angular and spatial resolution
   diffusion imaging is non-destructive, requires no surgical
   interventions, and the connection of each and every voxel can be mapped,
   whereas in conventional tract tracer studies only a few specific
   injection sites can be assayed. Our data indicate that despite the high
   genetic and spatial affinities between the two structures, their
   connectivity patterns are very different. The claustrum connects with
   many cortical areas and the olfactory bulb; its strongest probabilistic
   connections are with the entorhinal cortex, suggesting that the
   claustrum may have a role in spatial memory and navigation. By contrast,
   the insula connects with many subcortical areas, including the brainstem
   and thalamic structures involved in taste and visceral feelings.
   Overall, the connections of the Microcebus claustrum and insula are
   similar to those of the rodents, cat, macaque, and human, validating our
   results. The insula in the Microcebus connects with the dorsolateral
   frontal cortex in contrast to the mouse insula, which has stronger
   connections with the ventromedial frontal lobe, yet this is consistent
   with the dorsolateral expansion of the frontal cortex in primates. In
   addition to revealing the connectivity patterns of the Microcebus brain,
   our study demonstrates that HARDI, at high resolutions, can be a
   valuable tool for mapping fiber pathways for multiple sites in fixed
   brains in rare and difficult-to-obtain species.},

Title = {Evaluating the Phylogenetic Position of Chinese Tree Shrew (Tupaia
   belangeri chinensis) Based on Complete Mitochondrial Genome: Implication
   for Using Tree Shrew as an Alternative Experimental Animal to Primates
   in Biomedical Research},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GENETICS AND GENOMICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {131-137},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) is currently placed in Order Scandentia
   and has a wide distribution in Southeast Asia and Southwest China. Due
   to its unique characteristics, such as small body size, high
   brain-to-body mass ratio, short reproductive cycle and life span, and
   low-cost of maintenance, tree shrew has been proposed to be an
   alternative experimental animal to primates in biomedical research.
   However, there are some debates regarding the exact phylogenetic
   affinity of tree shrew to primates. In this study, we determined the
   mtDNA entire genomes of three Chinese tree shrews (T. belangeri
   chinensis) and one Malayan flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus).
   Combined with the published data for species in Euarchonta, we intended
   to discern the phylogenetic relationship among representative species of
   Dermoptera, Scandentia and Primates. The mtDNA genomes of Chinese tree
   shrews and Malayan flying lemur shared similar gene organization and
   structure with those of other mammals. Phylogenetic analysis based on 12
   concatenated mitochondrial protein-encoding genes revealed a closer
   relationship between species of Scandentia and Glires, whereas species
   of Dermoptera were clustered with Primates. This pattern was consistent
   with previously reported phylogeny based on mtDNA data, but differed
   from the one reconstructed on the basis of nuclear genes. Our result
   suggested that the matrilineal affinity of tree shrew to primates may
   not be as close as we had thought. The ongoing project for sequencing
   the entire genome of Chinese tree shrew will provide more information to
   clarify this important issue.},

Abstract = {Large-brained diurnal mammals with complex social systems are known to
   plan where and how to reach a resource, as shown by a systematic
   movement pattern analysis. We examined for the first time large-scale
   movement patterns of a solitary-ranging and small-brained mammal, the
   mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), by using the change-point test and a
   heuristic random travel model to get insight into foraging strategies
   and potential route-planning abilities. Mouse lemurs are small nocturnal
   primates inhabiting the seasonal dry deciduous forest in Madagascar.
   During the lean season with limited food availability, these lemurs rely
   on few stationary food resources. We radio-tracked seven lemurs and
   analysed their foraging patterns. First change-points coincided with
   out-of-sight keystone food resources. Travel paths were more efficient
   in detecting these resources than a heuristic random travel model within
   limits of estimated detection distance. Findings suggest that even
   nocturnal, solitary-ranging mammals with small brains plan their route
   to an out-of-sight target. Thus, similar ecological pressures may lead
   to comparable spatial cognitive skills irrespective of the degree of
   sociality or relative brain size.},

Title = {Comparing Aye-Aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) Presence and

   National Park, Madagascar},

Abstract = {The aye-aye is considered the most widely distributed lemur in
   Madagascar; however, the effect of forest quality on aye-aye abundance
   is unknown. We compared aye-aye presence across degraded and
   non-degraded forest at Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. We used
   secondary signs (feeding sites, high activity sites) as indirect cues of
   aye-aye presence and Canarium trees as an indicator of resource
   availability. All 3 measured variables indicated higher aye-aye
   abundance within non-degraded forest; however, the differences across
   forest type were not significant. Both degraded and non-degraded forests
   showed a positive correlation between feeding sites and high activity
   sites. We found that Canarium, an important aye-aye food source, was
   rare and had limited dispersal, particularly across degraded forest.
   This preliminary study provides baseline data for aye-aye activity and
   resource utilization across degraded and non-degraded forests. Copyright

Volume = {142},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Little is known about ingested food size (V-b) in primates, even though
   this variable has potentially important effects on food intake and
   processing. This study provides the first data on V-b in strepsirrhine
   primates using a captive sample of 17 species. These data can be used
   for generating and testing models of feeding energetics. Strepsirrhines
   are of interest because they are hypometabolic and chewing rate and
   daily feeding time do not show a significant scaling relationship with
   body size. Using melon, carrot, and sweet potato we found that maximum
   V-b scales isometrically with body mass and mandible length. Low dietary
   quality in larger strepsirrhines might explain why V-b increases with
   body size at a greater rate than does resting metabolic rate. Relative
   to body size, V-b is large in frugivores but small in folivores;
   furthermore scaling slopes are higher in frugivores than in folivores. A
   gross estimate of dietary quality explains much of the variation in V-b
   that is not explained by body size. Gape adaptations might favor
   habitually large bites for frugivores and small ones for folivores. More
   data are required for several feeding variables and for wild
   populations. Am J Phys Anthropol 142:625-635, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {We assessed the consumption and hunting of wild animals by people in
   urban areas of western Madagascar using structured questionnaires in
   households and direct observations. Six wild mammal and five wild bird
   species were reported, or observed, to be sources of bushmeat although
   fish and domestic animals were the preferred and cheapest sources of
   animal protein. Bushmeat accounted for 10\% of the meat consumed the day
   before our questionnaires were completed. Common tenrec Tenrec ecaudatus
   and bush pig Potamochoerus larvatus were the preferred wild meat and the
   former was also the most expensive type of meat. Taboos and strong
   dislikes limited the consumption of domestic pigs, bush pigs, goats,
   lemurs and fruit bats. Game species were hunted according to their
   availability, which coincided with the legal hunting season for fruit
   bats but only partly so for the other game species. Illegal hunting of
   Verreauxi's sifaka Propithecus verreauxi is cause for concern and
   assessments of primate consumption may have been underestimated because
   of reluctance of interviewees to admit illegal activities.},

Volume = {72},

Abstract = {Few Malagasy children and adults are aware of the rare and unique fauna
   and flora indigenous to their island-continent, including flagship lemur
   species. Even the Malagasy ancestral proverbs never mentioned lemurs,
   but these same proverbs talked about the now extinct hippopotamus.
   Madagascar's geography, history, and economic constraints contribute to
   severe biodiversity loss. Deforestation on Madagascar is reported to be
   over 100,000 ha/year, with only 10-15\% of the island retaining natural
   forest {[}Green \& Sussman, 1990]. Educating children, teacher-training,
   and community projects about environmental and conservation efforts to
   protect the remaining natural habitats of endangered lemur species
   provide a basis for long-term changes in attitudes and practices. Case
   studies of three conservation education projects located in different
   geographical regions of Madagascar, Centre ValBio, Madagacar Wildlife
   Conservation Alaotra Comic Book Project, and The Ako Book Project, are
   presented together with their ongoing stages of development, assessment,
   and outcomes. We argue that while nongovernmental organizational efforts
   are and will be very important, the Ministry of Education urgently needs
   to incorporate biodiversity education in the curriculum at all levels,
   from primary school to university. Am. J. Primatol. 72:391-406, 2010.

Abstract = {Two infanticides occurred after a male takeover in a population of

   Special Reserve, Madagascar. The first infant was found dying from
   wounds received to the chest and groin after three adult males had
   immigrated into the group. The second infanticide was directly observed
   2 weeks later when one of the immigrant males targeted and attacked the
   infant after it was separated from its mother. The directed nature of
   the attack suggests that the infant's death was not a result of
   generalized aggression during a period of increased group instability.
   Although the sexual selection argument does not fully explain
   infanticidal events in seasonally breeding lemurs, such as Verreaux's
   sifaka, it is clear that transferring males present a measurable threat
   to infant survival and female reproductive success in this species.},

Abstract = {Lac Alaotra is Madagascar's largest take and a recognized wetland of
   international importance under the Ramsar Convention. It supports
   several Critically Endangered species, including the Alaotran gentle
   lemur Hapalemur alaotrensis. A principal threat facing the remaining
   Alaotran wetland is anthropogenic burning of the vegetation during the
   dry season; a practice now officially banned. A number of reasons have
   been given to explain this but to date no attempt has been made to
   investigate the principal motivations for the burning. We present the
   results of semi-structured interviews (n = 27) and questionnaires (n =
   122) in a lakeside town. Seventy-eight percent of interviewees stated
   wetland burning was performed only or mainly to gather an introduced
   fish, the Asian snakehead Channa maculata, which buries into the
   underlying substrate during the dry season. Sixty-eight percent of
   questionnaire respondents provided a similar explanation. These data
   provide valuable insights into the reasons for the ongoing burning and
   should inform the management actions that are required to protect this
   globally important wetland.},

   the amount of protected areas in Madagascar by 2009. This extensive
   expansion needs to involve an assessment of the potential impacts on the
   people who rely on forest resources for subsistence. Wildlife for human
   consumption (bushmeat) is one such resource that has received great
   attention on mainland Africa but has largely been ignored in Madagascar
   until recently. In terms of biomass, hunting in Madagascar appears to be
   on a lesser scale compared to areas of mainland Africa. However, because
   of the life-history characteristics associated with hunted primate and
   carnivore species in Madagascar even small-scale hunting is a major
   threat to long-term conservation. In this study I used semi-structured
   interviews to quantify annual rates of bushmeat harvest in 14 villages
   adjacent to the Makira Forest in north-eastern Madagascar. Interviews
   revealed that 23 mammal species were hunted for consumption, providing a
   new insight into the scale and frequency of bushmeat use. Harvest data
   and life-history information were sufficient to allow quantitative
   assessments of sustainability for four species of lemur (black and white
   ruffed lemur Varecia variegata, indri Indri indri, eastern bamboo lemur
   Hapalemur griseus and white-fronted brown lemur Eulemur albifrons) and a
   species of the carnivore family Eupleridae (fossa Cryptoprocta ferox).
   Model results suggest hunting of these species is probably
   unsustainable. This research presents clear evidence that hunting is a
   major conservation and livelihoods issue in Madagascar and needs to be
   considered in the planning stages of protected area development to
   address better the needs of local people.},

Title = {Food Mechanical Properties in Three Sympatric Species of Hapalemur in

Abstract = {We investigated mechanical dietary properties of sympatric bamboo
   lemurs, Hapalemur g. griseus, H. aureus, and H. (Prolemur) simus, in
   Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. Each lemur species relies on
   bamboo, though previous behavioral observations found that they
   specialize on different parts of a common resource (Tan: Int J Primatol
   20 {[}1999] 547-566; Tan: PhD dissertation {[}2000] State University of
   New York, Stony Brook). On the basis of these earlier behavioral ecology
   studies, we hypothesized that specialization on bamboo is related to
   differences in mechanical properties of specific parts. We quantified
   mechanical properties of individual plant parts from the diets of the
   bamboo lemur species using a portable tester. The diets of the Hapalemur
   spp. exhibited high levels of mechanical heterogeneity. The lemurs,
   however, could be segregated based on the most challenging (i.e.,
   mechanically demanding) foods. Giant bamboo culm pith was the toughest
   and stiffest food eaten, and its sole lemur consumer, H. simus, had the
   most challenging diet. However, the mechanical dietary properties of H.
   simus and H. aureus overlapped considerably. In the cases where lemur
   species converged on the same bamboo part, the size of the part eaten
   increased with body size. Plant parts that were harvested orally but not
   necessarily masticated were the most demanding, indicating that food
   preparation may place significant loads on the masticatory apparatus.
   Finally, we describe how mechanical properties can influence feeding
   behavior. The elaborate procurement processes of H. simus feeding on
   culm pith and H. griseus and H. aureus feeding on young leaf bases are
   related to the toughnesses of protective coverings and the lemurs'
   exploitation of mechanical vulnerabilities in these plants. Am J Phys

Abstract = {We describe a new species of Hyalinobatrachium from the Amazonian slopes
   of the Andes in Peru and Bolivia on the basis of morphological,
   bioacoustic and genetic characteristics. Hyalinobatrachium carlesvilai
   sp. nov. can be distinguished from other species of Hyalinobatrachium by
   the combination of the following characters: (1) truncate snout in
   dorsal and lateral view; (2) white pericardium; (3) enameled dorsal,
   tarsal and cloacal folds; (4) hand webbing formula III 2(-) -1(+) IV;
   (5) iris cream; (6) advertisement call consisting of a single,
   frequency-modulated note with a pulsed section followed by a tonal
   section. The new species had been previously identified as
   Hyalinobatrachium munozorum and H. bergeri. The advertisement call of
   the new species was previously assigned to H. bergeri. Here we describe
   the previously unknown call of Hyalinobatrachium bergeri. Additionally,
   we study the taxonomic status of H. lemur and H. pellucidum and place
   the former as synonym of the later. We extend the distribution of H.

Title = {Visual Acuity in the Cathemeral Strepsirrhine Eulemur macaco flavifrons},

Abstract = {Studies of visual acuity in primates have shown that diurnal haplorhines
   have higher acuity (30-75 cycles per degree (c/deg)) than most other
   mammals. However, relatively little is known about visual acuity in
   non-haplorhine primates, and published estimates are only available for
   four strepsirrhine genera (Microcebus, Otolemur, Galago, and Lemur). We
   present here the first measurements of visual acuity in a cathemeral
   strepsirrhine species, the blue-eyed black lemur (Eulemur macaco
   flavifrons). Acuity in two subjects, a 3-year-old male and a 16-year-old
   female, was assessed behaviorally using a two-alternative forced choice
   discrimination task. Visual stimuli consisted of high contrast square
   wave gratings of seven spatial frequencies. Acuity threshold was
   determined using a 70\% correct response criterion. Results indicate a
   maximum visual acuity of 5.1 c/deg for the female (1718 trials) and 3.8
   c/deg for the male (846 trials). These values for E. macaco are slightly
   lower than those reported for diurnal Lemur catta, and are generally
   comparable to those reported for nocturnal Microcebus murinus and
   Otolemur crassicaudatus. To examine ecological sources of variation in
   primate visual acuity, we also calculated maximum theoretical acuity for
   Cheirogaleus medius (2.8 c/deg) and Tarsius syrichta (8-9 c/deg) using
   published data on retinal ganglion cell density and eye morphology.
   These data suggest that visual acuity in primates may be influenced by
   activity pattern, diet, and phylogenetic history. In particular, the
   relatively high acuity of T. syrichta and Galago senegalensis suggests
   that visual predation may be an important selective factor favoring high
   visual acuity in primates. Am. J. Primatol. 71:343-352, 2009. (C) 2009

Abstract = {We have been developing A beta derivative vaccines with the objective to
   improve the safety of A beta targeting immunotherapy. Our A beta
   homologs are designed to have less direct toxicity and to produce a
   modified immune response compared to A beta. In extensive mouse Studies,
   all Our vaccines have improved cognition in transgenic mice while
   eliciting different immune responses and reducing brain amyloid burden
   to a variable degree. While we are continuing to characterize these
   vaccines in mice, in preparation for Studies in old primates and for
   human trials we assessed their effect ill Young lemur primates (n = 25)
   that with age develop A beta plaques and tau aggregates as seen in
   Alzheimer's disease. In the primates, all the peptides administered with
   alum adjuvant elicited a moderate to robust anti-A beta IgM response. A
   beta 1-42, K6A beta 1-30 and K6A beta 1-30{[}E18E19] resulted in a high
   anti-A beta IgG response, whereas A beta 1-30{[}E18E19] produced a
   weaker more variable IgG titer. Notably, 22 weeks after the 3rd
   immunization, IgM and IgG levels in derivative-vaccinated primates were
   similar to preimmune values whereas A beta 1-42 treated primates
   maintained a moderate IgG titer. The increase in antibodies that
   recognized A beta 1-40 often correlated with increase in A beta 1-40 in
   plasma, which suggests that the antibodies were binding to A beta in
   vivo. Interestingly, significant transient weight gain was observed (K6A
   beta 1-30-, A beta 1-30{[}E18E19]- and A beta 1-42-treated) or a trend
   in the same direction (K6A beta 1-30{[}E18E19]-treated. adjuvant
   controls) following the injections. Based on these findings, we have
   chosen K6A beta 1-30 for immunizations in old primates as the antibody
   response to this vaccine was less variable compared to other A
   derivatives. Our present findings indicate that most of our A beta
   derivatives elicit a substantial antibody response in primates, and
   importantly this effect is reversible which enhances the safety profile
   of our approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-71},

Abstract = {Much research has focused on identifying traits that can act as useful
   indicators of how habitat loss affects the extinction risk of species,
   and the results are mixed. We developed 2 simple, rapid-assessment
   models of the susceptibility of species to habitat loss. We based both
   on an index of range size, but one also incorporated an index of body
   mass and the other an index combining habitat and dietary
   specialization. We applied the models to samples of birds (Accipitridae
   and Bucerotidae) and to the lemurs of Madagascar and compared the
   models' classifications of risk with the IUCN's global threat status of
   each species. The model derived from ecological attributes was much more
   robust than the one derived from body mass. Ecological attributes
   identified threatened birds and lemurs with an average of 80\% accuracy
   and endangered and critically endangered species with 100\% accuracy and
   identified some species not currently listed as threatened that almost
   certainly warrant conservation consideration. Appropriate analysis of
   even fairly crude biological information can help raise early-warning
   flags to the relative susceptibilities of species to habitat loss and
   thus provide a useful and rapid technique for highlighting potential
   species-level conservation issues. Advantages of this approach to
   classifying risk include flexibility in the specialization parameters
   used as well as its applicability at a range of spatial scales.},

Abstract = {Primates grow and develop slowly for mammalian standards. Charnov showed
   that primates grow at only about 40\% of the rates observed in other
   mammals of similar size. However, previous estimates of growth rates in
   primates were derived from regressions of adult body weight on age at
   first reproduction in different species, and therefore represent only an
   average trend for primates. Based on Charnov's `growth law', we
   estimated the growth constant A directly from published growth curves
   for 36 primate species from strepsirrhines to apes. We show that
   although primate growth is slow in all sampled species in comparison
   with the mammalian average, there is significant variation around the
   primate mean. Lemurids are particularly interesting due to their wide
   range of A values, and further study is required to determine whether
   environmental unpredictability could lead to the evolution of both very
   fast and very slow grow in different species. Results also indicate
   significant negative correlations between the growth constant A and both
   age at first reproduction and duration of the juvenile period, lending
   support to the juvenile risk hypothesis.},

Title = {New hand bones of Hadropithecus stenognathus: implications for the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {A partial, associated skeleton of Hadropithecus stenognathus (AHA-I) was
   discovered in 2003 at Andrahomana Cave in southeastern Madagascar. Among
   the postcranial elements found were the first hand bones (right
   scaphoid, right hamate, left first metacarpal, and right and left fifth
   metacarpals) attributed to this rare subfossil lemur. These hand bones
   were compared to those of extant strepsirrhines and catarrhines in order
   to infer the positional adaptations of Hadropithecits, and they were
   compared to those of Archaeolemur in order to assess variation in hand
   morphology among archaeolemurids. The scaphoid tubercle does not project
   palmarly as in suspensory and climbing taxa, and the hamate has no hook
   at all Oust a small tubercle), which also points to a poorly developed
   carpal tunnel. There is a distinctive, radioulnarly directed
   ``spiral{''} facet for articulation with the triquetrum that is most
   similar in orientation to that of more terrestrial primates (i.e., Lemur
   catta, Papio, and Gorilla). The first metacarpal is very reduced and
   represents only 48\% of the length of metacarpal V, as in Archaeolemur,
   which suggests that pollical grasping of arboreal supports was not
   important. Compared to Archaeolemur, the shaft of metacarpal V is
   gracile, and the head has no dorsal ridge and lacks characteristics
   functionally associated with digitigrade, extended metacarpophalangeal
   joint postures. Proximally, the articular facet for the hamate is
   oriented more dorsally. Thus, the carpometacarpal joint V appears to
   have a distinctive hyperextended set, which has no analog among living
   or extinct primates. The carpals of Hadropithecus are diagnostic of a
   pronograde, arboreal and terrestrial (although not digitigrade)
   locomotor repertoire that typifies Lemur catta and some Old World
   monkeys. No clinging, suspensory, or climbing specializations that
   characterize indriids or lorises can be found in the hand of this
   subfossil lemur. The hand of Hadropithecus likely had similar ranges of
   movement at the radiocarpal and midcarpal joints as of those of
   pronograde primates, such as lemurids, for which the hand is held in a
   more extended, pronated, and neutral (i.e., showing less ulnar
   deviation) position during locomotion in comparison to that of vertical
   clingers or slow climbers. Although highly autapomorphic, the hand of
   Hadropithecus resembles that of its sister taxon, Archaeolemur, in
   having a very reduced pollex and an articular facet on the scaphoid for
   a sizeable prepollex. These unusual hand features reinforce the
   monophyly of the Archaeolemuridae. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {We describe the diet of fossas (Cryptoprocta ferox) in a dry deciduous
   forest of western Madagascar from 376 scats collected between June 1994
   and September 1996, from which 554 prey items were identified. More than
   90\% of these were vertebrates, and more than 50\% were lemurs. No other
   nonprimate mammal includes such a high proportion of primate items in
   its diet. The principal prey comprised approximately 6 lemur species and
   2 or 3 spiny tenrec species, along with snakes and small mammals.
   Significant differences were apparent in the composition of the scats in
   wet and dry seasons, with a higher proportion of Tenrec in the former,
   and fewer lemurs. Within the confines of a diet of vertebrates, fossas
   appeared to be opportunistic predators. For those prey types for which
   data were available, a significant relationship was found between the
   estimated relative number of individuals taken of any one type of prey
   and its abundance. Fossas were estimated to remove up to 19\% of their
   prey populations per year. This high impact suggests that they were
   living close to the maximum population density possible on the available
   prey. Species of a wide range of body masses were included in the diet.
   Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi), weighing more than one-half
   of the body mass of the fossa, constituted approximately 11\% of the
   prey biomass.},

Abstract = {Previous analyses of symphyseal fusion in the extinct Malagasy lemur
   Archaeolemur identified several functional characteristics of joint
   morphology that vary postnatally (Ravosa and Simons in American Journal
   of Physical Anthropology 95:63-76, 1994). To complement that study, we
   used an imaging technique (microCT) that provides novel data on
   ontogenetic and local variation in biomineralization along the
   mandibular symphysis before complete ossification among adult
   Archaeolemur. Our sample of unfused symphyses comprised juveniles from
   the 2 earliest postnatal dental ages examined previously. We imaged each
   specimen (ca.18 mu m volume elements) with slices parallel to the
   coronal plane, i.e., orthogonal to the joint articular surface. In <= 5
   labiolingually equidistant joint sites, we collected 40 contiguous
   slices (18-mu m intervals). Each of the 5 joint sites is represented by
   1 slice, with biomineralization values sampled at 5 equidistant points
   along the articular surface and at 3 external cortical bone points. Our
   analysis of Archaeolemur indicates the presence of ontogenetic increases
   in bone mineral density accompanying increases in joint size and the
   number and distribution of symphyseal rugosities. Such postnatal changes
   are particularly marked for the middle of the joint presumed to lie
   adjacent to a degrading fibrocartilage pad. In Archaeolemur, labial
   regions of the symphysis ossify earlier and are likewise more
   biomineralized. Ontogenetic increases in symphyseal biomineralization,
   overall size, and fusion are consistent with elevated masticatory
   stresses owing to the postweaning shift to adult-like feeding behaviors.
   However, the labiolingual pattern of fusion and biomineralization in
   Archaeolemur appears related more to constraints on synostosis owing to
   the lingually located vascular supply characteristic of mammalian
   symphyses.},

Abstract = {The papers in this special issue examine the relationship between social
   and ecological cognition in primates. We refer to the intersection of
   these two domains as socioecological cognition. Examples of
   socioecological cognition include socially learned predator alarm calls
   and socially sensitive foraging decisions. In this review we consider
   how primate cognition may have been shaped by the interaction of social
   and ecological influences in their evolutionary history. The ability to
   remember distant, out-of-sight locations is an ancient one, shared by
   many mammals and widespread among primates. It seems some monkeys and
   apes have evolved the ability to form more complex representations of
   resources, integrating ``what-where-how much{''} information. This
   ability allowed anthropoids to live in larger, more cohesive groups by
   minimizing competition for limited resources between group members. As
   group size increased, however, competition for resources also increased,
   selecting for enhanced social skills. Enhanced social skills in turn
   made a more sophisticated relationship to the environment possible. The
   interaction of social and ecological influences created a spiraling
   effect in the evolution of primate intelligence. In contrast, lemurs may
   not have evolved the ability to form complex representations which would
   allow them to consider the size and location of resources. This lack in
   lemur ecological cognition may restrict the size of frugivorous lemur
   social groups, thereby limiting the complexity of lemur social life. In
   this special issue, we have brought together two review papers, five
   field studies, and one laboratory study to investigate the interaction
   of social and ecological factors in relation to foraging. Our goal is to
   stimulate research that considers social and ecological factors acting
   together on cognitive evolution, rather than in isolation. Cross
   fertilization of experimental and observational studies from captivity
   and the field is important for increasing our understanding of this
   relationship.},

Title = {Frequency and timing of scaphoid-centrale fusion in hominoids},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {321-340},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Fusion between the os centrale and the scaphoid has played a central
   role in many functional and phylogenetic interpretations of hominoid
   evolution. In particular, scaphoid-centrale fusion shared among African
   apes and humans has been interpreted as an adaptation in
   knuckle-walkers, an exaptation in hominins, and has been offered as
   evidence for a knuckle-walking origin of bipedalism. However,
   discrepancies in the literature concerning the taxa in which this
   scaphoid-centrale fusion occurs, as well as the timing and/or frequency
   of this fusion, have confounded the significance of this trait. This
   study provides an historical review of the literature on
   scaphoid-centrale fusion in primates and the first formal investigation
   into the timing and frequency of this character among primates, with a
   focus on extant hominoids. Results indicate that there is a significant
   difference in the timing and frequency of scaphoid-centrale fusion in
   African apes and humans compared to Asian apes, suggesting that prenatal
   or early postnatal fusion among hominines is a synapomorphy.
   Scaphoid-centrale fusion does not occur randomly within primates.
   Instead, only Homininae and some members of Lemuroidea show consistent
   and ontogenetically early fusion of these carpals. The consistent
   occurrence of this trait within only two primate clades and a clear
   heterochronic trend in timing and frequency of scaphoid-centrale fusion
   among hominines suggest that this character is primarily
   phylogenetically controlled. We could not falsify the hypothesis that
   scaphoid-centrale fusion in African apes is indeed related to midcarpal
   stability in knuckle-walking, but neither were we able to find direct
   biomechanical or kinematic evidence to support this hypothesis. A more
   definitive answer to the question of the functional significance of
   scaphoid-centrale fusion will have to await more detailed analyses of
   great ape wrist kinematics. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by

Pages = {1569-1588},

Abstract = {We investigated how greater dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus major) densities,
   ambient air temperature, and dendrometrics (tree height and diameter)
   varied along forest edge-interior gradients in the Vohibola III
   Classified Forest in SE Madagascar. We also assessed if spatial
   variations in densities of Cheirogaleus major provide indirect evidence
   of increased predation pressure in the transition zone between edge and
   interior forest habitats, i.e., an ecological trap. We conducted diurnal
   temperature surveys (N = 394) and nocturnal surveys of Cheirogaleus
   major (N = 182) over 2 yr along 4 1250-m transects that ran
   perpendicular to the forest edge in Vohibola III. We did not see
   Cheirogaleus major from May to mid-September, and the highest sighting
   frequency occurred during October-November. Cheirogaleus major exhibited
   a negative edge response because densities ranged from low levels in
   edge habitats to higher levels in the forest interior. After we tested
   for spatial autocorrelation, edge-related variations in densities of
   Cheirogaleus major covaried most strongly with tree diameter. Edge
   responses of Cheirogaleus major may reflect spatial variations in fruit
   and liana abundance, though data are needed on the precise relationship
   between tree diameter and food production to confirm the relationship.
   Edge-related variations in densities of Cheirogaleus major may also
   provide indirect evidence of an ecological trap. Testing and controlling
   for spatial autocorrelation should be important components of future
   studies of primate conservation biology and ecology.},

Abstract = {Remains of what appears to be a single, subadult Hadropithecus
   stenognathus were recovered from a previously unexcavated site at
   Andrahomana Cave (southeastern Madagascar). Specimens found comprise
   isolated teeth and cranial fragments (including the frontal processes of
   the orbits), as well as a partial postcranial skeleton. They include the
   first associated fore- and hind-limb bones, confirming the hind-limb
   attributions made by Godfrey and co-workers in 1997, and refuting
   earlier attributions by Lamberton in 1937/1938. Of particular interest
   here are the previously unknown elements, including a sacrum, other
   vertebrae and ribs, some hand bones, and the distal epiphysis of a
   femur. We briefly discuss the functional implications of previously
   unknown elements.
   Hadropithecus displayed a combination of characters reminiscent of
   lemurids, others more like those of the larger-bodied Old World monkeys,
   and still others more like those of African apes. Yet other
   characteristics appear unique. Lemurid-like postcranial characteristics
   may be primitive for the Archaeolemuridae. Hadropithecus diverges from
   the Lemuridae in the direction of Archaeolemur, but more extremely so.
   Thus, for example, it exhibits a stronger reduction in the size of the
   hamulus of the hamate, greater anteroposterior compression of the
   femoral shaft, and greater asymmetry of the femoral condyles. Nothing in
   its postcranial anatomy signals a close relationship to either the
   Indriidae or the Palaeopropithecidae. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {In many primate species, hands and feet are large relative to neonatal
   body weight, and they subsequently exhibit negative allometric growth
   during ontogeny. Here, data are presented showing that this pattern
   holds for a wild population of lemur, Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus
   verreauxi verreauxi). Using morphometric data collected on this
   population, it is shown that younger animals possess relatively large
   hands and feet. This ontogenetic pattern suggests a simple behavioral
   test: do juvenile animals with their larger, almost adult-sized hands
   and feet locomote on similarly sized substrates as adult animals? Using
   locomotor bout sampling, this question was tested by collecting
   positional behavior data on this population. Results from this test find
   no differences in locomotor behaviors or substrate use between yearlings
   and adult animals. To place these results in a broader evolutionary
   context, heritabilities and selection gradients of hands, feet, and
   other limb elements for animals in this population were estimated. Among
   limb elements, heritabilities range from 0.16-0.44, with the foot having
   the lowest value. Positive directional selection acts most strongly on
   the foot (directional selection gradient = 0.119). The low heritability
   and positive selection coefficient indicate that selection has acted,
   and continues to act, on foot size in young animals. These results are
   interpreted within a functional context with respect to the development
   of locomotor coordination: larger feet enable young animals to use
   ``adult-sized{''} substrates when they move through their habitat. It is
   suggested that the widespread pattern of negative allometry of the
   extremities in sifaka and other primates is maintained by selection, and
   does not simply reflect a primitive developmental pathway that has no
   adaptive basis.},

Abstract = {Exploration for placer deposits, especially for ilmenites, has been
   undertaken systematically in the southern coast of Tamil Nadu, India. On
   the basis of drainage network. Coastal landforms, lithology, and
   neotectonics, the study area has been grouped into five sectors:
   Mandapam, Valinokkam, Tuticorin, Manappad, and Kanyakumari. Ilmenites
   are abundant in Kanyakumari (Max. 53.39 wt\%) and Tuticorin (Max. 20.88
   wt\%) sectors, negligible in Manappad (Max. 0.60 wt\%) and Valinokkam
   (Max. 3.88 wt\%) sectors and absent in the Mandapam sector. The abnormal
   enrichment of ilmenites in the Kanyakumari sector in the absence of any
   drainage network points to the possibility of a relict source. Literary
   and scientific evidence corroborates the existence of an Eastern
   Gondwana land called Lemuria, South of Kanyakumari which was later
   submerged in the Flandrian transgression. The association of other heavy
   minerals with ilmenites like overgrown and outgrown zircon supplements
   the idea of a longer stay of ilmenites in the depositional basin.
   Ilmenites from these fossil strandlines must have been reworked by the
   present day coastal processes and deposited in favorable bay-like NE-SW
   coastal configurations in Kanyakumari-Kuttankuli and Kallar-Vaippar
   regions under high energy wave conditions. The present study has
   disclosed the enrichment of ilmenites up to 1m in depth in the above two
   zones which can be commercially exploited. The present study also calls
   for confirming part of the lost continent called Lemuria or Eastern
   Gondwana by systematic scientific investigations.},

Abstract = {In an attempt to characterize more fully the variation in substrate
   reaction forces in the locomotor repertoire of primates, we recorded the
   forces involved in directional changes for two species. These are the
   first records of turning forces for vertebrate quadrupeds, much less
   primates. Three ring-tailed lemurs and two patas monkeys performed turns
   of approximately 30 degrees as they crossed a force platform. The
   ring-tailed lemurs also turned on a horizontal branch-like support with
   a segment attached to the force transducer. Mediolateral forces of up to
   40\% body weight were recorded. These are considerably higher than
   during linear locomotion. Pivot limbs in ground turns and turns on the
   branch differed in the lemurs, suggesting that substrate influences
   turning strategies. Limbs encountered both medial and lateral reaction
   forces, and as a result, they may be exposed to variable bending regimes
   in the frontal plane. The stereotypy in bending regimes suggested by in
   vivo bone strain studies, therefore, may characterize linear locomotion
   only. The lemurs showed hindlimb dominance in turns, both in terms of
   frequency used as well as force magnitude (hindlimb steering). Hindlimb
   dominance in weight support characterizes both species (and primates in
   general), but it is more pronounced in the lemurs. In the patas monkeys,
   forces were more evenly distributed among the two pairs of limbs. The
   mediolateral turning forces therefore seem to track the amount of weight
   to be shifted sideways. Overall variance in mediolateral forces was
   greater in the arboreal and versatile lemurs than in the terrestrial and
   cursorial patas monkeys.},

Abstract = {Madagascar has a distinctive fruit bar community consisting of Pteropus

   we observed fruit bat visits to flowering baobabs (Adansonia suarezensis

   austral winter. Eidolon dupreanum was recorded feeding on the nectar of
   baobabs and kapok, P rufus was observed Feeding oil kapok only and no R.
   madagascariensis were seen. Three mammals species, two small lemurs
   (Phaner furcifer and Mirza coquereli) and E. dupreanum, made
   nondestructive visits to flowering A. grandidieri and are therefore all
   potential pollinators of this endangered baobab. This is the first
   evidence to show that A. grandidieri is bit-pollinated and Further
   demonstrates the close link between fruit bats and some of Madagascars
   endemic plants. Eidolon dupreanum was the only mammal species recorded
   visiting A. suarezensis and visits peaked at the reported limes of
   maximum nectar concentration. Pteropus rufus visited kapok mostly before
   midnight when most nectar was available, but E. dupreanum visited later
   in the night. These differences in timing of foraging on kapok can be
   explained either by differing distances from the roost sites of each
   species or by resource partitioning. We advocate increased levels of
   protection, education awareness, and applied research oil both
   mammal-pollinated baobab species and fruit bats, and suggest that both
   baobabs and bats are candidate ``flagship species{''} for the threatened

Title = {Reconciling the origins of Africa, India and Madagascar with vertebrate
   dispersal scenarios},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {77},
Number = {6},
Pages = {399-418},
Abstract = {Africa, India and Madagascar were once part of the supercontinent of
   Gondwana. This land mass began to fragment approx. 170 million years
   ago, and by 83 million years, all of the major components we recognize
   today were separated by tracts of water. Madagascar's fossil record and
   estimates of the timing of the extant vertebrate radiations in
   Madagascar are not easily reconciled with this history of fragmentation.
   Fossil faunas that lived prior to approx. 65 million years had a
   cosmopolitan flavour, but this was lost after the Cretaceous-Tertiary
   boundary. Phylogenetic reconstructions of most extant Malagasy
   vertebrate radiations indicate divergence times that postdate the
   End-Cretaceous (lemurs, tenrecs, cichlid fish) and even the Early
   Miocene (chameleons, carnivores, rodents). Most biogeographic
   explanations of these groups rely, therefore, on Simpson's model of
   sweepstakes dispersal (see also cover figure), but there are significant
   problems in applying the model to migrations from Africa to Madagascar,
   although its application is not so intractable between India and
   Madagascar. Alternative migration routes for consideration lie: (1)
   along the suite of fracture zones between Antarctica and
   Africa/Madagascar (known as the Antarctic-Africa Corridor), which may
   have been exposed episodically above sea level; (2) along a series of
   submerged basaltic ridges/plateaus with known or suspected continental
   crust between Antarctica and Africa/Madagascar/ India flanking the
   Antarctic-Africa Corridor (e.g. the Madagascar Ridge, Mozambique Ridge,
   Conrad Plateau, Gunnerus Ridge); (3) between Africa and Madagascar along
   the Davie Ridge (parts of which are known to have been exposed
   episodically above sea level); (4) along the Deccan hotspot corridor
   between India and greater Africa. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {Primates tend to be long-lived, and, except for humans, most primate
   females are able to reproduce into old age. Although aging in most
   mammals is accompanied by dental senescence due to advanced wear,
   primates have low-crowned teeth that wear down before old age. Because
   tooth wear alters crown features gradually, testing whether early dental
   senescence causes reproductive senescence has been difficult. To
   identify whether and when low-crowned teeth compromise reproductive
   success, we used a 20-year field study of Propithecus edwardsi, a
   rainforest lemur from Madagascar with a maximum lifespan of >27 years.
   We analyzed tooth wear in three dimensions with dental topographic
   analysis by using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology. We
   report that tooth wear exposes compensatory shearing blades that
   maintain dental function for 18 years. Beyond this age, female fertility
   remains high; however infants survive only if lactation seasons have
   elevated rainfall. Therefore, low-crowned teeth accommodate wear to a
   point, after which reproductive success closely tracks environmental
   fluctuations. These results suggest a tooth wear-determined, but
   rainfall-mediated, onset of reproductive senescence. Additionally, our
   study indicates that even subtle changes in climate may affect
   reproductive success of rainforest species.},

Abstract = {Participatory ecological monitoring is a realistic and effective
   approach in wetlands such as Alaotra, Madagascar, where important
   biodiversity is found in an area with high human population density.
   Since 2001, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, government technical
   services, regional non-governmental organisations and local communities
   have collected data on key species, such as waterbirds, a locally
   endemic lemur and useful natural resources. The monitoring was linked
   with environmental quizzes and an inter-village competition, which
   helped raise interest in the monitoring and publicise results. The
   monitoring has assisted wetland management by guiding amendments to and
   increasing respect for the regional fishing convention, raising
   awareness, catalysing marsh management transfer to communities and
   stimulating collaboration and good governance. The sustainability of the
   monitoring scheme and the usefulness of the data for detecting trends
   and guiding local managements are discussed.},

Title = {Intrasexual selection in Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {48},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Studies of sexual selection show that both female choice and male-male
   competition can influence the evolution and expression of male
   phenotypes. In this regard, it is important to determine the functional
   basis through which male traits influence variation in male reproductive
   success. In this study, we estimate the strength and type of sexual
   selection acting on adult males in a population of wild lemur,
   Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi). The data used in
   this study were collected at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, southwest
   Madagascar. We conducted paternity analyses on 70 males in order to
   estimate the distribution of reproductive success in this population.
   Paternity data were combined with morphometric data in order to
   determine which morphological traits covary with male fitness. Five
   morphological traits were defined in this analysis: body size, canine
   size, torso shape, arm shape, and leg shape. We utilized phenotypic
   selection models in order to determine the strength and type of
   selection acting directly on each trait. Our results show that
   directional selection acts on leg shape (a trait that is functionally
   related to locomotor performance), stabilizing selection acts on body
   mass and torso shape, and negative correlational selection acts on body
   mass and leg shape. We draw from biomechanical and kinematic studies of
   sifaka locomotion to provide a functional context for how these traits
   influence male mating competition within an arboreal environment.
   Verreaux's sifaka and many other gregarious lemurs are sexually
   monomorphic in body mass and canine size, despite a high frequency and
   intensity of male-male aggressive competition. Our results provide some
   insight into this paradox: in our population, there is no directional
   selection acting on body mass or canine size in males. The total pattern
   of selection implicates that behaviors relating to locomotor performance
   are more important than behaviors relating to fighting ability during
   intrasexual contests. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Fruit and seed characteristics are compared between a dry deciduous
   forest in the west and a humid littoral forest in the south-east of
   Madagascar to discriminate between the role of abiotic factors
   (humidity, climate, soil characteristics) and frugivorous vertebrates
   for the evolution of morphological and biochemical fruit
   characteristics. The sites differed in abiotic conditions but contain
   very similar communities of frugivorous vertebrates. Fruit selection by
   two lemur species (Eulemur fulvus and Cheirogaleus medius) that are
   important for seed dispersal and that are present at both study sites,
   was compared between sites to examine fixed selection criteria that
   could give rise to possible co-evolution between frugivores and their
   fruit species on the one hand or to dietary flexibility of the
   frugivores on the other hand. Our results show that most fruit
   characteristics differ significantly between study sites. Food selection
   by both lemur genera in relation to morphological and biochemical fruit
   characteristics co-varies closely with their representation at a given
   site. These results indicate that morphological and biochemical
   characteristics are more likely the result of abiotic conditions rather
   than of interactions between frugivorous lemurs and their food.},

Volume = {76},

Abstract = {The aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) is easily the most enigmatic
   of living primates. It sports a unique combination of derived
   characters, including continuously growing incisors, functional claws,
   the largest hand of any primate and a highly modified middle finger. The
   specialised middle finger is no longer used in locomotion and serves as
   a probe-like instrument for investigating, locating and extracting
   xylophagous (wood-boring) larvae as well as other food items. Its
   phalanges can be moved both at great speed and independently of each
   other. The present study reports on dissections of the forelimbs of two
   individuals of D. madagascariensis and one specimen each of Lemur catta
   and Cercopithecus cephus. Derived characters of the forelimb musculature
   in Daubentonia are interpreted within the context of its distinct
   locomotor and foraging adaptations. The primary adaptations underlying
   speed and mobility in the third manual digit of Daubentonia are found in
   the intrinsic hand musculature and notably in the arrangement of the
   dorsal aponeurosis. Implications for the interpretation of suggested
   convergences between the aye-aye, the diprotodont marsupial Dactylopsila
   palpator and the early Tertiary apatemyid genus Heterohyus are
   discussed. Copyright (c) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

Abstract = {Comparative studies of mammalian eye morphology have shown that relative
   cornea size is an important correlate of visual ecology. Nocturnal
   species tend to have large corneas relative to eye size as an adaptation
   for increasing visual sensitivity. By contrast, diurnal species tend to
   have smaller corneas relative to eye size because their eye morphology
   maximizes visual acuity. Although qualitative analyses suggest that
   activity pattern may have a similar influence on eye morphology in
   primates, various current hypotheses have proposed that either diurnal
   anthropoids or diurnal lemurs have visual systems that diverge from
   those of other diurnal mammals. The goal of this analysis is to quantify
   the relationship between eye morphology and activity pattern in primates
   and to determine whether primates exhibit variation in eye morphology
   comparable to that of other mammals. Data on eye size and cornea size
   were collected for 147 specimens of 55 primate species. These data
   reveal that, within primate suborders, diurnal species have
   significantly smaller relative cornea sizes than nocturnal or cathemeral
   species. Both haplorhines and strepsirrhines thus exhibit variation in
   eye morphology that is consistent with functional expectations. However,
   comparisons between the two primate suborders demonstrate that
   haplorhines and strepsirrhines differ significantly in eye morphology.
   Whereas strepsirrhines have relative cornea sizes that are similar to
   nonprimate mammals of comparable activity pattern, diurnal anthropoids
   have smaller relative cornea sizes than most nonprimate mammals. This
   derived eye morphology in anthropoids probably evolved in the anthropoid
   stem lineage as a result of selection for highly acute diurnal vision.

Abstract = {Prosimian lemurs differ fundamentally from anthropoid primates in many
   traits related to social structure. By exploring the demography of
   Milne-Edwards' sifakas (Propithecus diadema edwardsi), and comparing it
   to other well-studied primates, we explore the effect of demographic and
   life-history factors on social structure. Specifically, we compare lemur
   survivorship and fertility patterns to two published composite models:
   one created for New World and another created for Old World monkeys.
   Using longitudinal data collected on individual Propithecus diadema
   edwardsi from four study groups from 1986-2000 in Ranomafana National
   Park, Madagascar, we quantify 1) group composition, 2) birth
   seasonality, 3) interbirth interval, 4) life-table values, and 5)
   population growth estimates. The mortality, survivorship, and
   life-expectancy schedules indicate high infant and juvenile mortality.
   Fertility remains high until death. The intrinsic rate of increase and
   net reproductive rate indicate a shrinking population. We suggest that
   high mortality rather than low fertility causes the observed population
   decline. While sifaka survivorship closely resembles New World patterns,
   fertility resembles Old World patterns, i.e., like New World monkeys,
   few sifakas survive to reproductive age, and those that do, reproduce at
   a slow rate resembling the Old World pattern. This necessarily impacts
   social stricture. An adult sifaka at the end of her lifespan will have
   one only daughter who survives to reproductive age, compared to 3.4 for
   New World or 2.7 for Old World monkeys. Demography limits the formation
   of large kin-based groups for sifakas, and survivorship and fertility
   patterns do not easily permit sifakas to form large same-sex family
   groups. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {A database has been assembled with 278 age determinations for
   Madagascar. Materials C-14 dated include pretreated sediments and plant
   macrofossils from cores and excavations throughout the island, and
   bones, teeth, or eggshells of most of the extinct megafaunal taxa,
   including the giant lemurs, hippopotami, and ratites. Additional
   measurements come from uranium-series dates on speleothems and
   thermoluminescence dating of pottery.
   Changes documented include late Pleistocene climatic events and, in the
   late Holocene, the apparently human-caused transformation of the
   environment. Multiple lines of evidence point to the earliest human
   presence at ca. 2300 C-14 yr BP (350 cal yr BC). A decline in megafauna,
   inferred from a drastic decrease in spores of the coprophilous fungus
   Sporormiella spp. in sediments at 1720 +/- 40 C-14 yr BP (230-410 cal yr
   AD), is followed by large increases in charcoal particles in sediment
   cores, beginning in the SW part of the island, and spreading to other
   coasts and the interior over the next millennium. The record of human
   occupation is initially sparse, but shows large human populations
   throughout the island by the be-inning of the Second Millennium AD.
   Dating of the ``subfossil{''} megafauna, including pygmy hippos,
   elephant birds, giant tortoises, and large lemurs, demonstrates that
   most if not all the extinct taxa were still present on the island when
   humans arrived. Many taxa overlapped chronologically with humans for a
   millennium or more. The extinct lemurs Hadropithecus stenognathus,
   Pachylemur insignis, Mesopropithecus pithecoides, and Daubentonia
   robusta, and the elephant birds Aepyornis spp. and Mullerornis spp.,
   were still present near the end of the First Millennium AD.
   Palaeopropithecus ingens, Megaladapis edwardsi, and Archaeolemur sp.
   (cf. edwardsi) may have survived until the middle of the Second
   Millennium A.D. One specimen of Hippopotamus of unknown provenance dates
   to the period of European colonization. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Dietary patterns in Perrier's sifakas (Propithecus diadema perrieri): A

Abstract = {Some lemur species range into only one habitat type, whereas others
   range into a variety of habitats. Because plant community structure can
   differ between habitats, dietary patterns may vary for conspecific
   groups of primates that range into more than one type of habitat. The
   goal of our study was to determine how habitat variation influences
   dietary patterns in Perrier's sifakas (Propithecus diadema perrieri)
   that range into both dry and riparian forests in northern Madagascar. We
   collected 542 hr of data on the behavior and diet of two groups of P.d.
   perrieri from 7 June to 4 August 1998 at Camp Antobiratsy in Analamera
   Special Reserve, Madagascar. We computed indices of dietary diversity
   for each group and dietary/plant species similarity between groups. P.d.
   perrieri in group I fed predominantly in dry forest (72.7\% of feeding
   records, n = 660), whereas those in group 2 fed most often in riparian
   forest (73.7\% of feeding records, n = 666). The index of dietary
   similarity (0.986) was significantly higher than the index of plant
   species similarity (0.767). Although the P.d. perrieri in the two study
   groups fed predominantly in different forest habitats, they ate similar
   food items in very comparable proportions (but not from the same plant
   species). However, based on habitat availability measures, neither group
   fed where they were expected to feed. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {75},
Number = {4},
Pages = {279-293},
Abstract = {Accelerometry data were transmitted by a radio collar attached to a
   hand-reared red-ruffed lemur housed in a large indoor/outdoor enclosure
   at Chester Zoo. An observer simultaneously recorded locomotor behaviour
   using a manually operated event recorder. Both data streams were
   recorded directly to hard disk to ensure accurate synchrony. Leaps were
   modelled using a y = x(2) - x(3) formulation for the take-off
   acceleration, to link peak acceleration to leap distance. Cyclic
   locomotor modes were analysed using power spectra and the modal
   frequency used to estimate stride periodicity. Comparison of the dual
   data shows that leaping behaviour can be recorded reliably, and
   acceleration magnitude provides accurate predictions of the distance
   travelled. Cyclic activities were less well characterised, but
   calibration should permit travel distance estimations equalling or
   bettering those from conventional techniques. Copyright (C) 2004 S.

Abstract = {Gene flow within and between social groups is contingent on
   behaviourally mediated patterns of mating and dispersal. To understand
   how these patterns affect the genetic structure of primate populations,
   long-term data are required. In this study, we analyse 10 years of
   demographic and genetic data from a wild lemur population (Propithecus
   verreauxi verreauxi) at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, southwest
   Madagascar. Our goal is to specify how patterns of mating and dispersal
   determine kinship and genetic diversity among animals in the population.
   Specifically, we use microsatellite, parentage, and census data to
   obtain estimates of genetic subdivision (F-ST), within group
   homozygosity (F-IS), and relatedness W within and among social groups in
   the population. We analyse different classes of individuals (i.e.
   adults, offspring, males, females) separately in order to discern which
   classes most strongly influence aspects of population structure.
   Microsatellite data reveal that, across years, offspring are
   consistently more heterozygous than expected within social groups (F-IS
   mean = -0.068) while adults show both positive and negative deviations
   from expected genotypic frequencies within groups (F-IS mean = 0.003).
   Offspring cohorts are more genetically subdivided than adults (F-ST mean
   = 0.108 vs. 0.052) and adult females are more genetically subdivided
   than adult males (F-ST mean = 0.098 vs. 0.046). As the proportion of
   females in social groups increases, the proportion of offspring sired by
   resident males decreases. Offspring are characterized by a heterozygote
   excess as resident males (vs. nonresident males) sire the majority of
   offspring within groups. We link these genetic data to patterns of
   female philopatry, male dispersal, exogamy, and offspring sex-ratio.
   Overall, these data reveal how mating and dispersal tactics influence
   the genetic population structure in this species.},

   mammals},
Journal = {GENE},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {312},
Pages = {95-102},
Month = {JUL 17},
Abstract = {The terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, cytochrome c
   oxidase (COX), contains three mitochondrial and ten nuclear encoded
   subunits in mammals. Three of the nuclear subunits (VIa, VIIa, and VIII)
   have muscle and non-mu scle-specific isoforms, subunit IV contains a
   lung-specific isoform, and subunit VIb contains a testes-specific
   isoform. For subunit VIII, the smallest nuclear encoded COX polypeptide,
   we have now found a third gene (COX 8-3), which has been identified in
   human, lemur, rat, and mouse, suggesting that it is present in a broad
   range of Eutherian mammals. Sequence similarity and gene structure
   support the homology of COX8-3 to the other subunit VIII isoforms,
   indicating that all three are the product of gene duplications. COX
   VIII-3 protein is mitochondrially-targeted, as shown by a fluorescent
   COX VIII3/DsRed fusion protein. Both the mitochondrial targeting and its
   sequence conservation suggest that COXVIII-3 functions as part of the
   COX holoenzyme and could have a tissue-specific role, as is the case for
   the other two isoforms. Questions remain about where COX8-3 is
   predominantly expressed. However, detection of full-length cDNAs, lower
   levels of sequence divergence at the first and second codon positions
   compared to the third, and a conserved gene structure indicate that COX
   VIII-3 is an expressed gene whose origin dates to at least 91 million
   years ago. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Physical activity and balance performance were examined in gray mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus murinus) aging from 1 to 10 years of age. Home cage
   spontaneous activity, physical and behavioral activities in an
   open-field test and balance performance at the Rotarod test were
   evaluated. In this prosimian primate, which life span reaches 8-10 years
   in captivity, balance performance at the Rotarod test showed a clear
   decease with age. Latency to fall decreased from 154.7 +/- 13.5 s in the
   youngest group of animals to 31.2 +/- 5.4 s in animals aging 6 years or
   more. A significant decrease was noticeable as early as 4 years of age.
   In a familiar cage, locomotor activity and jumping frequency were
   reduced in aged animals compared to adults. In contrast, when introduced
   in an open field, aged animals exhibited an increase in locomotor
   activity and sniffing frequency when compared to younger animals, while
   latency to first movement was higher in the adult than in the aged
   subjects. Based on these results, repeated behavioral testing should be
   initiated early in the life of this species, in association with an
   evaluation of visual and olfactory capacities. These findings are
   important to take into account if detailed evaluations of sensory-motor
   performances are required in studies on aging processes in primates. (C)

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {123-130},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In humans, placental corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) production
   has been linked to the determination of gestational length, and a late
   gestational fall in CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP) has been linked to the
   onset of parturition. Expression of placental CRH mRNA is limited to
   primates, and only in man has a circulating CRH-BP been described. As
   the fall in CRH-BP in late gestation has been associated with
   parturition in humans, we sought to determine whether a CRH-BP
   circulated in the plasma of other primates. It is unclear whether
   maternal plasma CRH concentrations are elevated in New World monkeys and
   prosimians, We have therefore performed CRH plasma measurements in the
   blood of pregnant marmosets, in several species of lemur, and in
   pregnant and fetal rhesus monkeys as a positive control. Using gel
   chromatography, CRH-BP was detected in the human, gorilla, chimpanzee,
   orangutan, gibbon, macaque, squirrel monkey, and marmoset, but was
   absent in the mandrill, spider monkey, and lemur. CRH was detected in
   the plasma of pregnant marmosets and rhesus monkeys. CRH was also
   detected in the fetal rhesus monkey, but at lower concentrations than in
   maternal plasma. CRH immunoreactivity was not detectable in the plasma
   of pregnant lemurs or in extracts of lemur placenta. In conclusion, a
   circulating binding protein for CRH exists in all species of apes but
   occurs variably among New World and Old World monkeys and is absent in
   lemurs. The variable occurrence of the CRH-BP does not support a role
   for this protein in the mechanism of parturition in primates. Maternal
   CRH is elevated in the pregnant marmoset and rhesus, and may play a role
   in the pregnancy of New and Old World monkeys. (C) 2001 Wiley Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Employing comparative analysis of the cDNA-coding sequences of the
   unique preprorelaxin of the Afro-lorisiform Galago crassicaudatus and
   the Malagasy lemur Varecia variegata and the relaxin-like factor (RLF)
   of G. crassicaudatus, we demonstrated distinct differences in the
   dynamics of molecular remodeling of both hormones during primate
   evolution. The lorisiform and lemuriform preprorelaxin sequences encoded
   identical hormones, providing the first endocrinological evidence for
   the monophyletic origin of all Strepsirrhini. Structural analysis
   revealed the lemuriform members of the relaxin family to be potentially
   bioactive single-gene products. In contrast to the ``two-prong{''}
   relaxin receptor-binding motif (RELVR) present within the B-domains of
   other primate relaxins, strepsirrhine relaxin contained a unique
   ``three-prong{''} motif (RRLIR) with highest sequence homology to the
   receptor-binding motif of the evolutionarily much older skate relaxin.
   In contrast to relaxin, the RLF molecule was highly conserved during
   primate evolution and contained within its B-domain the putative relaxin
   receptor-binding motif and a pentameric sequence implicated in binding
   to specific RLF receptors. Mutually exclusive expression of
   strepsirrhine preprorelaxin and RLF were observed in the fetal villous
   trophoblast cells of the strepsirrhine placenta and postpubertal
   testicular Leydig cells, respectively, reflecting distinct functional
   roles for both hormones within the reproductive tract of Strepsirrhini.},

Title = {The the concept of nested species assemblages and its utility for
   understanding effects of habitat fragmentation},
Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-99},
Abstract = {The concept of nestedness represents a null model that measures the
   order in presence-absence matrices of species in different assemblages
   (Patterson \& Atmar 1986, 2000). Based on the assumptions of the model,
   consequences of fragmentation and the vulnerability of species to
   habitat change can be quantified. Different species assemblages are
   considered to be nested perfectly, if subsets of one or more species are
   lost at a time as communities decline in species number and none of the
   species lost from the richer communities reappears in one of the species
   poor communities once it was lost. Nestedness is most prevalent in
   habitat fragments (islands) derived from a once continuous system with a
   common species pool that became isolated. The presence-absence matrix of
   species at given sites can be ordered in a way to maximize regularity.
   Then, the order of sites and species reflects habitat suitability of the
   sites and the vulnerability of a given species to fragmentation. This
   concept of nestedness is illustrated and used
   1. to derive estimates of minimum viable populations of lemurs in forest
   fragments of Madagascar;
   2. to learn, at which size a forest fagment is perceived as ``forest{''}
   by Malagasy reptiles;
   3. to test whether the system of protected areas within the city of
   Hamburg represents a network for the local avifauna with species
   exchange or whether the single protected areas represent islands in the
   urban matrix;
   4. to link life history traits to the vulnerability of species to the
   urban environment and to develop hypotheses on the causes underlying the
   evolution of nested patterns. The analysis of the urban system revealed
   that the Protected areas within the city limits of Hamburg are perceived
   by birds as islands in an urban matrix. ``Green{''} links between the
   areas do not act as corridors that allow free movement of all species.
   The vulnerability of any given bird species to fragmentation of woodland
   habitat within the city depends on its ability to use the urban matrix
   between the protected areas and seems to be related to the investments
   in egg-shell material. Species with high requirements for egg-shells
   disappear earlier from the community. Analyses of nested patterns can
   provide insights in biodiversity processes and valuable recommendations
   for decision making where longterm data are not available. The main
   values of the analyses of nested patterns, however, is to develop
   hypotheses that can then be tested with more detailed studies.},

Abstract = {Eulemur macaco flavifrons, the Sclater's black lemur, is a critically
   endangered subspecies of northwest Madagascar, which is not yet
   protected by any reserve. In order to study the feasibility of creating
   such a reserve, an area of outstanding biological importance was
   selected in the region of Maromandia-Sahamalaza, which is probably the
   only remaining place which would permit the long-term survival of the
   Sclater's black lemur. To determine if genetic management is needed for
   the Sahamalaza black lemur population, its genetic variability was
   estimated with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers and
   compared with other populations. These comparisons demonstrate that the
   Sahamalaza black lemurs have a genetic variability equivalent to those
   in other areas. Thus, we conclude that no genetic management is required
   at the present time. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Craniodental functional morphology and taxonomy of dermopterans},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {81},
Number = {2},
Pages = {360-385},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Craniodental form and function were evaluated in the 2 extant,
   parapatric species of dermopterans (Dermoptera: Cynocephalidae). The
   level of morphological distinction between the 2 taxa was such that were
   they known as fossils; most taxonomists would not contest their
   genus-level distinction as indicative of adaptive differentiation. In
   fact, these taxa exemplify the widely employed but implicit
   morphological distance-based standards used for delineating mammalian
   genera in the paleontological literature. Appropriate names for these 2
   taxa are Cynocephalus volans for the Philippine flying lemur and
   Galeopterus variegatus for the heterogeneous populations of the Sundaic
   flying lemurs. Cynocephalus probably has a hypertrophied version of the
   ancestral cynocephalid molar complex and modified incisor and canine
   morphology. The hypertrophied metaconules of cynocephalids occlude with
   an expanded paracristid and a cusplike shelf, the distocuspid.
   Cynocephalus also has a broader rostrum, a greater degree of postorbital
   constriction, and enhanced ectocranial ridges associated with a more
   robust masticatory musculature than Galeopterus. Cynocephalus appears
   adapted to a diet that requires a greater degree of shearing by the
   anterior dentition and crushing by the molariform dentition. These
   anterior shearing teeth (13, C1, P3, c1, p3) are larger and more
   bladelike than those of Galeopterus, and the bite force is more
   anteriorly directed. Angle of the mandible is ventrally expanded in
   Cynocephalus, facilitating enhanced chewing force for the post canine
   dentition while maintaining orientation of the temporalis muscle.
   Dwarfed forms of Galeopterus are found on many of the smaller islands of
   the Sunda Shelf and in central Laos, They are not morphologically
   distinguishable from larger members of this species, other than in size,
   and do not warrant specific distinction. However, it may be desirable to
   designate 4 subspecies of G. variegatus: G. v. variegatus from Java, G.
   v. temminckii from Sumatra, G. v. borneanus from Borneo, and G. v.
   peninsulae from the Malay Peninsula and mainland Southeast Asia.
   Separate species rank for each of the dwarfed populations should not be
   recognized. Phylogenetic relationships of Dermoptera are discussed in
   light of the morphological differences of the 2 genera.},

Abstract = {A character-based phylogenetic species concept approach was used to
   examine conservation unit status for three wild populations of black and
   white ruffed lemurs, Varecia vareigata variegata, from Betampona (N =
   3), Manombo (N = 6), and Ranomafana (N = 14), Madagascar. Population
   aggregation analysis was performed on 548 bp from the control region
   (D-loop) of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Twenty-one diagnostic sites
   were found to differentiate the Betampona (northern) population from the
   Manombo/Ranomafana (southern) populations. Additionally, individuals
   from the North American captive population (N = 11) and from Parc
   Ivoloina, Madagascar (N = 6) were examined for the same mtDNA fragment.
   The captive animals more closely resembled the southern populations and
   the Parc Ivoloina animals were more similar to the northern population.
   However, the inclusion of these ex situ animals reduced the number of
   diagnostic sites differentiating the northern and southern populations.
   Our genetic data were used to assess the ongoing management strategy for
   reintroducing individuals into the Betampona population and for
   introducing new founders into the ex situ population. This study
   demonstrates the utility of combining genetic information with a
   consideration of conservation priorities in evaluating the
   implementation of management strategies.},

Title = {Time budgets and foraging in a Malagasy primate: do sex differences

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {311-322},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Female mammals commonly employ behavioral tactics of modulating activity
   levels and foraging behavior to counter the energetic burden of
   reproduction; these behavioral changes are reflected as intersexual
   differences. Traditional views of Malagasy primates posit that high
   reproductive costs select for female dominance which guarantees to
   energetically stressed females priority of resource access. I tested
   predictions regarding reproductive influences on sex differences in time
   budgets and foraging behavior using two groups of Milne-Edwards' sifaka
   (Propithecus diadema edwardsi) in southeastern Madagascar. Compared to
   males, females increased neither feeding nor resting time during
   gestation or lactation. Sex differences were essentially absent in all
   foraging time variables examined (time, duration, rate). In contrast,
   dietary composition diverged between the sexes in some months. The
   possibility that females selected particular food items to boost
   nutrient and energetic intake to meet increased requirements during
   reproduction must be further clarified with nutritional analyses. Sex
   differences in plant part choices coincided with lactation in one of the
   two study groups. Thus, the timing of sex differences in feeding
   patterns of P. d. edwardsi only partially supports the prediction that
   sex differences are most pronounced during the period of greatest female
   energetic demand. A comparative review indicated no tight association
   between female dominance and sex differences in foraging among Malagasy
   primates. Traditional female dominance theory falls short of explaining
   the observed patterns. The results of my study coupled with recent
   evidence suggest that nonbehavioral tactics involving energy
   conservation and storage require further attention as mechanisms by
   which female lemurs cope with reproductive costs.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Pages = {274-283},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The transition/transversion (ti/tv) rate ratios are estimated by
   pairwise sequence comparison and joint likelihood analysis using
   mitochondrial cytochrome b genes of 28 primate species, representing
   both the Strepsirrhini (lemurs and lories) and the Anthropoidea
   (monkeys, apes, and humans). Pairwise comparison reveals a strong
   negative correlation between estimates of the ti/tv ratio and the
   sequence distance, even when both are corrected for multiple
   substitutions. The maximum-likelihood estimate of the ti/tv ratio
   changes with the species included in the analysis. The ti/tv bias within
   the lemuriform taxa is found to be as strong as in the anthropoids, in
   contradiction to an earlier study which sampled only one lemuriform.
   Simulations show the surprising result that both the pairwise correction
   method and the joint likelihood analysis tend to overcorrect for
   multiple substitutions and overestimate the ti/tv ratio, especially at
   low sequence divergence. The bias, however, is not large enough to
   account for the observed patterns. Nucleotide frequency biases,
   variation of substitution rates among sites, and different evolutionary
   dynamics at the three codon positions can be ruled out as possible
   causes. The likelihood-ratio test suggests that the ti/tv rate ratios
   may be variable among evolutionary lineages. Without any biological
   evidence for such a variation, however. we are left with no plausible
   explanations for the observed patterns other than a possible saturation
   effect due to the unrealistic nature of the model assumed.},

Abstract = {In July and August 1995, the authors interviewed elderly Malagasy with
   knowledge of the traditions and natural history of their home areas,
   centered on the villages of Belo-sur-mer, Antsira, and Ambararata, on
   the southwest coast of Madagascar. Several individuals related personal
   experiences in which they claim to have seen and heard animals that do
   not match any known extant animal of Madagascar. Two of the mystery
   animals, known locally as the kilopilopitsofy and kidoky, were described
   in terms similar to creatures detailed in historical accounts and
   folklore recorded in Madagascar between the mid-1600s and the end of the
   nineteenth century. The former of these has been compared by some
   authors to the dwarf hippopotamus and the latter to a giant lemur,
   animals generally inferred from radiocarbon dating of last known
   occurrences to have gone extinct early in the present millennium or
   perhaps a few centuries later. Stories by these same informants
   concerning extant animals demonstrate their accurate knowledge of the
   fauna. Magical powers are ascribed to some animals, such as the
   bokyboky, a viverrid (Mungotictis) that occurs in the region.
   Radiocarbon dates obtained recently on some of the extinct megafauna,
   showing that some extirpated taxa may have survived until recent
   centuries, confirm that ethnographic sources of information on these
   species should not automatically be dismissed as irrelevant or
   unreliable.},

Abstract = {We collected data during a 10-month study carried out on the mongoose
   lemur, Eulemur mongoz, at Anjamena in northwestern Madagascar, which
   provide baseline information on seasonal variation in the ecology, home
   range use and some aspects of the behavior of two neighboring groups. We
   monitored group size of nine groups in the study area and assessed them
   for seasonal variation. We present additional information collected
   during short-term surveys in other areas before and during the study for
   comparison. The study groups were small family units, and changes in
   group size were limited to births and emigrations of sexually mature
   progeny. In spite of clear seasonal changes in climate and vegetation,
   there is no variation in grouping patterns, so it is not possible to
   correlate variation in group size with seasonal variation of ecological
   variables. Comparison with ecological data from other field studies on
   lemurids reveals differences in food resource distribution in western
   forests versus other types of Malagasy forest. This distribution of food
   resources may predict home range size in mixed frugivorous-folivorous
   lemurs. Small home ranges, mainly in the West, could be correlated with
   a uniform distribution of food resources. Finally, we suggest that the
   dry season in the West may not present flugivorous-folivorous femurs
   with major problems in finding an adequate food supply. This is
   supported by the lack of seasonal differences in ranging behavior of
   mongoose femurs.},

Abstract = {The main aim of this field study was to compare adult male and female
   grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) with respect to body size,
   seasonal changes in body mass, onset of reproductive activity and sex
   ratio of captured animals. M. murinus was studied in the dry deciduous
   forest of western Madagascar. The lemurs were trapped in
   capture/recapture sessions during the dry season of 1993 (August,
   September, October). In order to verify results of studies in captivity
   concerning body mass and rank order among males, distribution patterns
   and body mass of males and females were examined. The results of this
   study indicate that rank in males is related to body mass and testes
   size, rather than determined by body size. Heavier males occurred closer
   to females, possibly facilitating access to breeding opportunities.
   There was no sexual dimorphism in body size. Differences between the
   sexes in seasonal changes in body mass, and in numbers of each sex
   caught, indicate that males and females have different activity patterns
   during the dry period, when food availability is restricted.},

Abstract = {Continued survival of most animal species depends on population
   management and active protection. It is generally agreed that, in order
   to avoid extinction of endangered species, ex situ and in situ
   conservation must be developed in tandem. However, even though many
   recommendations have been put forward to promote the survival of captive
   populations, some rapidly become extinct due to loss of genetic
   diversity (drift effect). Genetic markers, such as random amplified
   polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, can be applied to rapid testing of many
   individuals. They also permit analysis of very small amounts of DNA,
   when small species such as mouse lemurs (Microcebus) are to be tested.
   Using RAPD markers, we compare genetic diversity in four captive groups
   of Microcebus murinus to that in a sample of 70 wild mouse lemurs.
   Following the principles of Mendelian inheritance, each amplified
   fragment of DNA may be considered as a `locus' (or an amplifying site).
   The series of bands amplified by a particular primer in any individual
   is referred to as the individual's `profile'. We tested 5 primers, or,
   in the above terms, we studied 98 different `loci'. Results showed that
   the captive groups had lost genetic information with respect to the wild
   sample. Among the four captive groups, the loss of genetic diversity
   varied according to their number of founders and/or the management of
   their captive reproduction. Our study of polymorphism permitted us to
   establish tools for the genetic management of captive breeding, and for
   the determination of paternity which frequently give better results than
   behavioural studies; and simulation of introductions or departures of
   individuals in one very monomorphic group permitted estimation of future
   increases in its genetic diversity.},

Title = {Unusual nature and possible evolutionary implications of the male
   vesicular gland secretion in the tree shrew, Tupaia glis},
Journal = {ANATOMICAL RECORD},

Abstract = {Background: Whereas the secretion of the male vesicular gland in most
   mammals is amorphous, that of the tree shrew, Tupaia glis, was observed
   to be stored as globules.
   Methods: Vesicular and prostate glands from Tupaia, fixed in
   glutaraldehyde and osmium, were studied in the light and electron
   microscopes. Other materials considered included the Tupaia ejaculate
   produced by electroejaculation and, for comparative purposes, sections
   of the vesicular gland from a dermopteran, the flying lemur.
   Results: The vesicular gland epithelium in Tupaia secretes small
   granular aggregates and occasionally a denser aggregate that is
   associated with cells having obvious apical Golgi lamellae. In the
   alveolar lumen, these aggregates unite with others to form,
   respectively, granular and some dense globules of up to approximately 15
   Ir in diameter, which appear as such in semen produced by
   electroejaculation. In contrast to the prostate, however, precursor
   secretion vesicles were rare in the vesicular epithelium. Although
   poorly fixed, the vesicular gland secretion from a flying lemur also
   appeared to form globules.
   Conclusions: Although it is unlike the homogeneous secretion elaborated
   in most mammals, including primates and insectivores, the globular
   product of the Tupaia vesicular gland seems comparable to that in a
   variety of mega- and microbats, among representative species of which it
   appears to provide the bulk material for the vaginal copulation plug.
   Because a museum specimen examined here also indicates its occurrence in
   a flying lemur, the globular vesicular gland secretion common to
   Tupaiidae, to at least some Mega- and Microchiroptera, and apparently to
   Dermoptera may provide a soft tissue feature of some value in the
   cladistic approach to phylogenetic reconstruction within the Archonta.

Title = {Targets, tactics, and the open mouth face during play fighting in three
   species of primates},
Journal = {AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-57},
Abstract = {The play fighting of many mammals involves the nonserious use of
   behavior patterns derived from serious fighting. A major question of
   theoretical importance has been that of holy, given this overlap in
   patterns of behavior, the animals can distinguish between playful and
   nonplayful intent. One proposed solution is that animals use play
   signals to inform each other about the playful intent of their actions.
   The most widely reported play signal amongst primates is the open mouth
   play face. The manner in which this so-called signal functions is based
   on correlational evidence, with most reports simply noting its presence
   or absence in a given species. This study involved a detailed
   video-based analysis of the occurrence of open mouths during the play
   fighting of three species of primates. One captive troop each of
   ring-tailed lemurs, black-handed spider monkeys, and patas monkeys was
   used. By examining all open mouths in the context of the species-typical
   style of play fighting, several conclusions were empirically verified.
   1) Most open mouths occur as a functionally necessary precursor for
   biting. 2) Some open mouths occur as a defensive threat which deters
   further contact. 3) The residual open mouths which may function as
   contact promoting play signals, constituted about 20-25\% of all open
   mouths by the lemurs and patas monkeys, but less than 5\% for spider
   monkeys. These species differences appeared to arise from two causes.
   Firstly, the spider monkeys used another signal, the head shake, in
   situations where lemurs and patas monkeys used open mouths. Secondly,
   the style of play fighting greatly influenced the frequency and duration
   of open mouths. This was most marked in the face-to-face combat style of
   patas monkeys. These findings show that comparative studies of the
   occurrence and function of play signals need to take into account
   species-typical styles of playful combat. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss Inc.},

Abstract = {Recent redescriptions of most members of the Oxyuridae Cobbold, 1864
   parasitic in primates revealed that they share following derived
   characters: sexual dimorphism of lateral alae (single-crested in the
   males, double-crested in the females); in males a second pair of genital
   papillae always surrounded by strongly cuticularized rings; in females,
   uterine tube divided into 2 parts by a cellular wall forming a
   diaphragm. These characters are interpreted as synapomorphies, providing
   evidence that these taxa represent a monophyletic group, and we propose
   to classify them in a new subfamily of the Oxyuridae: the Enterobiinae
   subfam. nov. The Enterobiinae as recognized herein occurs in both Old
   World and New World Primates and rodents of the family Sciuridae (tribe
   Sciurini in the Holarctic region and tribe Xerini in the Ethiopian
   region). The new subfamily includes the following genera: Enterobius
   Leach, 1853; Colobenterobius Quentin, Betterton \& Krishnasamy, 1979;
   Rodentoxyuris Quentin \& Tenora 1974; Xeroxguris Hugot, 1995; Lemuricola

   Chabaud, Brygoo \& Fetter, 1965; Trypanoxyuris Vevers, 1923;
   Hapaloxyuris Inglis \& Cosgrove, 1965 and Paraoxyuronema Artigas, 1936.
   The genus Paraoxyuronema is revalidated as a subgenus of Trypanoxyuris
   due to its very specialized buccal structures. This genus groups all
   pinworm nematodes specific for primates of the family Atelidae,
   including: P. brachytelesi Artigas, 1937 occurring in Brachyteles
   arachmoides; P. atelis (Cameron, 1929) occurring in Ateles spp., and P.
   duplicidens (Buckley, 1931) and P. lagothricis (Buckley, 1931), which
   are parasites of Lagothrix spp. Inglisoxyuris inglisi Chabaud, Fetter \&
   Golvan, 1961, included in the monospecific genus Inglisoxyuris and
   previously classified as a subgenus of the Lemuricola, does not share
   the characters of the new subfamily and, until its precise
   classification can be considered with more information, it is proposed
   to refer to this species as an Oxyuridae sensu late. A diagnosis and a
   key of the genera included in the new subfamily are given.},

Abstract = {I review literature on juvenile mortality of captive prosimians in order
   to evaluate the available information on captive breeding. Juvenile
   mortality includes abortion, premature mortality stillbirth, and death
   of the unweaned young. Prosimian juvenile mortality ranges between 25
   and 45\% in captive populations. It is generally lower in the
   Lemuroidea, particularly the Cheirogaleidae, than in the Lorisoidea.
   Mortality is particularly high in the Lorisinae. Most mortality,
   including a high stillbirth rate, occurs on the first day and during the
   first 10 days thereafter Stress, maternal neglect and traumatic insults,
   not infrequently linked to each other, are the most frequently reported
   causes of death. The percentage of congenital malformations tends to be
   high in some colonies. Sex of the infant and parity seem to be important
   risk factors for juvenile mortality whereas litter size does not appear
   to be important Based on few data, wild-caught females appeal to have
   higher breeding success than those born in captivity Synchronized births
   in lemuroids and isolated births in Galago are more likely to result in
   successfully weaned infants.},

Year = {1994},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63-76},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ontogenetic changes in the morphology of the mandibular symphysis are
   described in Archaeolemur so as to infer the functional significance of
   symphyseal fusion in this subfossil Malagasy lemur. The first regions of
   the symphysis to show a more complex morphology were the lower and
   anterior borders of the joint and, to a lesser extent, the lingual
   borders of the superior and inferior transverse tori. During growth,
   these regions became increasingly rugose and encroached upon a centrally
   located, smooth, `'oval'' region, which may have been a principal
   pathway for neurovascular structures communicating with the unfused
   joint. In subadults, the symphysis was completely fused except for the
   lingual surface of the inferior transverse torus, where a patent suture
   and potential space were present between dentaries. Thus, in
   Archaeolemur there was an age- and size-related pattern of increased
   symphyseal ossification or fusion that was complete by adulthood.
   The morphology of the interlocking bony processes and the sequence of
   ossification in the symphysis suggest that increased dorsoventral shear
   stress during mastication was the most likely determinant of symphyseal
   fusion in Archaeolemur. The allometric pattern of greater symphyseal
   fusion may be linked to the presence of relatively greater dorsoventral
   shear in adults due to an increased recruitment of balancing-side
   jaw-muscle force. There is little indication that the symphysis of
   juvenile Archaeolemur was buttressed to resist forces associated with
   `'wishboning'' during mastication or vertical bending during incision.
   Our observations, as well as those of others, suggest that symphyseal
   fusion in primates occurs initially as a response to increased
   dorsoventral shear during mastication, Therefore, wishboning stress
   might only become a major determinant of symphyseal form and function in
   those taxa that develop a fused symphysis to counter increased
   dorsoventral shear. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Ambohitantely Special Reserve protects one of the few remaining remnants
   of native forest on the Central Plateau of Madagascar, yet its fauna is
   poorly studied. This paper describes the first systematic small mammal
   trapping programme to be implemented in the reserve. Between August 1988
   and March 1990, Sherman and pitfall traps revealed the presence of four
   endemic tenrec species and an introduced rat. Diurnal and nocturnal
   surveys recorded three lemur species. The terrestrial mammal community
   of Ambohitantely is compared with other reserves in Madagascar. It is
   concluded that the reserve has a relatively species-poor mammal fauna
   which may be due to its isolation from contiguous forest blocks. It is
   postulated that the continued presence of wild boar and domestic cattle
   in the reserve and regular burning of the surrounding savannah have a
   detrimental effect on the native fauna and flora. The consequences for
   conservation are discussed},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the process of mating among captive aye-ayes
   (Daubentonia madagascariensis). Data on sexual behaviour of 3
   wild-caught aye-ayes were collected over a period of 3 years
   (1986-1989). The group of 2 adult females and a young male was housed at
   the Vincennes Zoo, Paris. The seasonal poly-oestrous sexual cycle was
   found to be marked by four clear phases of the females' vulval
   tumescence and coincided with sexual interest shown by both sexes. The
   external genitalia of the females are described, as are marking
   behaviour and sexual behaviour patterns before, during and after
   copulation. The behaviour and sexual cycles of these 2 females were
   compared with records from other lemurs.},

Abstract = {Several potential measures of dyadic social dominance among captive
   aye-ayes, housed in male-female pairs, were taken for an initial
   description of the social relations. Results suggest that female
   aye-ayes may demonstrate priority in social as well as feeding contexts,
   thus conforming to a social pattern that is characteristic of several
   other Lemuriformes but uncommon among other primates. However, the
   observed precedence of females was not complete or unambiguous.
   Intensive naturalistic study is needed to confirm these observations and
   to clarify the conditions under which this system has evolved among the
   lemuriform primates.},

Title = {Relationships between endogenous circadian period, physiological and

Abstract = {The biological clock generates circadian rhythms, with an endogenous
   period tau close to 24 h. The circadian resonance theory proposes that
   lifespan is reduced when endogenous period goes far from 24 h. It has
   been suggested that daily resetting of the circadian clock to the 24 h
   external photoperiod might induce marginal costs that would accumulate
   over time and forward accelerate aging and affect fitness. In this
   study, we aimed to evaluate the link between the endogenous period and
   biomarkers of aging in order to investigate the mechanisms of the
   circadian resonance theory. We studied 39 middle-aged and aged
   Microcebus murinus, a nocturnal non-human primate whose endogenous
   period is about 23.1 h, measuring the endogenous period of locomotor
   activity, as well as several physiological and behavioral parameters
   (rhythm fragmentation and amplitude, energetic expenditure, oxidative
   stress, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentrations and
   cognitive performances) in both males and females. We found that aged
   males with tau far from 24 h displayed increased oxidative stress. We
   also demonstrated a positive correlation between tau and IGF-1
   concentrations, as well as learning performances, in males and females.
   Together these results suggest that a great deviation of tau from 24 h
   leads to increased biomarkers of age-related impairments.},

Title = {Chylopericardium Effusion in a Lac Alaotra Bamboo Lemur (Hapalemur
   alaotrensis)},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Simple Summary
   The clinical staff of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University
   of Milan in Lodi have worked closely with veterinarians operating in a
   famous zoological park in Northern Italy. Thanks to this collaboration
   it has been possible to properly manage the clinical case reported in
   this brief communication. In veterinary medicine, clinical cases of
   chylopericardium in the species Hapalemur alaotrensis have never been
   described in the literature. Even in more common species, such as dogs
   and cats, it is a very rare pathology. The description of this clinical
   case and its diagnostic management can be a valid clinical and
   anatomopathological support for other colleagues who face a similar
   case, so that they can focus on diagnostic investigations useful for
   diagnosis. A new anesthesiologic protocol, allowing the optimal
   management of the patient throughout the clinical procedure, is also
   reported in detail, as well as the detailed description of the lymphoCT
   examination. For all these reasons the authors think that the
   description of this clinical case can help other colleagues in the
   management of infested subjects.
   An 11-year-old female Hapalemur alaotrensis was evaluated following a
   history of dyspnea of 15 days' duration. Thoracic radiography performed
   by the referring veterinarian revealed a large cardiac silhouette and
   dorsal deviation of the trachea. Heart sounds were muffled.
   Echocardiographic findings were indicative of severe pericardial
   effusion without cardiac tamponade. No pleural effusion was identified.
   A computed tomography (CT) exam confirmed the presence of severe
   pericardial effusion and allowed identification of a parenchymatous
   mediastinal lesion sited at the level of the left hemithorax. To
   delineate the thoracic duct, lymphoCT was also performed by injection of
   iodinated contrast medium in the perianal subcutaneous tissue.
   Pericardiocentesis yielded a considerable amount of effusion with
   chylous biochemical and cytological properties. A diagnosis of
   chylopericardium with absence of pleural effusion was made. Initially,
   the chylopericardium was managed conservatively with two centesis and
   oral treatment with prednisolone. Medical treatment did not result in
   complete resolution of effusion and clinical signs; therefore, subtotal
   pericardiectomy and thoracic duct ligation were recommended. After the
   second pericardiocentesis, the subject died and the pericardiectomy
   could not be performed. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first
   report of the development of chylopericardium in a Hapalemur
   alaotrensis.},

Abstract = {As an oncogenic kinase in multiple cancers, LMTK3 was deeply implicated
   in cancer pathogenesis. Nevertheless, its biological function in
   colorectal cancer (CRC) is still unclear. In this study, LMTK3 mRNA
   expression was assessed by RT-qPCR. LMTK3, phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2),
   ERK1/2, and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels were detected by western
   blotting. Cetuximab (CTX)-resistant CRC cell models were constructed to
   investigate the mechanism of LMTK3-regulated CTX resistance in CRC. CTX
   half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), viability, apoptosis, cell
   cycle, migration, and invasion of CRC cells were analyzed via Cell
   Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, wound healing, and transwell
   assays. We found LMTK3 was distinctly upregulated in CRC tissues and
   cells, particularly in CTX-resistant CRC tissues and cells. LMTK3
   inhibition lowered CTX half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
   value, inhibited cell viability, induced cell apoptosis, triggered
   cell-cycle arrest, and impaired cell metastatic capability in
   CTX-resistant CRC cells. Moreover, we also demonstrated that LMTK3
   induced CTX resistance in CRC via the activation of ERK/MAPK signaling
   in vitro. These results suggested a novel molecular mechanism by which
   LMTK3 participates in the development of CTX resistance in CRC.},

Title = {Back to basics: Gaps in baseline data call for revisiting an
   environmental education program in the SAVA region, Madagascar},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {Environmental education programs are critically important for raising
   awareness about global and local environmental concerns, by providing
   the knowledge, tools, and means for young and old generations to cope
   with current challenges. Of the greatest importance is the
   implementation of environmental education programs in biodiversity
   hotspots where environmental crises are high and resources to fund
   mitigation programs are low. Madagascar is one such priority hotspot,
   featuring intensive wildlife-human conflicts due to shrinking natural
   environments. The Duke Lemur Center-SAVA Conservation Initiative has
   been conducting environmental education activities in the SAVA region,
   northeastern Madagascar, since 2011. These activities have been aimed at
   increasing awareness of local and global environmental issues and at
   stimulating the involvement of local school students. Our initiatives
   have predominantly supported teacher trainings to provide teachers with
   environmental education content, examples, and recommendations on how to
   integrate activities into their regular curricula, commonly referred to
   as a ``cascade approach{''}. Due to logistical hurdles, including high
   teacher turnover rates, however, these interventions have not been
   monitored to assess their efficacy. Thus, to better inform current and
   future interventions, we designed and implemented classroom-based
   surveys to gather baseline data on the basic knowledge of SAVA students
   and their perceptions of the environment. We identify informational gaps
   in surveyed schools, including those located in large towns vs.
   villages, and those with trained vs. untrained teachers. Based on these
   results, we make recommendations for future environmental education
   efforts in the region, including activities that could address real-life
   environmental problems and decision-making solutions.},

Title = {A role for gut microbiota in host niche differentiation},

Abstract = {If gut microbes influence host behavioral ecology in the short term,
   over evolutionary time, they could drive host niche differentiation. We
   explored this possibility by comparing the gut microbiota of
   Madagascar's folivorous lemurs from Indriidae and Lepilemuridae.
   Occurring sympatrically in the eastern rainforest, our four, target
   species have different dietary specializations, including frugo-folivory
   (sifakas), young-leaf folivory (indri and woolly lemurs), and
   mature-leaf folivory (sportive lemurs). We collected fecal samples, from
   2013 to 2017, and used amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, and
   nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively, to integrate
   analyses of gut microbiome structure and function with analysis of the
   colonic metabolome. The lemurs harbored species-specific microbiomes,
   metagenomes, and metabolomes that were tuned to their dietary
   specializations: Frugo-folivores had greater microbial and metagenomic
   diversity, and harbored generalist taxa. Mature-leaf folivores had
   greater individual microbiome variation, and taxa and metabolites
   putatively involved in cellulolysis. The consortia even differed between
   related, young-leaf specialists, with indri prioritizing metabolism of
   fiber and plant secondary compounds, and woolly lemurs prioritizing
   amino-acid cycling. Specialized gut microbiota and associated
   gastrointestinal morphologies enable folivores to variably tolerate
   resource fluctuation and support nutrient extraction from challenging
   resources (e.g., by metabolizing plant secondary compounds or
   recalcitrant fibers), perhaps ultimately facilitating host species'
   diversity and specialized feeding ecologies.},

Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative dementia.
   Mapping the pathomechanism and providing novel therapeutic options have
   paramount significance. Recent studies have proposed the role of LMTK2
   in AD. However, its expression pattern and association with the
   pathognomonic neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in different brain regions
   and neuropathological stages of AD is not clear. We performed
   chromogenic (CHR) LMTK2 and fluorescent phospho-tau/LMTK2
   double-labelling (FDL) immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 10-10 postmortem
   middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and anterior hippocampus (aHPC) samples with
   early and late neuropathological Braak tau stages of AD. MFG in early
   stage was our `endogenous control' region as it is not affected by NFTs.
   Semiquantitative CHR-IHC intensity scoring revealed significantly higher
   (p < 0.001) LMTK2 values in this group compared to NFT-affected regions.
   FDL-IHC demonstrated LMTK2 predominance in the endogenous control
   region, while phospho-tau overburden and decreased LMTK2 immunolabelling
   were detected in NFT-affected groups (aHPC in early and both regions in
   late stage). Spearman's correlation coefficient showed strong negative
   correlation between phospho-tau/LMTK2 signals within each group.
   According to our results, LMTK2 expression is inversely proportionate to
   the extent of NFT pathology, and decreased LMTK2 level is not a general
   feature in AD brain, rather it is characteristic of the NFT-affected
   regions.},

Title = {Assessing the function of geophagy in a Malagasy rain forest lemur},

Abstract = {Geophagy has been observed in nearly every long-term study of folivorous
   primates. Yet despite frequent observations of this behavior, conclusive
   explanations for soil consumption remain ambiguous. This study tests the
   most frequently proposed hypotheses for geophagy using data collected on
   the geophagic behavior of the Milne-Edwards' sifaka (Propithecus
   edwardsi) living in two forests with varying levels of disturbance
   within Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. Field data were collected
   from December 2002 to November 2003, during which time soil samples were
   collected for mineral analyses from 102 sites selected for geophagy and
   42 control sites at which no geophagy was recorded. Results indicate
   that control soils differ significantly between the two study sites and
   that this difference is primarily attributable to varying levels of
   habitat disturbance. The frequency of soil consumption also does not
   vary significantly by sex or between logged and unlogged habitats. Soil
   consumption significantly correlated with fruit/seed consumption
   overall, but to a lesser degree in logged compared with unlogged sites.
   Clay minerals found in soils likely prevent absorption of dietary toxins
   in the gut and/or may mediate gut pH. This provides strong evidence for
   the protection hypothesis for geophagy, which may be especially
   important in areas where logging, or other forms of habitat disturbance,
   has been experienced. in French is available with online material.},

Title = {One size fits all? Relationships among group size, health, and ecology
   indicate a lack of an optimal group size in a wild lemur population},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {73},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Group size is a key component of sociality and can affect individual
   health and fitness. However, proximate links explaining this
   relationship remain poorly understood, partly because previous studies
   neglected potential confounding effects of ecological factors. Here, we
   correlated group size with various measures of health while controlling
   for measures of seasonality and habitat quality, to explore trade-offs
   related to group living in a mainly folivorous primate-Verreaux's
   sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi). Over a course of 2 years, we studied 42
   individuals of 7 differently sized groups (range 2-10) and combined
   measures of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (n > 2300 samples),
   parasitism (n > 500 samples), ranging and activity patterns, together
   with estimates of habitat quality (measures of similar to 7000 feeding
   trees). None of our measures was correlated with group size, while
   seasonality, but not habitat quality, impacted almost all examined
   variables. We conclude that group size alone might be insufficient to
   explain patterns in the sociality-health nexus or that the small range
   of group sizes in this species does not induce effects suggested for
   species living in larger groups. An optimal group size balancing the
   advantages and disadvantages of living in differently sized groups may
   not exist for Verreaux's sifakas. Our results do not support predictions
   of the ecological constraints hypothesis or the optimal group size
   hypothesis as they may only account for species limited in group size by
   ecological factors-a condition that may not apply to the majority of
   folivorous mammals, which seem to be limited by social factors.},

Title = {Evidence of genetic monogamy in the lemur Indri (Indri indri)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {81},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Monogamy is a rare strategy among mammals but relatively common among
   primates. The study of the evolution of monogamy in mammals and primates
   is lacking empirical studies that assess the relationship between a
   pair-living social organization and genetic monogamy. Sexual or genetic
   monogamy can only be assessed by performing molecular analyses and
   investigating rates of extra-pair paternity (EPP). Studying the
   occurrence of EPP can provide valuable insights into reproductive
   strategies and their adaptive value. The indri is a pair-living primate
   that lives in stable groups. Their social units are composed of the
   reproductive pair and up to four more individuals, but extra-pair
   copulation (EPC) can occur. This raises the question of whether this
   event may or may not lead to EPP. Here, we investigated whether a
   pair-living social organization corresponds to genetic monogamy in
   indris (Indri indri). We analyzed the paternity of 12 offspring from
   seven pairs using a set of six microsatellite loci on fecal samples
   (mean number of alleles 11.7 +/- 1.8 (mean +/- standard deviation). We
   found that in 92\% of cases the genetic profile of the offspring matched
   the paired male of the group for all the loci considered. In the only
   case of paternity mismatch, the paternity assignment remained
   inconclusive. Our results show that I. indri genetic monogamy is the
   norm and supports the hypothesis that pair-living social organization is
   associated with low EPP rate. Also, our results are in contrast with the
   hypothesis of infertility as a reason to engage in EPC for this species.},

Abstract = {The book review is a remarkably durable form of criticism. It has
   survived perhaps threehundred years of cultural upheaval and
   philosophical turbulence with almost no alteration of spirit or basic
   format. We're so used to this piece of cultural furniture in its
   accustomed place that we neglect to ask the obvious questions. What is
   this thing? Is it functional or decorative or pointless?},

Title = {Costs of injury for scent signalling in a strepsirrhine primate},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Honesty is crucial in animal communication when signallers are conveying
   information about their condition. Condition dependence implies a cost
   to signal production; yet, evidence of such cost is scarce. We examined
   the effects of naturally occurring injury on the quality and salience of
   olfactory signals in ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). Over a decade, we
   collected genital secretions from 23 (13 male, 10 female) adults across
   34 unique injuries, owing primarily to intra-group fights. Using gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry, we tested for differences in the
   chemical composition of secretions across pre-injury, injury and
   recovery, in animals that did and did not receive antibiotics. Lemur
   genital secretions were significantly dampened and altered during
   injury, with patterns of change varying by sex, season and antibiotics.
   Using behavioural bioassays (excluding odorants from antibiotic-treated
   animals), we showed that male `recipients' discriminated injury status
   based on scent alone, directing more competitive counter marking towards
   odorants from injured vs. uninjured male `signallers.' That injured
   animals could not maintain their normal signatures provides rare
   evidence of the energetic cost to signal production. That conspecifics
   detected olfactory-encoded `weakness' suggests added behavioural costs:
   By influencing the likelihood of intra- or inter-sexual conflict,
   condition-dependent signals could have important implications for
   socio-reproductive behaviour.},
