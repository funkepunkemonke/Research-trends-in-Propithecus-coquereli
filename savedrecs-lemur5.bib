Abstract = {This paper represents the first participation of the Institute of
   Statistical Studies and Research (ISSR) at Cairo University group in
   CLEF 2009-Medical image retrieval track. The main objective is to
   improve retrieving medical image depending on associated image text. The
   other purpose of our participation is to experiment different text
   features such as article title, image caption and article paragraphs
   denoting to the image. We propose a simple and effective extraction
   method to find relevant paragraphs based on the structure of HTML files.
   Automatic translation of queries in different languages other than
   collection language is also experimented. For indexing and retrieval, we
   used the LEMUR toolkit. In this paper the results of 9 runs are
   submitted in order to compare retrieval based on different text
   features, as well as the effect of stop word lists and the use of
   relevance feedback.},

Abstract = {Virtual environments (VEs) can be used to study issues related to human
   navigation, such as spatial knowledge acquisition. In our prior work, we
   introduced a new locomotion technique (LT), named
   ``Finger-Walking-in-Place (FWIP){''}, for navigation tasks in immersive
   virtual environments (IVEs). The FWIP was designed to map human's
   embodied ability for real navigation to finger-based LT. A two-hand
   based implementation on a multi-touch device (i.e., Lemur) was
   evaluated. In this paper, we introduce the one-handed FWIP refined from
   the original design, and its implementation on a Lemur and an
   iPhone/iPod Touch. We present a comparative study of FWIP versus the
   joystick's flying LT to investigate the effect of the mapping of the
   human's embodied ability to the finger-based LT on spatial knowledge
   acquisition. This study results show that FWIP allows the subjects to
   replicate the route more accurately, compared to the joystick LT. There
   is no significant difference in survey knowledge acquisition between two
   LTs. However, the results are useful, especially given that the FWIP
   requires small physical movements, compared to walking-like physical
   LTs, and has positive effect on route knowledge acquisition, compared to
   the joystick LT.},

Title = {THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF STRONGYLOIDES ROBUSTUS ON PARASITE-MEDIATED
   COMPETITION BETWEEN TWO SPECIES OF FLYING SQUIRRELS (GLAUCOMYS)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {46},

Abstract = {There is growing evidence that populations of the northern flying
   squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) are declining in the eastern United
   States, perhaps due to competition with the southern flying squirrel
   (Glaucomys volans). Potential causes include parasite-mediated or
   apparent competition from the shared intestinal nematode, Strongyloides
   robustus, which has been shown to detrimentally affect the northern
   flying squirrel but not the southern flying squirrel. To investigate
   this hypothesis, we conducted a preliminary, study on the parasite
   community of both flying squirrel species from sites in Pennsylvania
   where the two species occur sympatrically and where G. sabrinus is now
   considered endangered at the state level. We compared these parasite
   communities with those from northern flying squirrels from northern New
   York where the southern flying squirrel is absent. We found eight
   species of gastrointestinal parasites (Pterygodermatites peromysci,
   Lemuricola sciuri, Syphacia thompsoni, Syphacia spp., Capillaria spp.,
   Citellinema bifurcatum., Strogyloides robustus, and an unidentifiable
   cestode species) in both species of flying squirrels examined for our
   study. The parasite-mediated competition hypothesis was partially
   supported. For example, in Pennsylvania, S. robustus,vas overdispersed
   in southern flying squirrels, Such that a small proportion of the hosts
   carried a large proportion of the worm population. In addition, we found
   S. robustus to be present in northern flaring squirrels when the species
   were sympatric, but not where southern flying squirrels were absent in
   New York. However, there was no association between S. robustus and the
   body condition of flying squirrels. We detected a potential parasite
   community interaction, as S. robustus abundance was positively
   associated with P. peromysci.},

Booktitle = {EVOLUTION OF EXUDATIVORY IN PRIMATES},
Series = {Developments in Primatology-Progress and Prospects},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {1-23},
Abstract = {In the 25 years since the last synthesis on this topic was published,
   there has been a marked increase in the appreciation of exudativory as a
   primate dietary strategy and investigations of its morphological
   correlates that appear to be adaptations to exudates as food. At least
   75 species of primates consume some exudates. Variability of diet among
   marmosets and tamarins precludes simple classifications of the former as
   year-round specialists vs. the latter as always facultative seasonal
   users of exudates. Differences in exudate use among callithrichines, now
   also including callimico as an exudativore, are associated with apparent
   adaptations in gut anatomy and functioning, a suite of dental and jaw
   features, and some features of socioecology and fife-history. Among
   strepsirrhines, several Nycticebus species are newly known to gouge to
   eat gum, variability among mouse lemurs in gum use has been documented,
   but little added work has improved our knowledge of variation in exudate
   use in galagos. For these taxa, much less is understood about possible
   morphological, behavioral and life-history adaptations and detailed
   descriptions of behaviors associated with exudate acquisition are needed
   from the field. The ability to identify anatomical features that will
   clarify the role of exudates in the diets of fossil primates remains a
   major challenge.},

Title = {Comparative Ecology of Exudate Feeding by Lorises (Nycticebus, Loris)
   and Pottos (Perodicticus, Arctocebus)},
Booktitle = {EVOLUTION OF EXUDATIVORY IN PRIMATES},
Series = {Developments in Primatology-Progress and Prospects},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {155-168},
Abstract = {Craniomandibular variation characterizes the five species of Asian slow
   loris (Nycticebus), but until now, few ecological studies have been
   available to understand the factors that underpin it. Here, we review
   feeding ecology of Asian lorises and African pottos, with emphasis on
   the importance of exudate feeding, including several new studies. We
   then present novel data on this behavior based on a 10-week study of N.
   coucang at Pusat Penyelamatan Satwa, Lampung, Sumatra, Indonesia.
   Lorises and pottos range in body size from 100 g (Loris tardigradus) to
   more than 2 kg (N. bengalensis). Three of the smallest species
   (Arctocebus calabarensis, A. aureus, L. tardigradus) rely mainly on
   insects and small invertebrates as dietary staples. Although
   Perodicticus is known to eat gum only from already open wounds, active
   gouging of bark to extract exudates or consumption of plant sap has now
   been observed in all other lorises. Five species (P potto, N. coucang,
   N. bengalensis, N. javanicus, N. pygmaeus) rely on exudates as a key
   food source. Although at all field sites, exudates are eaten all year
   round, at some, they become a key resource in times of food scarcity.
   Exudates have been extracted from 14 different plant families; Fabaceae
   is possibly the most important, currently consumed by all exudativorous
   species. Despite the lack of keeled nails, gouging behavior of lorises
   closely resembles that of marmosets and fork-marked lemurs, and involves
   active breaking of the plant surface; the audible nature of this
   behavior, as well as the characteristic marks left behind, makes it
   useful for determining the presence of Nycticebus in a forest. The
   captive lorises in our study also gouged regularly, recorded 2.9 times
   per hour for both adults and juveniles. Urine and facial marking
   accompanied the majority of gouges, a behavior recorded before only for
   marmosets. The functions of this behavior as a resource sharing strategy
   are explored. The importance of providing opportunity for gouging for
   captive lorises is also discussed, as a way to mitigate the periodontal
   diseases, which plague Nycticebus in captivity. We conclude by
   discussing the importance of a better understanding of this relatively
   unique behavior to improve our knowledge of morphological correlates to
   loris taxonomy and ecology, and captive management via dietary changes
   and enrichment.},

Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},
Pages = {293-303},
Abstract = {To better understand the extent of Class II transposable element
   activity in mammals, we investigated the mouse lemur, Microcebus
   murinus, whole genome shotgun (2X) draft assembly. Analysis of this
   strepsirrhine primate extended previous research that targeted
   anthropoid primates and found no activity within the last 37 Myr. We
   tested the hypothesis that members of the piggyBac Class II superfamily
   have been inactive in the strepsirrhine lineage of primates during the
   same period. Evidence against this hypothesis was discovered in the form
   of three nonautonomous piggyBac elements with activity periods within
   the past 40 Myr and possibly into the very recent past. In addition, a
   novel family of piggyBac transposons was identified, suggesting
   introduction via horizontal transfer. A second autonomous element was
   also found with high similarity to an element recently described from
   the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, further implicating horizontal
   transfer in the evolution of this genome. These findings indicate a more
   complex history of transposon activity in mammals rather than a uniform
   shutdown of Class II transposition, which had been suggested by analyses
   of more common model organisms.},

Abstract = {This chapter reviews the extent of primate gummivory, identifies
   phylogentic patterns in the degree of gummivory across primates, and
   examines overlap in the plant species whose exudates are consumed. Plant
   exudates are exploited both routinely and opportunistically by at least
   69 species of strepsirrhine, platyrrhine, and catarrhine primates.
   Gummivory is particularly prevalent among the callitrichids,
   cheirogaleids, and galagos in terms of the number of species reported to
   consume gum, its contribution to their diet, and the number of plant
   species they exploit for it. While some marmosets, galagos and the
   fork-marked lemur are thought of as gum specialists, exudates may
   account for more than 10\% of the diet in many other species. Gum
   feeding may increase further during periods of dry season resource
   scarcity with some, most notably Parkia pod gums, acting as a keystone
   resource for many New World monkeys. Exudates from at least 250 plant
   species in 170 genera and 63 families are eaten, with Fabaceae and
   Anacardiaceae being the most frequently exploited. The Callitrichidae
   were examined for patterns in the amount of gum they consumed.
   Differences in the prevalence of gummivory were linked to morphological
   adaptations, particularly dentition, and habitat seasonality. Cluster
   analysis of the plant families exploited by different primate genera
   revealed similarities based on the number of families they exploited for
   gums.},

Abstract = {In this paper we describe our participation in the 2009 CLEF-IP task,
   which was targeted at prior-art search for topic patent documents. We
   opted for a baseline approach to get a feeling for the specifics of the
   task and the documents used. Our system retrieved patent documents based
   on a standard bag-of-words approach for both the Main Task and the
   English Task. In both runs, we extracted the claim sections from all
   English patents in the corpus and saved them in the Lemur index format
   with the patent IDs as DOCIDs. These claims were then indexed using
   Lemur's Build Index function. In the topic documents we also focused
   exclusively on the claims sections. These were extracted and converted
   to queries by removing stopwords and punctuation. We did not perform any
   term selection or query expansion. We retrieved 100 patents per topic
   using Lemur's RetEval function, retrieval model TF-IDF. Compared to the
   other runs submitted to the track, we obtained good results in terms of
   nDCG (0.46) and moderate results in terms of MAP (0.054).},

Title = {Extreme variability among mammalian V1R gene families},
Journal = {GENOME RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-18},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We report an evolutionary analysis of the V1R gene family across 37
   mammalian genomes. V1Rs comprise one of three chemosensory receptor
   families expressed in the vomeronasal organ, and contribute to pheromone
   detection. We first demonstrate that Trace Archive data can be used
   effectively to determine V1R family sizes and to obtain sequences of
   most V1R family members. Analyses of V1R sequences from trace data and
   genome assemblies show that species-specific expansions previously
   observed in only eight species were prevalent throughout mammalian
   evolution, resulting in ``semiprivate{''} V1R repertoires for most
   mammals. The largest families are found in mouse and platypus, whose V1R
   repertoires have been published previously, followed by mouse lemur and
   rabbit (similar to 215 and similar to 160 intact V1Rs, respectively). In
   contrast, two bat species and dolphin possess no functional V1Rs, only
   pseudogenes, and suffered inactivating mutations in the vomeronasal
   signal transduction gene Trpc2. We show that primate V1R decline
   happened prior to acquisition of trichromatic vision, earlier during
   evolution than was previously thought. We also show that it is extremely
   unlikely that decline of the dog V1R repertoire occurred in response to
   selective pressures imposed by humans during domestication. Functional
   repertoire sizes in each species correlate roughly with anatomical
   observations of vomeronasal organ size and quality; however, no single
   ecological correlate explains the very diverse fates of this gene family
   in different mammalian genomes. V1Rs provide one of the most extreme
   examples observed to date of massive gene duplication in some genomes,
   with loss of all functional genes in other species.},

Title = {Possible Fruit Protein Effects on Primate Communities in Madagascar and
   the Neotropics},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {Background: The ecological factors contributing to the evolution of
   tropical vertebrate communities are still poorly understood. Primate
   communities of the tropical Americas have fewer folivorous but more
   frugivorous genera than tropical regions of the Old World and especially
   many more frugivorous genera than Madagascar. Reasons for this
   phenomenon are largely unexplored. We developed the hypothesis that
   Neotropical fruits have higher protein concentrations than fruits from
   Madagascar and that the higher representation of frugivorous genera in
   the Neotropics is linked to high protein concentrations in fruits. Low
   fruit protein concentrations in Madagascar would restrict the evolution
   of frugivores in Malagasy communities.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We reviewed the literature for nitrogen
   concentrations in fruits from the Neotropics and from Madagascar, and
   analyzed fruits from an additional six sites in the Neotropics and six
   sites in Madagascar. Fruits from the Neotropical sites contain
   significantly more nitrogen than fruits from the Madagascar sites.
   Nitrogen concentrations in New World fruits are above the concentrations
   to satisfy nitrogen requirements of primates, while they are at the
   lower end or below the concentrations to cover primate protein needs in
   Madagascar.
   Conclusions/Significance: Fruits at most sites in the Neotropics contain
   enough protein to satisfy the protein needs of primates. Thus, selection
   pressure to develop new adaptations for foods that are difficult to
   digest (such as leaves) may have been lower in the Neotropics than in
   Madagascar. The low nitrogen concentrations in fruits from Madagascar
   may contribute to the almost complete absence of frugivorous primate
   species on this island.},

Abstract = {Recent fossil discoveries have demonstrated that Africa and Asia were
   epicentres for the origin and/or early diversification of the major
   living primate lineages, including both anthropoids (monkeys, apes and
   humans) and crown strepsirhine primates (lemurs, lorises and galagos).
   Competing hypotheses favouring either an African or Asian origin for
   anthropoids rank among the most hotly contested issues in
   paleoprimatology. The Afrocentric model for anthropoid origins rests
   heavily on the >45 Myr old fossil Algeripithecus minutus from Algeria,
   which is widely acknowledged to be one of the oldest known anthropoids.
   However, the phylogenetic position of Algeripithecus with respect to
   other primates has been tenuous because of the highly fragmentary
   fossils that have documented this primate until now. Recently recovered
   and more nearly complete fossils of Algeripithecus and contemporaneous
   relatives reveal that they are not anthropoids. New data support the
   idea that Algeripithecus and its sister genus Azibius are the earliest
   offshoots of an Afro-Arabian strepsirhine clade that embraces extant
   toothcombed primates and their fossil relatives. Azibius exhibits
   anatomical evidence for nocturnality. Algeripithecus has a long, thin
   and forwardly inclined lower canine alveolus, a feature that is entirely
   compatible with the long and procumbent lower canine included in the
   toothcomb of crown strepsirhines. These results strengthen an ancient
   African origin for crown strepsirhines and, in turn, strongly challenge
   the role of Africa as the ancestral homeland for anthropoids.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was determine, the prevalence of the
   gastrointestinal parasites of wild primates in captivity in the Republic
   of Panama during the year 2008. During the year 2008 in two Zoos, the
   summit Municipal Zoo and the Nispero Zoo, there were recollected 87
   fecal samples belong to 29, no human clinically healthy individuals of
   the Ateles geoffroyi, Ateles fuciceps, Cebus capucinus, Saguinus
   geoffroyi and Aotus lemurinus species. The samples were processed by the
   qualitave analysis of concentration by sedimentation using the
   formol-acetate of ethylic protocol and the modified Zielh-Neelsen's dye.
   Four genres of major prevalence in primates were identified as:
   Criptosporidium sp., Endolimax nana, Estrongiloides sp. and Entamoeba
   sp. The parasite with major prevalence was Criptosporidium sp. in Ateles
   fuciceps. It is important to mention that two PGI have not been reported
   in Panama, being these: Oesophagostomun sp. and Enteromonas hominis. The
   asociation between the levels of gastrointestinal parasites in both
   studied zoos, was evalued using Fisher's exact test and the results
   indicated that there exists no significantive difference between them
   and the level of significance of p<0.05. This is Panama's first record
   of the species of gastrointestinal parasites that affects the animals in
   captivity therefore, this research will serve as a guide to establish
   the necessary preventive measures to favor the conversation of these
   species.},

   mycobacteria to be identified to species level more easily. Most of the
   unusual mycobacterial species have most likely been present in the
   region for many years and have probably caused disease episodes before,
   but have been misdiagnosed. Each case must be evaluated carefully with
   respect to the animal species involved, the environment in which the
   host is found and the mycobacterial species, and operational decisions
   made accordingly.},

Title = {A fully resolved genus level phylogeny of neotropical primates
   (Platyrrhini)},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There are more than 125 species of extant New World monkeys (Primates:
   Platyrrhini) found in approximately 15 genera. The phylogenetic
   relationships of these neotropical primates have been extensively
   studied from a molecular perspective. While these studies have been
   successful at inferring many of the relationships within the
   platyrrhines, key questions remain. The current study provides a
   framework for using non-genic, non-coding markers in comparative primate
   phylogenomic studies in species whose genomes are not yet scheduled for
   complete sequencing. A random genomic shotgun library was generated from
   the nocturnal Owl monkey Aotus lemurinus. Eleven unlinked, non-coding,
   non-genic, non-repetitive, nuclear DNA markers derived from this library
   were sequenced in at least one representative species of every
   platyrrhine genus. The combined sequence from these markers yielded a
   7.7 kb multiple sequence alignment of 22 taxa. We analyzed these markers
   independently and combined with a 10 kb dataset consisting of
   ``traditional,{''} previously published markers located within or
   directly adjacent to genes. Parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian
   analysis converged on a single topology for the platyrrhine generic
   relationships. Notably, we confidently inferred that Pitheciidae is the
   sister taxon to the other two platyrrhine families (Cebidae, Atelidae).
   This relationship is supported by high values of branch support as well
   as topology tests. Additionally, Aotus formed a sister taxon to a clade
   comprising Cebus and Saimiri. With a fully resolved platyrrhine
   phylogeny in place it is now possible to design and test hypotheses
   regarding the evolution and diversification of platyrrhine phenotypes
   and life histories. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We hypothesise that the spiny fruits of the endemic Madagascar genus
   Uncarina (Pedaliaceae) are trample burrs that evolved to be dispersed on
   the feet of the extinct elephant bird (Aepyornis). Our evidence is: i)
   the morphology of the fruit with its large grapple hooks is more likely
   to attach to a foot than to adhere to fur and ii) the presentation of
   mature fruits on the ground rather than in the canopy. These differences
   to adhesive burrs make lemurs unlikely dispersers. We argue, given the
   absence of other large terrestrial mammals in Madagascar, that the most
   likely dispersers of Uncarina fruits were the extinct large birds. If
   correct, our hypothesis has implications for conservation of Uncarina,
   the biogeography of the elephant birds and dispersal biology. For
   example, we predict that the demography of Uncarina will be skewed
   towards adult plants, and that the dispersal mutualism could possibly be
   rescued by domestic animals.},

Title = {Estimating the phylogeny and divergence times of primates using a
   supermatrix approach},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {Background: The primates are among the most broadly studied mammalian
   orders, with the published literature containing extensive analyses of
   their behavior, physiology, genetics and ecology. The importance of this
   group in medical and biological research is well appreciated, and
   explains the numerous molecular phylogenies that have been proposed for
   most primate families and genera. Composite estimates for the entire
   order have been infrequently attempted, with the last phylogenetic
   reconstruction spanning the full range of primate evolutionary
   relationships having been conducted over a decade ago.
   Results: To estimate the structure and tempo of primate evolutionary
   history, we employed Bayesian phylogenetic methods to analyze data
   supermatrices comprising 7 mitochondrial genes (6,138 nucleotides) from
   219 species across 67 genera and 3 nuclear genes (2,157 nucleotides)
   from 26 genera. Many taxa were only partially represented, with an
   average of 3.95 and 5.43 mitochondrial genes per species and per genus,
   respectively, and 2.23 nuclear genes per genus. Our analyses of
   mitochondrial DNA place Tarsiiformes as the sister group of
   Strepsirrhini. Within Haplorrhini, we find support for the primary
   divergence of Pitheciidae in Platyrrhini, and our results suggest a
   sister grouping of African and non-African colobines within Colobinae
   and of Cercopithecini and Papionini within Cercopthecinae. Date
   estimates for nodes within each family and genus are presented, with
   estimates for key splits including: Strepsirrhini-Haplorrhini 64 million
   years ago (MYA), Lemuriformes-Lorisiformes 52 MYA,
   Platyrrhini-Catarrhini 43 MYA and Cercopithecoidea-Hominoidea 29 MYA.
   Conclusion: We present an up-to-date, comprehensive estimate of the
   structure and tempo of primate evolutionary history. Although
   considerable gaps remain in our knowledge of the primate phylogeny,
   increased data sampling, particularly from nuclear loci, will be able to
   provide further resolution.},

Journal = {PLOS GENETICS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {5},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {There are two main classes of natural killer (NK) cell receptors in
   mammals, the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and the
   structurally unrelated killer cell lectin-like receptors (KLR). While
   KIR represent the most diverse group of NK receptors in all primates
   studied to date, including humans, apes, and Old and New World monkeys,
   KLR represent the functional equivalent in rodents. Here, we report a
   first digression from this rule in lemurs, where the KLR (CD94/NKG2)
   rather than KIR constitute the most diverse group of NK cell receptors.
   We demonstrate that natural selection contributed to such
   diversification in lemurs and particularly targeted KLR residues
   interacting with the peptide presented by MHC class I ligands. We
   further show that lemurs lack a strict ortholog or functional equivalent
   of MHC-E, the ligands of nonpolymorphic KLR in ``higher{''} primates.
   Our data support the existence of a hitherto unknown system of
   polymorphic and diverse NK cell receptors in primates and of
   combinatorial diversity as a novel mechanism to increase NK cell
   receptor repertoire.},

Abstract = {The Mecyclothorax Sharp beetle fauna of Oahu, Hawaii is revised,
   including the description of 13 new species-M. acherontius, M. uncinus,
   M. lobatus, M. dentatus, M. calceus, M. euryoides, M. invictus, M.
   ovatulus, M. lemur, M. satyrus, M. ramsdalei, M. pelops and M. niobe
   spp.n.-to complement the six previously described species. Several
   cryptic species complexes characterized by similar external anatomy and
   highly divergent male genitalia are present in the fauna, including the
   M. brevis (Blackburn) species complex-four species sympatrically
   distributed on Tantalus, a mountain on the northern margin of
   Honolulu-and the sympatric sister species M. carteri (Perkins) and M.
   invictus from Mt. Kaala in the western Waianae Range. This repeated
   pattern of closely related species characterized by divergent male
   genitalia and relatively static external anatomy is also observed in the
   Mecyclothorax fauna of Molokai, an island of moderate geologic age
   within the Hawaiian archipelago, but not in the Mecyclothorax fauna of
   the most recently emergent Hawaii Island. Species distributions are
   generally also much more restricted on the older islands. These results
   are consistent with the occurrence of rampant, unfixed infraspecific
   genitalic variation early in an island radiation, with subsequent
   fixation of divergent genitalic characters occurring as speciation
   proceeds. Three distinct areas of endemism are defined by distributions
   of Oahu Mecyclothorax: the Waianae Range, the north Koolau Range and the
   south Koolau Range. Species distributions in two other carabid beetle
   genera in Hawaii containing native species-Blackburnia Sharp and
   Bembidion Latreille-congruently define these areas. The historical range
   of sampling dates is compared for Mecyclothorax species across the three
   areas, with the greatest diminution of recently collected species-level

Abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) does not replicate in
   primary cells of New World primates. To better understand this
   restriction, we expressed owl monkey (Aotus nancymaae) CD4 and CXCR4 in
   the owl monkey kidney cell line, OMK. An HIV-1 variant modified to evade
   the owl monkey restriction factor TRIM-cyp replicated efficiently in
   these cells but could not replicate in primary A. nancymaae CD4-positive
   T cells. To understand this difference, we examined APOBEC3G and
   tetherin orthologs from OMK cells and primary A. nancymaae cells. We
   observed that OMK cells expressed substantially lower levels of APOBEC3G
   than did A. nancymaae cells. A. nancymaae, but not marmoset (Callithrix
   jacchus), APOBEC3G was partially downregulated by HIV-1 vif and reduced
   but did not abolish HIV-1 replication when stably expressed in OMK
   cells. The functional difference between A. nancymaae and marmoset
   APOBEC3Gs mapped to residue 128, previously shown to distinguish African
   green monkey from human APOBEC3G. We also characterized tetherin
   orthologs from OMK and A. nancymaae cells. The A. nancymaae tetherin
   ortholog, but not OMK tetherin, prevented HIV-1 release. Alteration of
   threonine 181 of OMK tetherin rescued its function and its efficient N
   glycosylation. All alleles of Aotus lemurinus griseimembra examined, but
   none of A. nancymaae or Aotus vociferans, encoded this nonfunctional
   tetherin ortholog. Our data indicate that HIV-1 replication in owl
   monkeys is not restricted at entry but can be limited by APOBEC3G and
   tetherin. Further, A. lemurinus griseimembra does not restrict HIV-1
   replication via tetherin, a property likely useful for the study of
   tetherin-restricted viruses.},

Title = {Flowers Are an Important Food for Small Apes in Southern Sumatra},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {71},
Number = {8},
Pages = {624-635},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Flowers are included in the diets of many primates, but are not
   generally regarded as making an important contribution to primate energy
   budgets. However, observations of a number of lemur, platyrrhine, and
   cercopithecine populations suggest that some flower species may function
   as key primate fallback foods in periods of low abundance of preferred
   foods (generally ripe fruits), and that flowers may be preferred foods
   in some cases. I report heavy reliance on flowers during some study
   months for a siamang (Symphalangus syndactylus) population in southern
   Sumatra. Siamangs, at Way Canguk spent 12\% of feeding time eating
   flowers from October 2000 to August 2002, and in I month flower-feeding
   time exceeded 40\% of total feeding time. The overall availabilities of
   fig and nonfig fruits, flowers, and new leaves in the study area were
   not significant predictors of the proportion of time that siamangs spent
   consuming any plant part. However, flower-feeding time was highest in
   months when nonfig fruit-feeding time was lowest, and a switch from
   heavy reliance on fruit to substantial flower consumption was associated
   with a shift in activity patterns toward reduced energy expenditure,
   which is consistent with the interpretation that flowers may function as
   a fallback food for Way Canguk siamangs. Hydnocarpus gracilis, a plant
   from which siamangs only consume flowers, was the third-most-commonly
   consumed plant at Way Canguk (after Ficus spp. and Dracontomelon dao),
   and flowers from this plant were available in most months. It is
   possible that relatively high local availability of these important
   siamang plant foods is one factor promoting high siamang density in the
   study area. Am. J. Primatol. 71:624-635, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Primate phylogenomics: developing numerous nuclear non-coding,
   non-repetitive markers for ecological and phylogenetic applications and
   analysis of evolutionary rate variation},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Background: Genetic analyses are often limited by the availability of
   appropriate molecular markers. Markers from neutrally evolving genomic
   regions may be particularly useful for inferring evolutionary histories
   because they escape the constraints of natural selection. For the
   majority of taxa however, obtaining such markers is challenging.
   Advances in genomics have the potential to alleviate the shortage of
   neutral markers. Here we present a method to develop numerous markers
   from putatively neutral regions of primate genomes.
   Results: We began with the available whole genome sequences of human,
   chimpanzee and macaque. Using computational methods, we identified a
   total of 280 potential amplicons from putatively neutral, non-coding,
   non-repetitive regions of these genomes. Subsequently we amplified,
   using experimental methods, many of these amplicons from diverse primate
   taxa, including a ring-tailed lemur, which is distantly related to the
   genomic resources. Using a subset of 10 markers, we demonstrate the
   utility of the developed markers in phylogenetic and evolutionary rate
   analyses. Particularly, we uncovered substantial evolutionary rate
   variation among lineages, some of which are previously not reported.
   Conclusion: We successfully developed numerous markers from putatively
   neutral regions of primate genomes using a strategy combining
   computational and experimental methods. Applying these markers to
   phylogenetic and evolutionary rate variation analyses exemplifies the
   utility of these markers. Diverse ecological and evolutionary analyses
   will benefit from these markers. Importantly, methods similar to those
   presented here can be applied to other taxa in the near future.},

Title = {Complete Primate Skeleton from the Middle Eocene of Messel in Germany:
   Morphology and Paleobiology},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 19},
Abstract = {Background: The best European locality for complete Eocene mammal
   skeletons is Grube Messel, near Darmstadt, Germany. Although the site
   was surrounded by a para-tropical rain forest in the Eocene, primates
   are remarkably rare there, and only eight fragmentary specimens were
   known until now. Messel has now yielded a full primate skeleton. The
   specimen has an unusual history: it was privately collected and sold in
   two parts, with only the lesser part previously known. The second part,
   which has just come to light, shows the skeleton to be the most complete
   primate known in the fossil record.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We describe the morphology and
   investigate the paleobiology of the skeleton. The specimen is described
   as Darwinius masillae n.gen. n.sp. belonging to the Cercamoniinae.
   Because the skeleton is lightly crushed and bones cannot be handled
   individually, imaging studies are of particular importance. Skull
   radiography shows a host of teeth developing within the juvenile face.
   Investigation of growth and proportion suggest that the individual was a
   weaned and independent-feeding female that died in her first year of
   life, and might have attained a body weight of 650-900 g had she lived
   to adulthood. She was an agile, nail-bearing, generalized arboreal
   quadruped living above the floor of the Messel rain forest.
   Conclusions/Significance: Darwinius masillae represents the most
   complete fossil primate ever found, including both skeleton, soft body
   outline and contents of the digestive tract. Study of all these features
   allows a fairly complete reconstruction of life history, locomotion, and
   diet. Any future study of Eocene-Oligocene primates should benefit from
   information preserved in the Darwinius holotype. Of particular
   importance to phylogenetic studies, the absence of a toilet claw and a
   toothcomb demonstrates that Darwinius masillae is not simply a fossil
   lemur, but part of a larger group of primates, Adapoidea, representative
   of the early haplorhine diversification.},

Title = {Comparative analysis of Alu repeats in primate genomes},
Journal = {GENOME RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {19},
Number = {5},
Pages = {876-885},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Using bacteria artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences (16.9 Mb) and
   high-quality alignments of genomic sequences (17.4 Mb), we performed a
   global assessment of the divergence distributions, phylogenies, and
   consensus sequences for Alu elements in primates including lemur,
   marmoset, macaque, baboon, and chimpanzee as compared to human. We found
   that in lemurs, Alu elements show a broader and more symmetric sequence
   divergence distribution, suggesting a steady rate of Alu
   retrotransposition activity among prosimians. In contrast, Alu elements
   in anthropoids show a skewed distribution shifted toward more ancient
   elements with continual declining rates in recent Alu activity along the
   hominoid lineage of evolution. Using an integrated approach combining
   mutation profile and insertion/deletion analyses, we identified nine
   novel lineage-specific Alu subfamilies in lemur (seven), marmoset (one),
   and baboon/macaque (one) containing multiple diagnostic mutations
   distinct from their human counterparts-Alu J, S, and Y subfamilies,
   respectively. Among these primates, we show that that the lemur has the
   lowest density of Alu repeats (55 repeats/Mb), while marmoset has the
   greatest abundance (188 repeats/Mb). We estimate that similar to 70\% of
   lemur and 16\% of marmoset Alu elements belong to lineage-specific
   subfamilies. Our analysis has provided an evolutionary framework for
   further classification and refinement of the Alu repeat phylogeny. The
   differences in the distribution and rates of Alu activity have played an
   important role in subtly reshaping the structure of primate genomes. The
   functional consequences of these changes among the diverse primate
   lineages over such short periods of evolutionary time are an important
   area of future investigation.},

Abstract = {Key features of pectoral girdle and forelimbs in flying lemurs and bats
   are foremost associated with locomotion characteristics (requiring
   lateral moving of limbs apart) of these animals. Apart from tree-shrews,
   flying lemurs and bats scapula have been translocated to the dorsal side
   and are located in the horizontal position; their mobility pattern has
   been changed significantly. A new evolutionary ecomorphological scenario
   is proposed. The scenario describes a probable process of the continuous
   transformation of typical parasagittal forelimb of bat ancestor. fit the
   course of this transformation, forelimb passes through stages of
   adaptation to moving of animals on tree trunks of large diameter and to
   in-canopy locomotion. Though bats and flying lemurs belong to different
   evolutionary branches, they have possibly passed through it similar
   evolutionary stage associated with the adaptation to locomotion on large
   vertical tree trunks on it way to modem specializations.},

Abstract = {The earliest Neotropical primate fossils complete enough for taxonomic
   assessment, Dolichocebus, Tremacebus, and Chilecebus, date to
   approximately 20 Ma. These have been interpreted as either closely
   related to extant forms or as extinct stem lineages. The former
   hypothesis of morphological stasis requires most living platyrrhine
   genera to have diverged before 20 Ma. To test this hypothesis, we
   collected new complete mitochondrial genomes from Aotus lemurinus,
   Saimiri sciureus, Saguinus oedipus, Ateles belzebuth, and Callicebus
   donacophilus. We combined these with published sequences from Cebus
   albifrons and other primates to infer the mitochondrial phylogeny. We
   found support for a cebid/atelid clade to the exclusion of the
   pitheciids. Then, using Bayesian methods and well-supported fossil
   calibration constraints, we estimated that the platyrrhine most recent
   common ancestor (MRCA) dates to 19.5 Ma, with all major lineages
   diverging by 14.3 Ma. Next, we estimated catarrhine divergence dates on
   the basis of platyrrhine divergence scenarios and found that only a
   platyrrhine MRCA less than 21 Ma is concordant with the catarrhine
   fossil record. Finally, we calculated that 33\% more change in the rate
   of evolution is required for platyrrhine divergences consistent with the
   morphologic stasis hypothesis than for a more recent radiation. We
   conclude that Dolichocebus, Tremacebus, and Chilecebus are likely too
   old to be crown platyrrhines, suggesting they were part of an extinct
   early radiation. We note that the crown platyrrhine radiation was
   concomitant with the radiation of 2 South American xenarthran lineages
   and follows a global temperature peak and tectonic activity in the
   Andes.},

Title = {Mating First, Mating More: Biological Market Fluctuation in a Wild
   Prosimian},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {In biology, economics, and politics, distributive power is the key for
   understanding asymmetrical relationships and it can be obtained by force
   (dominance) or trading (leverage). Whenever males cannot use force, they
   largely depend on females for breeding opportunities and the balance of
   power tilts in favour of females. Thus, males are expected not only to
   compete within their sex-class but also to exchange services with the
   opposite sex. Does this mating market, described for humans and apes,
   apply also to prosimians, the most ancestral primate group? To answer
   the question, we studied a scent-oriented and gregarious lemur,
   Propithecus verreauxi (sifaka), showing female dominance, promiscuous
   mating, and seasonal breeding. We collected 57 copulations involving 8
   males and 4 females in the wild (Berenty Reserve, South Madagascar), and
   data (all occurrences) on grooming, aggressions, and marking behaviour.
   We performed the analyses via exact Spearman and matrix correlations.
   Male mating priority rank correlated with the frequency of male
   countermarking over female scents but not with the proportion of fights
   won by males over females. Thus, males competed in an olfactory
   tournament more than in an arena of aggressive encounters. The
   copulation frequency correlated neither with the proportion of fights
   won by males nor with the frequency of male countermarking on female
   scents. Male-to-female grooming correlated with female-to-male grooming
   only during premating. Instead, in the mating period male-to-female
   grooming correlated with the copulation frequency. In short, the
   biological market underwent seasonal fluctuations, since males bargained
   grooming for sex in the mating days and grooming for itself in the
   premating period. Top scent-releasers gained mating priority (they mated
   first) and top groomers ensured a higher number of renewed copulations
   (they mated more). In conclusion, males maximize their reproduction
   probability by adopting a double tactic and by following market
   fluctuations.},

Abstract = {Malagasy dung beetles have evolved with a diverse group Of primates
   (lemurs), the largest extant native herbivores on the island. The two
   main radiations include the endemic subtribe Helictopleurina (65
   species) and the tribe Canthonini with several endemic genera (c. 170
   species),both of Which Occur primarily in forests ad feed oil lemur
   faeces and carrion. Cattle were introduced to Madagascar about 1000
   years ago, thereby establishing a completely new, indigenous dung type
   of resource (cattle dung) to , beetles. We report three striking
   patterns in the occurrence of clung beetles in cattle dung based on
   semi-quantitative sampling at nearly 80 localities across Madagascar.
   First, no clung beetles have shifted to Use primarily cattle dung ill
   wet forests, in contrast to other tropical regions, where ungulate dung
   is a key resource for dung beetles. Second, the community in open
   habitats includes 21 species (three Canthonini, six Helictopleurina, one
   Scarabaeini, four Onthophagini, six Aphodiini, and one Dicladyliini),
   which is only a small fraction of the species number in comparable
   communities in mainland Africa. Third, nearly all species using cattle
   dung have maximally large geographic ranges across Madagascar, in marked
   contrast to relatively small ranges among forest-inhabiting species.
   This latter point applies also to four endemic Helictopleurina species,
   which have shifted to cattle dung in open areas and have subsequently
   expanded their ranges in comparison with their relatives inhabiting
   forests. The Most numerous species in the community is the introduced
   Digitonthophagns gazella. We show, that the abundance of D. gazella in
   local communities has no noticeable effect on the species composition in
   the remaining community.},

Abstract = {Philippine sardines are members of the commercially important Sardinella
   genus (Family Clupeidae). Sardines are mostly marine species with a very
   few exception like the Philippine freshwater sardine, Sardinella
   tawilis, of Lake Taal. This species is believed to have immigrated from
   Balayan Bay some 250 years ago. To determine the relationship of
   freshwater S. tawilis to the marine forms, 35 biometric features were
   investigated. The variables were subjected to univariate (mean, standard
   deviation and coefficient of variance) and multivariate analyses
   {[}Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster
   Analysis]. Results from univariate tests revealed that the number of
   ventral fin ray can discriminate Sardinella lemuru from the rest of the
   sardines. Multivariate PCA, on the other hand, showed discrete
   separation of the marine sardines. Sardinella tawilis, however, cannot
   be clearly separated from the marine species, Sardinella albella. The
   same clustering was recovered in HCA, thus providing evidence that S.
   albella is the closest marine relative of the freshwater S. tawilis.},

Title = {PLASMA LEVELS OF INTERFERON-gamma CORRELATE WITH AGE-RELATED
   DISTURBANCES OF CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS AND SURVIVAL IN A NON-HUMAN PRIMATE},
Journal = {CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL},

Abstract = {Aging can be associated with changes in circadian rhythms and reduction
   in adaptive immune responses accompanied by expansion of memory T cells
   and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Recent findings
   suggest the cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) can affect the
   function of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master
   mammalian circadian pacemaker, both in vitro and in vivo. We studied the
   correlation of plasma levels of IFN-gamma and changes in circadian
   rhythms in a non-human primate species, the nocturnal mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus). Plasma IFN-gamma and dehydroepiandrosterone
   sulfate (DHEA-S), a known biomarker of aging, were determined in middle-
   to old-age animals by immunoenzymoassay. Daily rhythms of locomotor
   activity and body temperature as well as survival time of the lemurs
   were recorded. With aging, mean levels of DHEA-S decreased whereas
   IFN-gamma increased. Aged animals showed biological rhythm alterations
   characterized by a high percentage of diurnal activity, anticipation of
   the activity onset relative to lights-off, short free-running period,
   and delayed occurrence of minimal body temperature. The magnitude of
   these disturbances was correlated with the plasma level of IFN-gamma but
   not DHEA-S. Most remarkably, in contrast to DHEA-S, increased levels of
   IFN-gamma correlated with duration of the lifetime of the lemurs. These
   results show the degree of circadian rhythm alterations in an individual
   is correlated with plasma IFN-gamma level during aging, and that plasma
   IFN-gamma level may predict survival, at least in this non-human
   primate. (Author correspondence: fabienne.aujard@wanadoo.fr)},

Abstract = {The study of microfloras and megafloras from western Argentina and
   southern Bolivia presented here extends our knowledge of the
   biodiversity and succession of floristic events during the Middle
   Devonian, and hence improves the current biostratigraphy. Among floral
   remains, species attributable to `Haplostigma' are mostly recorded from
   the same Grandispora pseudoreticulata and other palynomorph-bearing
   sections at Balapuca ( southern Bolivia) and Del Chaco and La Cortadera
   creeks in the Precordillera of Argentina. The northernmost record of
   Grandispora pseudoreticulata is recorded from a third palynoassemblage
   from the Pando x-1 corehole of northern Bolivia. A great similarity
   among all these assemblages ( notably abundant Grandispora
   pseudoreticulata) suggests the identification of terrestrial
   connections, or at least proximity, of these local areas and other
   regions in South America during the Givetian. Comparison with other
   contemporary Gondwanan palynofloras shows cosmopolitan species ( e. g.
   Geminospora lemurata, Samarisporites triangulatus, Archaeozonotriletes
   variabilis, Chelinospora concinna) along with some others with more
   restricted distribution ( e. g. Grandispora pseudoreticulata,
   Leiotriletes balapucensis, Acinosporites ledundae). This pattern defines
   an Afro-South American Subrealm, which most likely results from the
   effects of palaeolatitude and, in a lesser way, local
   palaeoenvironmental conditions. On the other hand, such a level of
   cosmopolitanism supports previous palaeogeographical reconstructions
   where a narrow Rheic Ocean was developed between Euramerica and the
   northern parts of Africa and South America.},

Abstract = {The colugos, or flying lemurs (Dermoptera), are arboreal gliding mammals
   that are commonly grouped with tree-shrews (Scandentia) and Primates in
   the superorder Euarchonta. However, little is known about the head and
   neck muscles of these gliding mammals. This raises difficulties for the
   discussion of not only the functional morphology and evolution of
   colugos, but also the origin, evolution, functional morphology, and
   phylogenetic relationships of the Euarchonta as a whole, and thus also
   of our own clade, the Primates. In this work, I describe the head and
   neck muscles of the colugo Cynocephalus volans, and compare these
   muscles with those of other mammals, either dissected by me or described
   in the literature. My observations and comparisons indicate that, with
   respect to the number of muscles, the plesiomorphic condition for
   euarchontans as well as for primates is more similar to that found in
   extant tree-shrews than in extant colugos. This is because various
   muscles that were probably plesiomorphically present in the euarchontan
   and primate clades, as, e.g., the stylohyoideus, mandibulo-auricularis,
   cleido-occipitalis, omohyoideus, and sternohyoideus, are not present as
   independent elements in extant colugos. These observations and
   comparisons also indicate that various laryngeal and facial muscles that
   are present in modern humans were absent in the last common ancestor of
   extant primates. J. Morphol. 270:14-51, 2009. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   Birth-and-Death Process},
Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {1},
Pages = {258-264},
Abstract = {Olfactory receptor (OR) is a large family of G protein-coupled receptors
   that can detect odorant in order to generate the sense of smell. They
   constitute one of the largest multiple gene families in animals
   including primates. To better understand the variation in odor
   perception and evolution of OR genes among primates, we computationally
   identified OR gene repertoires in orangutans, marmosets, and mouse
   lemurs and investigated the birth-and-death process of OR genes in the
   primate lineage. The results showed that 1) all the primate species
   studied have no more than 400 intact OR genes, fewer than rodents and
   canine; 2) Despite the similar number of OR genes in the genome, the
   makeup of the OR gene repertoires between different primate species is
   quite different as they had undergone dramatic birth-and-death evolution
   with extensive gene losses in the lineages leading to current species;
   3) Apes and Old World monkey (OWM) have similar fraction of pseudogenes,
   whereas New World monkey (NWM) have fewer pseudogenes. To measure the
   selective pressure that had affected the OR gene repertoires in
   primates, we compared the ratio of nonsynonymous with synonymous
   substitution rates by using 70 one-to-one orthologous quintets among
   five primate species. We found that OR genes showed relaxed selective
   constraints in apes (humans, chimpanzees, and orangutans) than in OWMs
   (macaques) and NWMs (marmosets). We concluded that OR gene repertoires
   in primates have evolved in such a way to adapt to their respective
   living environments. Differential selective constraints might play
   important role in the primate OR gene evolution in each primate species.},

Abstract = {Intuitively, any `bag of words' approach in IR should benefit from
   taking term dependencies into account. Unfortunately, for years the
   results of exploiting such dependencies have been mixed or inconclusive.
   To improve the situation, this paper shows how the natural language
   properties of the target documents can be used to transform and enrich
   the term dependencies to more useful statistics. This is clone in three
   steps. The term co-occurrence statistics of queries and documents are
   each represented by a Markov chain. The paper proves that such a chain
   is ergodic, and therefore its asymptotic behavior is unique, stationary,
   and independent of the initial state. Next, the stationary distribution
   is taken to model queries and documents, rather than their initial
   distributions. Finally, ranking is achieved following the customary
   language modeling paradigm. The main contribution of this paper is to
   argue why the asymptotic behavior of the document model is a better
   representation then just the document's initial distribution. A
   secondary contribution is to investigate the practical application of
   this representation in case the queries become increasingly verbose. In
   the experiments (based on Lemur's search engine substrate) the default
   query model was replaced by the stable distribution of the query. Just
   modeling the query this way already resulted in significant improvements
   over a standard language model baseline. The results were on a par or
   better than more sophisticated algorithms that use fine-tuned parameters
   or extensive training. Moreover, the more verbose the query, the more
   effective the approach seems to become.},

   framework {[}5], {[}4] for the preparation and execution of the
   experiments. We ran 69 experiments in the setting of the CLEF 2008 task,
   whereof 39 were monolingual and 30 were cross-lingual. We investigated
   the capabilities of the current version of Xtrieval, which could use the
   two retrieval cores Lucene and Lemur from now on. Our main goal was to
   compare and combine the results from those retrieval engines. The
   translation of the topics for the cross-lingual experiments was realized
   with a plug-in to access the Google AJAX language API. The performance
   of our monolingual experiments was better than the best experiment's we
   submitted during the evaluation campaign. Our cross-lingual experiments
   performed very well for all target collections and achieved between 87\%
   and 100\% of the monolingual retrieval effectiveness. The combination of
   the results from the Lucene and the Lemur retrieval core showed very
   consistent performance.},

   perform concept-related probabilistic inferences using link analysis

Title = {Forelimb proportions and kinematics: how are small primates different
   from other small mammals?},

Pages = {3775-3789},

Abstract = {The crouched limb posture of small mammals enables them to react to
   unexpected irregularities in the support. Small arboreal primates would
   benefit from these kinematics in their arboreal habitat but it has been
   demonstrated that primates display certain differences in forelimb
   kinematics to other mammals. The objective of this paper is to find out
   whether these changes in forelimb kinematics are related to changes in
   body size and limb proportions. As primates descended from small
   ancestors, a comparison between living small primates and other small
   mammals makes it possible to determine the polarity of character
   transformations for kinematic and morphometric features proposed to be
   unique to primates. Walking kinematics of mouse lemurs, brown lemurs,
   cotton-top tamarins and squirrel monkeys was investigated using
   cineradiography. Morphometry was conducted on a sample of 110 mammals
   comprising of primates, marsupials, rodents and carnivores. It has been
   shown that forelimb kinematics change with increasing body size in such
   a way that limb protraction increases but retraction decreases. Total
   forelimb excursion, therefore, is almost independent of body size.
   Kinematic changes are linked to changes in forelimb proportions towards
   greater asymmetry between scapula and radius. Due to the spatial
   restriction inherent in the diagonal footfall sequence of primates,
   forelimb excursion is influenced by the excursion of the elongated hind
   limb. Hindlimb geometry, however, is highly conserved, as has been
   previously shown. The initial changes in forelimb kinematics might,
   therefore, be explained as solutions to a constraint rather than as
   adaptations to the particular demands of arboreal locomotion.},

Title = {Mother-Young Feeding Synchrony and Early Food Selection Differences in

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {29},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1687-1695},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {I tested the hypothesis that mother-young cofeeding correlates with a
   systematic similar food selection in wild Mayotte brown lemurs (Eulemur
   fulvus). I simultaneously recorded the feeding behavior of 4 maternal
   dyad members, from infant birth to weaning, and 10-12 mo of juvenile
   age, during 10-min focal periods, each separated by 5-min intervals over
   10 mo. I recorded the solid food items selected for each feeding
   behavior at the level of specific plant part, along with the distance
   between the 2 individuals. I considered feeding behaviors simultaneous
   (between the young lemurs and their mothers) when the young began to eat
   a food item while the mother was already eating, regardless of the
   separation distance. During their first year, most of the feeding events
   of the young brown lemurs were initiated by their mothers. However,
   infants also selected different food items from those chosen by their
   mothers in almost one-third of cases, and the food selection
   dissimilarity was not attributable to an increase in the distance of
   separation. For juveniles, dissimilar food selection was significantly
   lower and linked to an increase in mother-juvenile separation distance.
   Thus, the substantial proportion of dissimilarity in solid foods
   selected by the infant during the synchronized feeding behaviors
   strongly suggests that social influences were not food-specific and
   might instead drive the acquisition of group feeding activity rhythm
   rather than food selection habits.},

Title = {The antiquity of Madagascar's grasslands and the rise of C-4 grassy
   biomes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},

Abstract = {Aim Grasslands and savannas, which make up > 75\% of Madagascar's land
   area, have long been viewed as anthropogenically derived after people
   settled on the island c. 2 ka. We investigated this hypothesis and an
   alternative - that the grasslands are an insular example of the
   post-Miocene spread of C-4 grassy biomes world-wide.
   Location Madagascar, southern Africa, East Africa.
   Methods We compared the number of C-4 grass genera in Madagascar with
   that in southern and south-central African floras. If the grasslands are
   recent we would expect to find fewer species and genera in Madagascar
   relative to Africa and for these species and genera to have very wide
   distribution ranges in Madagascar. Secondly, we searched Madagascan
   floras for the presence of endemic plant species or genera restricted to
   grasslands. We also searched for evidence of a grassland specialist
   fauna with species endemic to Madagascar. Plant and animal species
   endemic to C-4 grassy biomes would not be expected if these are of
   recent origin.
   Results Madagascar has c. 88 C-4 grass genera, including six endemic
   genera. Excluding African genera with only one or two species,
   Madagascar has 86.6\% of southern Africa's and 89.4\% of south-central
   Africa's grass genera. C-4 grass species make up c. 4\% of the flora of
   both Madagascar and southern Africa and species : genus ratios are
   similar (4.3 and 5.1, respectively). Turnover of grasses along
   geographical gradients follows similar patterns to those in South
   Africa, with Andropogoneae dominating in mesic biomes and Chlorideae in
   semi-arid grassy biomes. At least 16 monocot genera have grassland
   members, many of which are endemic to Madagascar. Woody species in
   frequently burnt savannas include both Madagascan endemics and African
   species. A different woody flora, mostly endemic, occurs in less
   frequently burnt grasslands in the central highlands, filling a similar
   successional niche to montane C-4 grasslands in Africa. Diverse
   vertebrate and invertebrate lineages have grassland specialists,
   including many endemic to Madagascar (e.g. termites, ants, lizards,
   snakes, birds and mammals). Grassland use of the extinct fauna is poorly
   known but carbon isotope analysis indicates that a hippo, two giant
   tortoises and one extinct lemur ate C-4 or CAM (crassulacean acid
   metabolism) plants.
   Main conclusions The diversity of C-4 grass lineages in Madagascar
   relative to that in Africa, and the presence of plant and animal species
   endemic to Madagascan grassy biomes, does not fit the view that these
   grasslands are anthropogenically derived. We suggest that grasslands
   invaded Madagascar after the late Miocene, part of the world-wide
   expansion of C-4 grassy biomes. Madagascar provides an interesting test
   case for biogeographical analysis of how these novel biomes assembled,
   and the sources of the flora and fauna that now occupy them. A necessary
   part of such an analysis would be to establish the pre-settlement extent
   of the C-4 grassy biomes. Carbon isotope analysis of soil organic matter
   would be a feasible method for doing this.},

Abstract = {The antimalarial activity and pharmacology of a series of
   phenylthiazolyl-bearing hydroxamate-based histone deacetylase inhibitors
   (HDACIs) was evaluated. In in vitro growth inhibition assays
   approximately 50 analogs were evaluated against four drug resistant
   strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The range of 50\% inhibitory
   concentrations (IC(50)s) was 0.0005 to > 1 mu M. Five analogs exhibited
   IC(50)s of < 3 nM, and three of these exhibited selectivity indices of >
   600. The most potent compound, WR301801 (YC-2-88) was shown to cause
   hyperacetylation of P. falciparum histones, which is a marker for HDAC
   inhibition in eukaryotic cells. The compound also inhibited malarial and
   mammalian HDAC activity in functional assays at low nanomolar
   concentrations. WR301801 did not exhibit cures in P. berghei-infected
   mice at oral doses as high as 640 mg/kg/day for 3 days or in P.
   falciparum-infected Aotus lemurinus lemurinus monkeys at oral doses of
   32 mg/kg/day for 3 days, despite high relative bioavailability. The
   failure of monotherapy in mice may be due to a short half-life, since
   the compound was rapidly hydrolyzed to an inactive acid metabolite by
   loss of its hydroxamate group in vitro (half-life of 11 min in mouse
   microsomes) and in vivo (half-life in mice of 3.5 h after a single oral
   dose of 50 mg/kg). However, WR301801 exhibited cures in P.
   berghei-infected mice when combined at doses of 52 mg/kg/day orally with
   subcurative doses of chloroquine. Next-generation HDACIs with greater
   metabolic stability than WR301801 may be useful as antimalarials if
   combined appropriately with conventional antimalarial drugs.},

Title = {Long-Term Dynamics of a Fragmented Rainforest Mammal Assemblage},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},

Pages = {1154-1164},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Habitat fragmentation is a severe threat to tropical biotas, but its
   long-term effects are poorly understood. We evaluated longer-term
   changes in the abundance of larger (> 1 kg) mammals in fragmented and
   intact rainforest and in riparian ``corridors{''} in tropical
   Queensland, with data from 190 spotlighting surveys conducted in
   1986-1987 and 2000-2007. In 1986-1987 when most fragments were already
   20-50 years old, mammal assemblages differed markedly between fragmented
   and intact forest. Most vulnerable were lemuroid ringtail possums
   (Hemibelideus lemuroides), followed by Lumboltz's tree-kangaroos
   (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) and Herbert River ringtail possums
   (Pseudocheirus herbertensis). Further changes were evident 20 years
   later. Mammal species richness feel significantly in fragments, and the
   abundances of 4 species, coppery brushtail possums (Trichosurus
   vulpecula johnstoni), green ringtail possums (Pseudochirops archeri)
   red-legged pademelons (Thylogale stigmatica), and tree-kangaroos,
   declined significantly. The most surprising finding was that the
   lemuroid ringtail, a strict rainforest specialist, apparently
   recolonized one fragment, despite a 99.98\% decrease in abundance in
   fragments and corridors. A combination of factors, including long-term
   fragmentation effects, shifts in the surrounding matrix vegetation, and
   recurring cyclone disturbance, appear to underlie these dynamic changes
   in mammal assemblages.},

Title = {Species Specificity in Major Urinary Proteins by Parallel Evolution},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {3},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {Species-specific chemosignals, pheromones, regulate social behaviors
   such as aggression, mating, pup-suckling, territory establishment, and
   dominance. The identity of these cues remains mostly undetermined and
   few mammalian pheromones have been identified. Genetically-encoded
   pheromones are expected to exhibit several different mechanisms for
   coding 1) diversity, to enable the signaling of multiple behaviors, 2)
   dynamic regulation, to indicate age and dominance, and 3)
   species-specificity. Recently, the major urinary proteins (Mups) have
   been shown to function themselves as genetically-encoded pheromones to
   regulate species-specific behavior. Mups are multiple highly related
   proteins expressed in combinatorial patterns that differ between
   individuals, gender, and age; which are sufficient to fulfill the first
   two criteria. We have now characterized and fully annotated the mouse
   Mup gene content in detail. This has enabled us to further analyze the
   extent of Mup coding diversity and determine their potential to encode
   species-specific cues.
   Our results show that the mouse Mup gene cluster is composed of two
   subgroups: an older, more divergent class of genes and pseudogenes, and
   a second class with high sequence identity formed by recent sequential
   duplications of a single gene/pseudogene pair. Previous work suggests
   that truncated Mup pseudogenes may encode a family of functional
   hexapeptides with the potential for pheromone activity. Sequence
   comparison, however, reveals that they have limited coding potential.
   Similar analyses of nine other completed genomes find Mup gene
   expansions in divergent lineages, including those of rat, horse and grey
   mouse lemur, occurring independently from a single ancestral Mup present
   in other placental mammals. Our findings illustrate that increasing
   genomic complexity of the Mup gene family is not evolutionarily
   isolated, but is instead a recurring mechanism of generating coding
   diversity consistent with a species-specific function in mammals.},

Title = {The importance of taboos and social norms to conservation in Madagascar},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {976-986},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Informal institutions governing the use of wild species are present in
   many societies. A system of prohibitions known as fady is central to
   Malagasy culture. We examined whether fady that relate to the use of
   natural resources in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar play an
   important conservation role. Prohibitions ranged from strict taboos in
   which a species or area was forbidden by the ancestors to social norms
   that concerned acceptable behavior when harvesting wild species. Strict
   taboos offered real protection to threatened species, such as the lemur
   Propithecus edwardsi and the carnivore Cryptoprocta ferox. Taboos also
   reduced pressure on some economically important endemic species by
   preventing their sale or limiting the harvest season. Despite their
   value for conservation, the taboos did not appear to originate from
   attempts to sustainably manage resources. Nevertheless, social norms, in
   which the sanction was social disapproval rather than supernatural
   retribution, encouraged sustainable harvesting practices for tenrecs
   (Tenrec ecudatus) and pandans (Pandanus spp.). Unfortunately, the social
   norms concerning methods of harvesting pandans appeared to be breaking
   down in villages surrounding Ranomafana National Park, and we suggest
   that the imposition of external conservation rules is weakening
   traditional management. Informal institutions are important to
   conservation because they suggest ways of improving cultural
   understanding and conservation communication. Food taboos influence
   societal preferences, which affect the wider demand for a species. Most
   important, where capacity to enforce external conservation rules is
   limited, informal institutions may provide the only effective
   regulations. Informal institutions should receive greater attention from
   conservation biologists so that local people's conservation roles can be
   acknowledged fairly and so that potential synergies with conservation
   objectives can be realized.},

Abstract = {Hepatic hemosiderosis is one of the most common postmortem findings in
   captive callitrichid species. Noninvasive evaluation of hematologic iron
   analytes has been used to diagnose hepatic iron storage disease in
   humans, lemurs, and bats. This study evaluated the relationship between
   hematologic iron analyte values (iron, ferritin, total iron binding
   capacity, and percent transferrin saturation) and hepatic hemosiderosis
   in callitrichids at the Wildlife Conservation Society's Central Park and
   Bronx Zoos. Results revealed that both ferritin and percent transferrin
   saturation levels had strong positive correlations with hepatic iron
   concentration (P < 0.001, r = 0.77, n = 20; P < 0.001, r = 0.85, n = 10,
   respectively). Serum iron levels positively correlated with hepatic iron
   concentration (P = 0.06, r = 0.56, n = 11), but this finding was not
   significant. Serum total iron binding capacity did not significantly
   correlate with hepatic iron concentration (P = 0.47, r = 0.25, n = 10).
   Both ferritin and hepatic iron concentration positively correlated with
   severity of hepatic iron deposition on histology (P < 0.05, r = 0.49, n
   = 21; P < 0.001, r = 0.67, n = 21,. respectively). This study suggests
   that ferritin, serum iron concentration, and percent transferrin
   saturation are convenient, noninvasive, antemortem methods for assessing
   severity of hemosiderosis in callitrichids.},

Abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii infections in zoo animals are of interest because many
   captive animals die of clinical toxoplasmosis and because of the
   potential risk of exposure of children and elderly to T. gondii oocysts
   excreted by cats in the zoos. Seroprevalence of T gondii antibodies in
   wild zoo felids, highly susceptible zoo species, and feral cats from 8
   zoos of the midwestern United States was determined by using the
   modified agglutination test (MAT). A titer of 1:25 was considered
   indicative of T gondii exposure. Among wild felids, antibodies to T
   gondii were found in 6 (27.3\%) of 22 cheetahs (Acynonyx
   jubatusjubatus), 2 of 4 African lynx (Caracal caracal), I of 7 clouded
   leopards (Neofelis nebulosa), I of 5 Pallas cats (Otocolobus manul), 12
   (54.5\%) of 22 African lions (Panthera leo), I of I jaguar (Panthera
   onca), I of I Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis), I of I Persian
   leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor), 5 (27.8\%) of 18 Amur tigers
   (Panthera tigris altaica), I of 4 fishing, cats (Prionailurtis
   viverrinus), 3 of 6 pumas (Puma concolor), 2 of 2 Texas pumas (Puma
   concolor stanleyana), and 5 (35.7\%) of 14 snow leopards (Uncia uncia).
   Antibodies were found in 10 of 34 feral domestic cats (Felis domesticus)
   trapped in 3 zoos. Toxoplasma gondii oocysts were not found in any of
   the 78 fecal samples from wild and domestic cats. Among the macropods,
   antibodies were detected in I of 3 Dama wallabies (Macropus eugenii), I
   of I western grey kangaroo (Macropus fidiginosus), I of 2 wallaroos
   (Macropus ro ustus), 6 of 8 Bennett's wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus),
   21 (61.8\%) of 34 red kangaroos (Macropus rufus), and I of I dusky
   pademelon (Thylogale brunii). Among prosimians, antibodies were detected
   in I of T blue-eyed black lemurs (Euleinur macaco flavifrons), I of 21
   ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta), 2 of 9 red-ruffed lemurs (Varecia
   variegata rubra), and 2 of 4 black- and white-ruffed lemurs (Varecia
   variegata variegata). Among the avian species tested. 2 of 3 bald eagles
   (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) were seropositive. Among 7 possible risk
   factors, sex, freezing meat temperature (above - 13 C vs. below - 13 Q,
   washing vegetables thoroughly, frequency of feral cat sightings on zoo
   grounds (occasionally vs. frequently), frequency of feral cat control
   programs, capability of feral cats to enter hay/grain barn, and type of
   animal exhibit, exhibiting animals in open enclosures was the only
   factor identified as a significant risk (OR 3.22, P = 0.00).},

Abstract = {Intense cyclones might be expected to adversely affect populations of
   arboreal mammals, either directly or as a consequence of the destruction
   of food resources and other key habitat elements. However, such impacts
   have rarely been quantified. The present study examined the response of
   five species of arboreal folivorous marsupials to Severe Cyclone Larry
   at nine sites in upland rainforests of the Atherton Tableland,
   north-east Australia. Sites were originally surveyed for folivores in
   1995-1997, and then resurveyed in 2006, 6-8 months after Cyclone Larry
   had traversed the region. All sites showed evidence of structural damage
   to vegetation, but overall damage levels (assessed in terms of canopy
   cover, damage to trees, basal area of dead trees and volume of woody
   debris) decreased from east to west across the study region. The
   detectability of rainforest possums increased after the cyclone. For the
   most commonly observed species, the proportion of individuals observed >
   5 m from survey transects was correlated with the amount of structural
   damage to vegetation. To avoid confounding changes in detectability with
   changes in abundance, only observations close (< 5 m) to transects were
   used to estimate folivore abundance before and after the cyclone. On
   this basis, there were no significant differences between pre- and
   post-cyclone abundance estimates for any folivore species. Further,
   changes in folivore abundance after the cyclone were not correlated with
   damage to vegetation across sites. Cyclone Larry does not appear to have
   caused a catastrophic loss of key habitat resources for marsupial
   folivores at the sites surveyed. The high degree of folivory practiced
   by marsupial folivores may help make them resilient to cyclone impacts.
   These conclusions are more robust for three commonly observed folivore
   species (Hemibelideus lemuroides, Pseudochirulus herbertensis and
   Trichosurus vulpecula johnstonii) than for two less frequently
   encountered species (Pseudochirops archeri and Dendrolagus lumholtzi).},

Organization = {Primate Soc Great Britain},
Abstract = {Primates are quite unique among placental mammals in that the two
   extreme types of placentation are present within a single order.
   Strepsirrhines (lemurs and lorisiforms) have non-invasive
   epitheliochorial placentation, whereas haplorhines (tarsiers and higher
   primates) have highly invasive haemochorial placentation. Resemblance in
   placenta type in fact provided the first evidence that tarsiers are
   linked to higher primates and distinct from lemurs and lorisiforms.
   Tree-shrews differ from both primate subgroups in having moderately
   invasive endotheliochorial placentation, while colugos have invasive
   haemochorial placentation like haplorhines. All three kinds of
   placentation have been identified as primitive for placentals by
   different authors, but until recently the prevailing interpretation has
   been that non-invasive epitheliochorial placentation is primitive and
   ``less efficient{''}. Opposing this interpretation, Martin (Primate
   origins and evolution: a phylogenetic reconstruction, 1990) proposed
   that moderately invasive endotheliochorial placentation is primitive.
   Epitheliochorial placentation is unlikely to be primitive because it is
   predominantly associated with large body size, relatively long gestation
   periods and precocial offspring. Furthermore, some strepsirrhines and
   other placental mammals with epitheliochorial placentation retain
   indications of former invasiveness of the placenta. The recent
   availability of comprehensive molecular phylogenies for placental
   mammals has provided an independent framework to determine the most
   parsimonious interpretation of the evolution of placenta types and other
   reproductive features. It has consistently emerged that epitheliochorial
   placentation is best explained as a derived condition, although opinions
   differ as to whether the ancestral condition for placental mammals (and
   hence for primates) was endotheliochorial or haemochorial. It is argued
   that on balance the most likely ancestral condition is
   endotheliochorial. Comparative evidence across placentals clearly
   indicates that epitheliochorial placentation is not less efficient than
   more invasive forms of placentation, at least with respect to growth in
   overall fetal body mass. The ratio of neonate mass to gestation period
   (a simple indicator of average daily maternal investment in fetal
   growth) shows no difference according to placenta type. Differential
   evolution of placentation is hence presumably linked to immunological
   factors, parent/offspring conflict and/or genomic imprinting.},

Abstract = {Lamb contains high saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. Consuming such
   meat tends to increase atherosclerosis incident. Fat content and
   composition of meat might be manipulated by giving lemuru fish oil which
   is rich in HDL and unsaturated fatty acids into sheep diet. Giving
   lemuru fish oil in the protected form, such as complex calcium-soap is
   believed to be more beneficial. Twelve sheep were distributed into four
   groups to receive four experimental diets in studying the influence of
   calcium soap on meat quality. The sheep were allocated based on
   Randomized Block Design and at the end of rearing period they were
   slaughtered. The experimental diets were: R0 = control diet, R1 = R0 +
   1.5\% calcium soap, R2 = R0 + 3\% calcium soap and R3 = R0 + 4.5\%
   calcium soap. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and any
   significant differences were further tested using contrast orthogonal.
   The results showed that the treatments significantly (P<0.01) reduced
   fat content, both of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and high
   density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) of sheep meat. There were no
   differences in tendernes, cooking loss, water holding capacity (WHC) and
   pH of meat. It is concluded that the best level of Ca-soap fish oil
   addition to yield healthy meat is 3\%.},

   cyclone},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {Severe tropical cyclones greatly modify habitat of arboreal folivores by
   destroying forest canopy, reducing structure and complexity and
   defoliating remaining trees. We hypothesized that forest modification
   following severe Cyclone Larry would stress arboreal folivores of the
   Family Pseudocheiridae and be reflected in increased home ranges and a
   decrease in body condition. We conducted 19 pre-cyclone and 24
   post-cyclone spotlighting surveys at a site with severe cyclone damage,
   and 18 post-cyclone surveys at a site with minor damage. We detected a
   greater number of lemuroid, Hemibelideus lemuroides and green,
   Pseudochirops archeri, ringtail possums as these possums remained in the
   severely damaged canopy and forest edge. In contrast, Herbert River
   ringtail possums, Pseudochirulus herbertensis, were detected in smaller
   numbers. We radio-tracked eight P. herbertensis before the cyclone,
   following two of these and nine new animals after the category 4
   cyclone. No significant post-cyclone alteration in home range area or
   span was recorded in data pooled across the two sites or in limited
   post-cyclone data at the severely disturbed site, but a greater
   variability in home range was observed after cyclone (pooled across
   sites: 1.72 +/- 0.77 ha; 197 +/- 47 m) than before the cyclone (1.35 +/-
   0.30 ha; 196 +/- 23 m). In contrast, pooled pre- and post-cyclone home
   range areas and spans were larger at the severely-disturbed site (2.08
   +/- 0.56 ha; 231 +/- 32 m) than at the site with minor damage (0.68 +/-
   0.11 ha; 114 +/- 25 m), suggesting resources were more widely spread at
   the former site. Post-cyclone home ranges were also larger at the
   severely damaged site (severe: 3.33 +/- 1.36 ha, n = 3; minor: 0.52 +/-
   0.07 ha, n = 4). Condition of P. herbertensis (mass/tail length) did not
   differ significantly pre- and post-cyclone or between less and severely
   disturbed sites. These results and observations of breeding after
   cyclone suggest that possum populations may be resilient to severe
   cyclone damage under the relatively wet conditions experienced
   post-Cyclone Larry.},

Abstract = {Adaptive radiations of mammals have contributed to the exceptionally
   high levels of biodiversity and endemism in Madagascar. Here we examine
   the evolutionary history of the endemic dung beetle tribe
   Helictopleurini (Scarabaeidae) and its relationship to the widely
   distributed Oniticellini and Onthophagini. Helictopleurini species are
   dependent on mammals for their resources. We date the single origin of
   the tribe, at 37 to 23 MY ago, indicating overseas colonization of
   Madagascar. The main radiation occurred concurrently with the main
   radiations of lemurs. The ancestors of Helictopleurini are inferred to
   have been coprophagous species inhabiting open habitats. Subsequent
   evolution has involved a shift into forests, changes in resource use to
   a more generalized diet, and changes in body size. Four species of the
   extant 65 species have shifted to use the dung of the recently
   introduced cattle in open habitats, allowing these species to greatly
   expand their geographical ranges. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Myosin VI is involved in a wide range of endocytic and exocytic membrane
   trafficking pathways; clathrin-mediated endocytosis, intracellular
   transport of clathrin-coated and -uncoated vesicles, AP-1B-dependent
   basolateral sorting in polarized epithelial cells and secretion from the
   Golgi complex to the cell surface. In this study, using a yeast
   two-hybrid screen, we identified brain-enriched kinase/lemur tyrosine
   kinase 2 (BREK/LMTK2), a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase with
   previously unknown cellular functions, as a myosin VI-interacting
   protein. Several binding experiments confirmed the interaction of myosin
   VI with BREK in vivo and in vitro. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed
   that BREK localizes to cytoplasmic membrane vesicles and to perinuclear
   recycling endosomes. Notably, cells in which BREK was depleted by siRNA
   were still able to internalize transferrin molecules and to transport
   them to early endosomes, but were unable to transport them to
   perinuclear recycling endosomes. Our results show that BREK is critical
   for the transition of endocytosed membrane vesicles from early endosomes
   to recycling endosomes and also suggest an involvement of myosin VI in
   this pathway.},

Title = {Chimerism, point mutation, and truncation dramatically transformed mast
   cell delta-tryptases during primate evolution},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {121},
Number = {5},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: Tryptases are serine peptidases stored in mast cell
   granules. Rodents express 2 soluble tryptases, mast cell proteases
   (MCPs) 6 and 7. Human alpha- and beta-tryptases are orthologs of MCP-6.
   However, much of the ancestral MCP-7 ortholog was replaced by parts of
   other tryptases, creating chimeric delta-tryptase. Human
   delta-tryptase's limited activity is hypothesized to be due to
   truncation and processing mutations.
   Objective: We sought to probe the origins and consequences of mutations
   in primate delta-tryptases.
   Methods: Prosimian (lemur), monkey (macaque), great ape (orangutan,
   gorilla, and chimpanzee), and human delta-tryptase genes were identified
   by means of data mining and genomic sequencing. Resulting genes were
   analyzed phylogenetically and structurally.
   Results: The seminal conversion event generating the delta-tryptase
   chimera occurred early because all primates studied contain
   delta-tryptase genes. Truncation, resulting from a nonsense mutation of
   Trp206, occurred much later, after orangutans and other great apes last
   shared an ancestor. The Arg-3Gln propeptide mutation occurred most
   recently, being present in humans and chimpanzees but not in other
   primates. Surprisingly, the major active tryptase in monkeys is
   full-length delta-tryptase, not beta-tryptase, which is the main active
   tryptase in human subjects. Models of macaque delta-tryptase reveal that
   the segment truncated in human subjects contains antiparallel
   beta-strands coursing through the substrate-binding cleft, accounting
   for truncation's drastic effect on activity.
   Conclusions: Transformations in the ancestral MCP-7-like gene during
   primate evolution caused dramatic variations in function. Although
   delta-tryptases are nearly inactive in humans, they are active and
   dominant in monkeys.},

Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive form of dementia
   in the elderly. Two major neuropathological hallmarks of AD include
   cerebral deposition of amyloid-beta protein (A beta) into plaques and
   blood vessels, and the presence of neurofibrillary tangles in brain. In
   addition, activated microglia and reactive astrocytes are often
   associated with plaques and tangles. Numerous other proteins are
   associated with plaques in human AD brain, including Apo E and
   ubiquitin. The amyloid precursor protein and its shorter fragment, A
   beta, are homologous between humans and non-human primates. Cerebral A
   beta deposition has been reported previously for rhesus monkeys,
   vervets, squirrel monkeys, marmosets, lemurs, cynomologous monkeys,
   chimpanzees, and orangutans. Here we report, for the first time,
   age-related neuropathological changes in cotton-top tamarins (CTT,
   Saguinus oedipus), an endangered non-human primate native to the
   rainforests of Colombia and Costa Rica. Typical lifespan is 13-14 years
   of age in the wild and 15-20+ Years in captivity. We performed detailed
   immunohistochemical analyses of A beta deposition and associated
   pathogenesis in archived brain sections from 36 tamarins ranging in age
   from 6-21 years. A beta plaque deposition was observed in 16 of the 20
   oldest tamarins (>12 years). Plaques contained mainly A beta 42, and in
   the oldest animals, were associated with reactive astrocytes, activated
   microglia, Apo E, and ubiquitin-positive dystrophic neurites, similar to
   human plaques. Vascular A beta was detected in 14 of the 20 aged
   tamarins; A beta 42 preceded A beta 40 deposition. Phospho-tau labeled
   dystrophic neurites and tangles, typically present in human AD, were
   absent in the tamarins. In conclusion, tamarins may represent a model of
   early AD pathology.},

   Dypsis include thin-walled, tannin-filled fibers around the vascular
   bundles. Large-fruited members of the presumably related genera
   Lemurophoenix, Masoala, and Marojejya show more distinctive arrangements
   of protective tissues and are quite different from one another. Only
   Marojejya appears to be closely related to Dypsis. Lemurophoenix and
   Masoala, by possession of both unsheathed vascular bundles and bundles
   with heavy fibrous sheaths, show possible affinities with genera

Abstract = {Recent survey of the fossiliferous variegated mudstones of the PK1
   locality (Sabapondaung) in the late middle Eocene Pondaung Formation
   (central Myanmar) has led to the recovery of a partial right innominate
   of a relatively large-bodied primate. Given its size and provenance,
   this bone probably belongs to the same individual represented by the
   NMMP 20 primate partial skeleton described previously from the same
   locality. The new fossil, which preserves the region around the
   acetabulum and the adjacent part of the ilium, clearly exhibits
   strepsirrhine rather than anthropoid affinities. This addition to our
   knowledge of the NMMP 20 partial skeleton allows us to reassess the
   different locomotor interpretations that have been proposed for this
   specimen. Aspects of pelvic morphology suggest that the NMMP 20 partial
   skeleton documents a primate that probably engaged in active arboreal
   quadrupedalism similar to that practiced by medium-sized Malagasy
   lemurids rather than lorislike slow moving and climbing. Given the
   conflicting phylogenetic signals provided by NMMP 39 (a talus showing
   anthropoid affinities) and NMMP 20 (a partial skeleton bearing adapiform
   affinities), it appears that two higher-level taxonomic groups of
   relatively large-bodied primates are documented in the Pondaung
   Formation. The recent discovery of two taxa of sivaladapid adapiforms
   from the Pondaung Formation indicates that the assumption that the NMMP
   20 partial skeleton belongs to an amphipithecid can no longer be
   sustained. Instead, this specimen apparently documents a third
   large-bodied sivaladapid species in the Pondaung Formation. (c) 2007

Abstract = {We test the hypothesis that the fused interfrontal suture of anthropoids
   is a uniquely distinguishing feature and a derived characteristic
   indicative of their monophyletic origin. Our survey of nonanthropoid
   primates and several archontan families indicates frontal fusion is
   widespread. It is most variable (fused, open or partially fused) inter-
   and intra-specifically among strepsirhines. The frontal bone is more
   commonly fused in living lemuroids and indrioids than among lorisoids.
   It appears to be fused regularly among Eocene adapids. Among
   nonanthropoid haplorhines, the interfrontal is fused in Tarsius, even in
   neonates and invariably in adults, probably also in all fossil
   tarsiiforms preserving the frontal bone, and in the late Eocene
   protoanthropoid Rooneyia. The plesiadapiform pattern remains uncertain,
   but fusion is ubiquitous among living tree shrews, colugos and bats.
   Distributional evidence implies that interfrontal fusion was present in
   the last common ancestor (LCA) of haplorhine primates and possibly in
   the LCA of euprimates as well. Anthropoids, therefore, cannot be defined
   cladistically by interfrontal fusion, not out of concern for homoplasy
   but because it is probably a primitive feature inherited from other taxa
   related to anthropoids. Fusion of the large anthropoid frontal bone,
   which was extended anteriorly to roof the orbits and expanded laterally
   in connection with a wide forebrain in the LCA of anthropoids and
   protoanthropoids, may have been preadaptive to the evolution of the
   postorbital septum. The zygomatico-frontal suture of the septum may
   provide an alternative mechanism for dissipating the calvarial strains
   of mastication formerly taken up by an open interfrontal suture.},

Title = {Neocentromeres. II. molecular factors required for formation of
   centromere and neocentromere},
Journal = {POSTEPY BIOLOGII KOMORKI},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {273-285},
Abstract = {Contrary to endogenous centromeres containing the species-specific
   tandem repeated DNA arrays, the neocentromeres are formed on DNA
   sequences without tandem arrays, therefore DNA does not decide about a
   neocentromere identity, and epigenetic mechanisms have an essential role
   in neocentromere assembly. The transposable elements are the most
   abundant class of DNA in higher Eukaryota. LTR retrotransposons are
   present both in centromeric and pericentromeric heterochromatin in the
   endogenous centromeric region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation data
   indicate that the key proteins for the centromere assembly, CENP-A/CENH3
   interact with retroelements. It is possible that, even single copy,
   retroelements could be the first mark for the site of a future
   neocentromere. Overexpression of CID (CENP-A homologue in Drosophila)
   results its mislocalization, i.e. the presence in normally
   noncentromeric chromosome region. Several disturbances of mitosis (e. g.
   chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy) indicate that these ectopic
   neocentromeres induce active multicentromere chromosomes. Mechanism that
   prevents deposition of CID out of endogenous centromeres consists in
   proteolysis of soluble CENP-A, not incorporated into centromeric
   chromatin nucleosomes. Nucleosomal location of the centromere-specific
   variant of historic H3, CENP-A and its homologues is necessary for the
   assembly of other centromeric and kinetochore proteins. Studies
   performed recently with fusion protein CENP-A or its homologues -
   GFP/YFP/EYEP gave precise information concerning the time of synthesis
   organisms (mammalians and angiosperm plant species), synthesis and
   loading of CENP-A/CENH3 occur mainly in G2 faze, but even in the same
   type of cells, HeLa, maximum expression and CENP-A loading were shown to
   take place, depending on the authors, either in G2 or during telophase
   and G1 phase. In yeast these processes occur in S and G2 phase, while in
   Drosophila - during S phase. Therefore, the synthesis and loading of
   CENP-A and its homologues should take place during interphase before the
   onset of mitosis with chromosome bearing a neocentromere. In human,
   Drosophila, yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana cells it has been shown that
   histone-fold domain is required for centromere-specific deposition of
   CENP-A and its homologues. The C-terminal parts of these proteins are
   responsible for the recognition of centromeres. This region, CENP-A
   targeting domain (CATD) includes the L1 linker and alpha 2 helix of
   CENP-A and is sufficient to direct this protein to centromeres, even
   when its N-terminal (species-specific) tail is absent. Heterochromatin
   is an integral part of the centromere region. It is present at the
   centromere itself and in the pericentromeric region flanking it. In
   endogenous centromeres both kinds of heterochromatin display the
   epigenetic DNA and histone modifications characteristic of condensed and
   transcriptionally inactive chromatin, i.e. cytosine methylation in DNA,
   methylation of lysine 9 and 27 in the historic H3, methylation of lysine
   20 in the histone H4, absence of acetylation of the latter two.
   Moreover, heterochromatin of the centromeric region contains HP I
   protein. In endogenous centromeres in human cells mutation of DNA
   methyltransferase gene results in decreased methylation of centromeric
   DNA and in several disturbances in sister chromatid separation during
   mitosis.
   The amount of heterochromatin at neocentromeres formed on euchromatin
   bands in chromosomes is reduced as compared to endogenous centromeres,
   although some epigenetic marks characteristic of heterochromatin and he
   presence of HP I have been observed. These modifications do not occur in
   those domains in neocentromere region that contain coding DNA sequences.
   The role of cohesion is to establish sister chromatid cohesion. It is
   generally admitted that in higher Eukaryota cohesin is preferentially
   bound by heterochromatic parts of chromatin just after DNA replication
   and chromatin restitution. During mitosis the last disappearing part of
   cohesin is that bound to pricentromeric heterochromatin. Reduction of
   sister chromatids cohesion as a result of diminished amount of
   pricentromeric heterochromatin in some human neocentromeres has been
   observed. It has to be noted that recent results suggest possibility of
   cohesion binding to euchromatic parts of chromatin. Some data obtained
   from the studies on chromosome evolution can facilitate understanding of
   neocentromere formation. Chromosome rearrangements are known as
   mechanisms that contribute to the changes of chromosome shape and of
   centromere position, e. g. in rare de novo formation of centromeres on
   acentric chromosome fragments. A particular role in centromere evolution
   has been attributed to transposable elements, as they have an important
   role in initiating heterochromatin formation from a single-copy domain
   at an euchromatic region. The location of a centromere and its
   inactivation or activation can change during evolution. Centromere
   repositioning occurred, among others, in mammalian X chromosome. The
   centromeres of X chromosome in two lemur species and in human are
   located in different positions and contain different DNA repeats.
   Therefore, centromere repositioning may due to the endogenous centromere
   inactivation/neocentromere formation. The presence of active genes in
   centromere 8 region in rice and in some human neocentromeres may
   indicate their relatively recent formation. Up to now, there are only
   few data concerning the question of why a neocentromere originates in a
   particular - both heterochromatic as euchromatic - location and what,
   besides endogenous centromere inactivation, triggers their formation.},

Abstract = {The subfamily Aleocharinae is a large group) of Staphylinidae beetles
   represented by many genera and a large number of species in all
   zoogeographical regions. The taxonomy of this group is rather difficult
   and relies heavily on the characters of the male copulatory organ and of
   the spermatheca. In the present Study, additional new data for several
   Malagasy Aleocharinae and new species arc presented. The material
   studied comes from the Jarrige collection. Eight tribes (Corotocini,
   Hypocyphtini, Leucocraspedini, Pronomaeini, Gyrophaenini, Homalotini,
   Diestotini and Oxypodinini), 16 genera (millotoca, Oligota,
   Leucocraspedum, Myllaena, Tomoxelia, Nopromaea, Bryothinusa, Gyrophaena,
   Brachida, Neobrachida, Placusa, Homalota, Neosilusa, Coenonica, Diestota
   and Heterotaxus) and 45 species are recognized. Nineteen species are
   described as new to science, seven of the genus Myllaena (M.
   anjavidilavensis n. sp., M. microptera n. sp., M. lemuriana n. sp., M.
   maroantsetrensis n. sp., M. muscicola n. sp., M. lemuriana n. sp. and M.

   Bryothinusa (B. madecassa n. sp.), one of sp.). one of the genus
   Gyrophaena (G. insularis n. sp.), one of the genus Brachida (B. hova n.
   sp.), three of the genus Placusa (P. malgascia n. sp., P. madecassa n.
   sp. and P. convexa n. sp.), one of the genus Homalota (H. antongilicola
   n. sp.) one of the genus Coenonica (C. incisa n. sp.) and two of the
   genus Heterotaxus (H. pauliani n. sp. and H. malgascius n. sp.). The
   genus Oligusa Wasmann, 1897 is placed in synonymy with Oligota
   Mannertheim, 1831. New combination is proposed for Oligusa
   crematogastris wasmann, 1897. The genus Bryothinusa is recorded from
   Madagascar for the first time. The female has been recovered, first
   unknown, for one species (Tomoxelia andohahela Pace, 1999) and here for
   the first time the spermatheca is illustrated. Each new species is
   described and illustrated. All available distributional data arc
   presented. With the present study the number of the Aleocharinae species
   from Madagascar is of 494 of which 474 are endemic.},

Title = {Avoiding commitment: cathemerality among primates},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {213-228},
Abstract = {Cathemeral animals distribute their activity more or less uniformly
   between the dark and light phases of the 24-hour day. This activity
   pattern is quite widely observed among major mammal taxa, although the
   number of species involved is relatively low. Among primates,
   cathemerality is seen principally, though not uniquely, in the
   strepsirhine ({''}lower primate{''}) family Lemuridae; it is ubiquitous
   in the genus Eulemur, among species of which it seems to be a stable
   activity pattern with a history going back at least 8-12 million years.
   Nocturnal primates have visual systems that accentuate sensitivity to
   light over visual acuity, showing large cornea size, high rod:cone
   ratios and large numbers of photoreceptors relative to ganglion cells.
   Diurnal forms do the reverse, while Eulemur species are intermediate in
   these respects, suggesting substantial accommodation of the visual
   system to the cathemeral lifestyle. Studies of one Eulemur species have
   revealed that its cathemerality is underpinned by a robust endogenous
   circadian timing mechanism with a free-running periodicity of over 25
   hours. The lemurs appear to be entrained to the 24-hour day by the
   light/dark cycle, plausibly with dusk as the primary zeitgeber. The
   causes of cathemerality have been sought in such environmental
   influences as predator avoidance, energy conservation, dietary quality,
   and interspecies feeding competition. All of these factors seem to be
   relevant to the cathemeral lifestyle, but none appears to be a crucial
   determinant. Nothing is known of the underlying neural mechanisms that
   facilitate the lemurs' accommodation to the extremes to which 24-hour
   activity exposes them.},

Abstract = {Myosin VI is an actin-based retrograde motor protein that plays a
   crucial role in both endocytic and secretory membrane trafficking
   pathways. Myosin VI's targeting to and function in these intracellular
   pathways is mediated by a number of specific binding partners. In this
   paper we have identified a new myosin-VI-binding partner, lemur tyrosine
   kinase 2 (LMTK2), which is the first transmembrane protein and kinase
   that directly binds to myosin VI. LMTK2 binds to the WWY site in the
   C-terminal myosin VI tail, the same site as the endocytic adaptor
   protein Dab2. When either myosin VI or LMTK2 is depleted by siRNAs, the
   transferrin receptor (TfR) is trapped in swollen endosomes and tubule
   formation in the endocytic recycling pathway is dramatically reduced,
   showing that both proteins are required for the transport of cargo, such
   as the TfR, from early endosomes to the endocytic recycling compartment.},

   extracted from the brown lemur Eulemur fulvus, in only two short rounds
   of PCR. Where the genomic structure and sequence is known, this
   technique may be universally applied to any, gene expressed in any

Title = {Divergent expression of cellular prion protein on blood cells of human

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Four recent transmissions of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
   disease infection by transfusion highlight the need for detailed
   understanding of blood-related prion pathogenesis. Nonhuman primates are
   the most relevant models of human prion diseases.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Quantitative flow cytometry with monoclonal
   antibodies FH11, 3F4, and 6H4 against different parts of the normal
   cellular form of the prion protein (PrPC) was used to evaluate its
   expression on blood cells of humans, chimpanzees, cynomolgus macaques,
   rhesus macaques, squirrel monkeys, and microcebe lemurs.
   RESLUTS: Chimpanzees, rhesus macaques, and squirrel monkeys displayed a
   much higher quantity of total blood cell membrane PrPC than humans, due
   to a markedly higher expression of PrPC on their red blood cells (RBCs).
   In contrast, cynomolgus macaques and lemurs demonstrated substantially
   lower levels of membrane PrPC due to the lack of significant PrPC
   expression on RBCs and platelets (PLTs). All species displayed PrPC on
   white blood cells (WBCs), with the highest levels found on human cells.
   Only humans, chimpanzees, and to a lesser degree rhesus macaques
   expressed PrPC on PLTs.
   CONCLUSIONS: If PrPC contributes to the propagation or transport of
   prion infectivity in blood, the differences reported here need to be
   considered when extrapolating results of transmission studies in primate
   models to blood and blood components in humans.},

Title = {Ocular oxyspirurosis of primates in zoos: Intermediate host, worm
   morphology, and probable origin of the infection in the Moscow zoo},
Journal = {PARASITE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {287-298},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Over the last century, only two cases of ocular oxyspirurosis were
   recorded in primates, both in zoos, and two species were described: in
   Berlin, Germany, Oxyspirura (O.) conjunctivalis from the lemurid
   Microcebus murinus, later also found in the lorisid Loris gracilis, in
   Jacksonville, Florida, O. (O.) youngi from the cercopithecid monkey
   Erythrocebus patas. In the present case from the Moscow zoo,
   oxyspirurosis was recorded in several species of Old World lemuriforms
   end lorisiforms, and some South American monkeys. i) The intermediate
   host was discovered to be a cockroach, as for O. (O.) mansoni, a
   parasite of poultry. The complete sequence identity between ITS-1 rDNA
   from adult nematodes of the primate and that of the larval worms from
   the vector, Nauphoete cinerea, confirmed their conspecificity. ii)
   Parasites from Moscow zoo recovered from Nycticebus c. coucang were
   compared morphologically to those from other zoos. The length and shape
   of the gubernaculum, used previously as a distinct character, were found
   to be variable. However, the vulvar bosses arrangement, the distal
   extremity of left spicule and the position of papillae of the first
   postcloacal pair showed that the worms in the different samples were not
   exactly identical and that each set seemed characteristic of a
   particular zoo. iii) The presence of longitudinal cuticular crests in
   the infective stage as well as in adult worms was recorded. Together
   with several other morphological and biological characters (long tail
   and oesophagus, cockroach vector), this confirmed that Oxyspirura is not
   closely related to Thelazia, another ocular parasite genus. iv) The
   disease in the Moscow zoo is thought to have started with Nycticebus
   pygmaeus imported from Vietnam, thus the suggestion was that Asiatic
   lorisids were at the origin of the Moscow set of cases. The natural
   host(s) for the Berlin and Jacksonville cases remain unknown but they
   are unlikely to be the species found infected in zoos. Consequently the
   notion of type hosts is artificial and the three agents of oxyspirurosis
   are provisionally placed in the taxon O. (O.) conjunctivalis.},

Title = {Calbindin D-28K protein cells in a primate suprachiasmatic nucleus:
   localization, daily rhythm and age-related changes},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {26},
Number = {7},
Pages = {2025-2032},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the
   master circadian pacemaker. The SCN controls daily rhythms and
   synchronizes the organism to its environment and especially to photic
   signals. Photic signals via the retinohypothalamic tract reach the
   ventral part of the SCN, where the majority of calbindin-containing
   neurons are located. Calbindin cells seem important for the control of
   circadian rhythmicity. As ageing leads to marked changes in the
   expression of circadian rhythms, we investigated in the mouse lemur, a
   nocturnal primate, age-related changes in the oscillation of calbindin
   protein expression in SCN neurons. We used immunohistochemistry and
   quantitative analysis of calbindin expression in the SCN of adult and
   aged mouse lemurs. In this primate, a dense cluster of
   calbindin-positive neurons was found in the ventral part of the SCN. In
   adult animals, calbindin-positive SCN neurons did not exhibit daily
   rhythms in their number or intensity, but exhibited significant daily
   variations in the percentage of cells with a calbindin-positive nucleus,
   characterized by high values during the daytime and low values during
   the night. Immunoreactive intensity peaked in the middle of the daytime.
   Calbindin expression in the nuclei of calbindin cells in the SCN tends
   to be modified by ageing. The amplitude of daily variation in calbindin
   expression was damped, with a lower immunointensity during the daytime
   and a delayed decrease during the night. These changes may affect the
   ability of the SCN to transmit rhythmic information to other SCN cells
   and thereby modify the synchronization of the different cell populations
   in the SCN.},

Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1},
Pages = {272-288},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Ceroxyloideae is a small but heterogeneous subfamily of palms
   (Arecaceae, Palmae). It includes a Caribbean lineage (tribe
   Cyclospathae), a southern hemisphere disjunction (tribe Ceroxyleae), and
   an amphi-Andean element (tribe Phytelepheae), until recently considered
   a distinct subfamily (Phytelephantoideae) due to its highly derived
   morphology. A variety of hypotheses have been proposed to account for
   the biogeography of the subfamily, involving Gondwanan vicariance,
   austral interplate dispersal from South America to Australia via
   Antarctica, Andean orogeny, and Pleistocene refuges. We assessed the
   systematic classification and biogeography of the group based on a
   densely sampled phylogeny using > 5.5 kb of DNA sequences from three
   plastid and two nuclear genomic regions. The subfamily and each of its
   three tribes were resolved as monophyletic with high support. Divergence
   time estimates based on penalized likelihood and Bayesian dating methods
   indicate that Gondwanan vicariance is highly unlikely as an explanation
   for basic disjunctions in tribe Ceroxyleae. Alternative explanations
   include a mid-Tertiary trans-Atlantic/trans-African dispersal track and
   the ``lemurian stepping stones{''} hypothesis. Austral interplate
   dispersal of Oraniopsis to Australia could have occurred, but apparently
   only in the mid-Eocene/early Oligocene interval after global cooling had
   begun. Our data do not support Pleistocene climatic changes as drivers
   for speciation in the Andean-centered Phytelepheae as previously
   proposed. Radiation in this tribe coincides largely with the major
   uplift of the Andes, favoring Andean orogeny over Pleistocene climatic
   changes as a possible speciation-promoting factor in this tribe. (c)

Title = {Degeneration of the Olfactory Guanylyl Cyclase D Gene during Primate
   Evolution},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {2},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {Background. The mammalian olfactory system consists of several
   subsystems that detect specific sets of chemical cues and underlie a
   variety of behavioral responses. Within the main olfactory epithelium at
   least three distinct types of chemosensory neurons can be defined by
   their expression of unique sets of signal transduction components. In
   rodents, one set of neurons expresses the olfactory-specific guanylyl
   cyclase (GC)-D gene (Gucy2d, guanylyl cyclase 2d) and other cell-type
   specific molecules. GC-D-positive neurons project their axons to a small
   group of atypical ``necklace{''} glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, some
   of which are activated in response to suckling in neonatal rodents and
   to atmospheric CO2 in adult mice. Because GC-D is a pseudogene in
   humans, signaling through this system appears to have been lost at some
   point in primate evolution. Principal Findings. Here we used a
   combination of bioinformatic analysis of trace-archive and
   genome-assembly data and sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA to
   determine when during primate evolution the functional gene was lost.
   Our analysis reveals that GC-D is a pseudogene in a large number of
   primate species, including apes, Old World and New World monkeys and
   tarsier. In contrast, the gene appears intact and has evolved under
   purifying selection in mouse, rat, dog, lemur and bushbaby. Conclusions.
   These data suggest that signaling through GC-D-expressing cells was
   probably compromised more than 40 million years ago, prior to the
   divergence of New World monkeys from Old World monkeys and apes, and
   thus cannot be involved in chemosensation in most primates.},

Abstract = {We surveyed the calcareous massif Montagne des Francais in northern
   Madagascar for amphibians and reptiles. We recorded nine amphibian and
   52 reptile species by direct sampling and pitfall trapping in the first
   detailed survey to focus on this area. Consequently 78.7\% of the
   species found were new records for Montagne des Francais. The majority
   of species (60.7\%) were only found in relatively undisturbed areas of
   forest with diversity peaking at 100-200 m elevation. The most
   threatened elements of this herpetofauna are the eight species that
   appear to be locally endemic: Amphiglossus sp. nov., Brookesia sp. nov.,
   Heteroliodon fohy, Liophidium cf. therezieni, Bibilava martae,
   Madagascarophis sp. nov., Paroedura sp. and Paroedura lohatsara (3-5 of
   which are undescribed). An additional 28 species are regional endemics,
   two species are listed as vulnerable on the 2006 Red List of Threatened
   Species and 14 species are listed on the CITES appendices. We further
   emphasize the conservation importance of this massif by documenting the
   presence of four threatened species of lemur that have not previously
   been recorded from Montagne des Francais. This paper contributes to the
   current understanding of Malagasy patterns of biodiversity by
   documenting the composition, geographical, seasonal and ecological
   distribution of the herpetofauna found at this calcareous limestone
   massif. Located approximately 12 km from the town of Antsiranana, this
   important biological center of endemism is subject to numerous
   human-induced environmental problems and should, therefore, be
   considered a high conservation priority. We strongly suggest that the
   area be fully included into the system of protected areas in Madagascar.},

Title = {High diversity in functional properties of melanocortin 1 receptor
   (MC1R) in divergent primate species is more strongly associated with
   phylogeny than coat color},

Abstract = {We have characterized the biochemical function of the melanocortin 1
   receptor (MC1R), a critical regulator of melanin synthesis, from 9
   phylogenetically diverse primate species with varying coat colors. There
   is substantial diversity in melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) binding
   affinity and basal levels of activity in the cloned MC1Rs. MSH binding
   was lost independently in lemur and New World monkey lineages, whereas
   high basal levels of MC1R activity occur in lemurs and some New World
   monkeys and Old World monkeys. Highest levels of basal activity were
   found in the MC1R of ruffed lemurs, which have the E94K mutation that
   leads to constitutive activation in other species. In 3 species (2
   lemurs and the howler monkey), we report the novel finding that binding
   and inhibition of MC1R by agouti signaling protein (ASIP) can occur when
   MSH binding has been lost, thus enabling continuing regulation of the
   melanin type via ASIP expression. Together, these findings can explain
   the previous paradox of a predominantly pheomelanic coat in the red
   ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra). The presence of a functional,
   MSH-responsive MC1R in orangutan demonstrates that the mechanism of red
   hair generation in this ape is different from the prevalent mechanism in
   European human populations. Overall, we have found unexpected diversity
   in MC1R function among primates and show that the evolution of the
   regulatory control of MC1R activity occurs by independent variation of 3
   distinct mechanisms: basal MC1R activity, MSH binding and activation,
   and ASIP binding and inhibition. This diversity of function is broadly
   associated with primate phylogeny and does not have a simple relation to
   coat color phenotype within primate clades.},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {Field observations suggest that the diet of the Malagasy gray mouse
   lemur consists not only of non-stationary animal prey (invertebrates or
   small vertebrates), but also of stationary food resources such as gum or
   homopteran larvae secretions (HLS). We studied the foraging behavior of
   five mouse lemurs radiotelemetrically, each during six consecutive
   nights in the dry season, to explore to which extent they use these food
   resources and whether there is evidence for their relocation. We found
   that animals used all three different food categories. Mouse lemurs fed
   on gums and spent 68.5\% (range 20.1-99.7\%) of their feeding time
   eating this item. They were observed eating HLS in 8.4\% (range
   0-71.5\%) of the feeding time and consuming small animals in 8.4\%
   (range 0.3-26\%) of their feeding time. The animals relocated stationary
   feeding sites significantly more frequently than non-stationary ones.
   They revisited the relocated stationary food sites about five times over
   the six nights. Furthermore, departure directions when leaving the
   sleeping site at dusk were not randomly distributed but showed a
   preferred orientation. Altogether, we provided first evidence for the
   relocation of stationary food resources in nature and thereby for the
   potential significance of spatial memory during foraging in a
   strepsirhine primate.},

Title = {Genetic and morphometric differentiation among island populations of two

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Aim Anole lizards (Reptilia: Sauria: Polychrotidae) display remarkable
   morphological and genetic differentiation between island populations.
   Morphological differences between islands are probably due to both
   adaptive (e.g. differential resource exploitation and intra- or
   interspecific competition) and non-adaptive differentiation in
   allopatry. Anoles are well known for their extreme diversity and rapid
   adaptive speciation on islands. The main aim of this study was to use
   tests of morphological and genetic differentiation to investigate the
   population structure and colonization history of islands of the Islas de
   Bahia, off the coast of Honduras.
   Location Five populations of Norops bicaorum and Norops lemurinus were
   sampled, four from islands of the Islas de Bahia and one from the
   mainland of Honduras.
   Methods Body size and weight differentiation were measured in order to
   test for significant differences between sexes and populations. In
   addition, individuals were genotyped using the amplified fragment length
   polymorphism technique. Bayesian model-based and assignment/exclusion
   methods were used to study genetic differentiation between island and
   mainland populations and to test colonization hypotheses.
   Results Assignment tests suggested migration from the mainland to the
   Cayos Cochinos, and from there independently to both Utila and Roatan,
   whereas migration between Utila and Roatan was lacking. Migration from
   the mainland to Utila was inferred, but was much less frequent.
   Morphologically, individuals from Utila appeared to be significantly
   different in comparison with all other localities. Significant
   differentiation between males of Roatan and the mainland was found in
   body size, whereas no significant difference was detected between the
   mainland and the Cayos Cochinos.
   Main conclusions Significant genetic and morphological differentiation
   was found among populations. A stepping-stone model for colonization, in
   combination with an independent migration to Utila and Roatan, was
   suggested by assignment tests and was compatible with the observed
   morphological differentiation.},

Abstract = {Mutations in PROP1 are a common genetic cause of multiple pituitary
   hormone deficiency (MPHD). We used a comparative genomics approach to
   predict the transcriptional regulatory domains of Prop1 and tested them
   in cell culture and mice. A BAC transgene containing Prop1 completely
   rescues the Prop1 mutant phenotype, demonstrating that the regulatory
   elements necessary for proper PROP1 transcription are contained within
   the BAC. We generated DNA sequences from the PROP1 genes in lemur, pig,
   and five different primate species. Comparison of these with available
   human and mouse Prop1 sequences identified three putative regulatory
   sequences that are highly conserved. These are located in the Prop1
   promoter proximal region, within the first intron of Prop1, and
   downstream of Prop1. Each of the conserved elements elicited
   orientation-specific enhancer activity in the context of the Drosophila
   alcohol dehydrogenase minimal promoter in both heterologous and
   pituitary-derived cells lines. The intronic element is sufficient to
   confer dorsal expansion of the pituitary expression domain of a
   transgene, suggesting that this element is important for the normal
   spatial expression of endogenous Prop1 during pituitary development.
   This study illustrates the usefulness of a comparative genomics approach
   in the identification of regulatory elements that may be the site of
   mutations responsible for some cases of MPHD.},

Abstract = {A new burnetiamorph therapsid, Lophorhinus willodenensis, gen. et sp.
   nov., is described on the basis of a partial skull from the Permian
   Teekloof Formation (Beaufort Group) of the Beaufort West District,
   Western Cape Province, South Africa. Although similar to the coeval
   burnetiamorph Lobalopex, Lophorhinus is autapomorphic in its possession
   of a semicircular median nasal crest formed by unfused nasals, doubled
   lacrimal foramina, an ossified sphenethmoid, and a mesiodistally
   compressed first premaxillary tooth. New morphological data provided by
   Lophorhinus permit the recognition of several character states that have
   been difficult to evaluate in other burnetiamorph taxa, including a (1)
   short dorsal process of the premaxilla, (2) contribution of the frontal
   to the upper orbital margin, and (3) lack of a significant contribution
   of the prefrontal to the supraorbital boss. An updated cladistic
   analysis of twelve biarmosuchians suggests that Lophorhinus is the
   sister taxon to Lobalopex + Burnetiidae. However, the precise
   relationships among Lemurosaurus, Lobalopex, and Lophorhinus are
   unresolved in the strict consensus of 25 primary trees. The discovery of
   Lophorhinus in the Tropidostoma Assemblage Zone (AZ) demonstrates that
   multiple burnetiamorph taxa co-existed in southern Gondwana during
   Middle and Late Permian times. Systematic collecting from the
   Tropidostoma AZ suggests that carnivorous burnetiamorphs, gorgonopsians,
   and therocephalians are exceedingly rare components of the tetrapod
   fauna, with herbivorous dicynodonts dominating the fossil record
   (121/126 specimens collected). Field collections of tetrapods from the
   Tropidostoma AZ are most similar in their composition to those described
   from the stratigraphically higher Dicynodon AZ, implying relatively
   stable tetrapod community structure in southern Pangea for the final 10
   million years of the Permian.},

Title = {Evolutionary dynamics of vertebrate body mass range},
Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Pages = {685-693},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Change in body mass with time has been considered for many clades, often
   with reference to Cope's rule, which predicts a tendency to increase in
   body size. A more general rule, namely increase in the range of body
   mass with time, is analyzed here for vertebrates. The log range of log
   vertebrate body mass is shown to increase linearly and highly
   significantly with the log of duration of clade existence. The resulting
   regression equations are used to predict the origin age, initial body
   mass, and subsequent dynamics of body mass range for primate clades such
   as the New World monkeys (Platyrrhini, 32 million years ago, initial
   mass of 1.7 kg) and the Anthropoidea (57 million years ago, initial mass
   of 0.12 kg), tested against the primate fossil record. Using these
   methods, other major primate clades such as Lemuriformes and Adapoidea
   are also estimated to have originated in the Tertiary (63 and 64 million
   years ago, respectively), with only the Plesiadapiformes originating in
   the Cretaceous (83 million years ago). Similarities of body mass range
   between primate and other vertebrate sister groups are discussed. Linear
   relationships of log range and log duration are considered with respect
   to Brownian processes, with the expected regression coefficients from
   the latter explored through simulations. The observed data produce
   regression coefficients that overlap with or are higher than those under
   Brownian processes. Overall, the analyses suggest the dynamics of
   vertebrate body mass range in morphologically disparate clades are
   highly predictable over many tens of million years and that the dynamics
   of phenotypic characteristics can assist molecular clock and fossil
   models in dating evolutionary events.},

Abstract = {Coat color offers some prospects for evolutionary studies due to its
   large amount of presumably adaptive coat color variation and conserved
   genetic mechanisms of generating different coat colors in different
   species. Melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor (MSHR) gene is
   responsible for intraspecific and interspecific color variation in
   mammals and birds. A total number of 206 MSHR gene sequences belonging
   to 84 species, 58 genera, and 20 families were analyzed to investigate
   its evolution and differentiation in different species. Most of the
   species have 954 bp and stop codon TGA. Species in Callithrix and
   Callimico have a stop codon mutation from TGA to TGG and elongate 81 bp
   with TAG as stop codon. Species in Phasianidae, Fringillidae, and
   Lemuridae also use TAG as stop codon. The Sus scrofa had an insertion of
   AACCAGACC encoding Asn-Gln-Thr from 85 to 93 bp. In Bovidae, a brown
   strain of cow with 966 bp due to the 12-bp duplication of GGCATTGCCCGG
   from 670 to 681 bp encoding for Gly-Ile-Ala-Arg was found. Teiidae has
   the smallest number of total mutations (6), silent mutations (3),
   nonsynonymous mutations (3), average number of nucleotide differences
   (1.519), synonymous nucleotide diversity (pi(s) = 0.0030), and
   nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity (pi(a) = 0.0029), and Hominidae,
   Lemuridae, Canidae, and Teiidae have higher ratio of pi(a)/pi(s)
   (0.537-0.973). The reconstructed phylogenetic tree of MSHR gene of
   families is basically consistent with the taxonomy of National Center
   for Biotechnology Information.},

Abstract = {Turbinals (scroll bones, turbinates) are projections from the lateral
   wall of the nasal fossa. These bones vary from simple folds to branching
   scrolls. Conventionally, maxilloturbinals comprise the respiratory
   turbinals, whereas nasoturbinals and ethmoturbinals comprise olfactory
   turbinals, denoting the primary type of mucosa that lines these conchae.
   However, the first ethmoturbinal (ETI) appears exceptional in the
   variability of it mucosal covering. Recently, it was suggested that the
   distribution of respiratory versus olfactory mucosae varies based on
   body size or age in strepsirrhine primates (lemurs and lorises). The
   present study was undertaken to determine how the rostrocaudal
   distribution of olfactory epithelium (OE) versus non-OE scales relative
   to palatal length in strepsirrhines. Serially sectioned heads of 20
   strepsirrhines (10 neonates, 10 adults) were examined for presence of OE
   on ETI, rostral to its attachment to the nasal fossa wall (lateral
   root). Based on known distances between sections of ETI, the
   rostrocaudal length of OE was measured and compared to the length lined
   solely by non-OE (primarily respiratory epithelium). In 13 specimens,
   the total surface area of OE versus non-OE was calculated. Results show
   that the length of non-OE scales nearly isometrically with cranial
   length, while OE is more negatively allometric. In surface area, a
   lesser percentage of non-OE exists in smaller species than larger
   species and between neonates and adults. Such results are consistent
   with recent suggestions that the olfactory structures do not scale
   closely with body size, whereas respiratory structures (e.g.,
   maxilloturbinals) may scale close to isometry. In primates and perhaps
   other mammals, variation in ETI morphology may reflect dual adaptations
   for olfaction and endothermy.},

Title = {Sequence evolution of the sperm ligand zonadhesin correlates negatively

Abstract = {Sexual selection has repeatedly been shown to be the probable driving
   force behind the positive Darwinian evolution of genes affecting male
   reproductive success. Here we compare the sequence evolution of the
   sperm ligand zonadhesin with body mass dimorphism in primates. In
   contrast to previous related studies, the present approach takes into
   account not only catarrhine primates, but also platyrrhines and lemurs.
   In detail, we analyze the sequence evolution of concatenated zonadhesin
   fragments (555 bp) of four Lemuroidea, five Platyrrhini, and seven
   Catarrhini, using the rate ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous
   substitutions (d(n)/d(s) = omega). Unexpectedly, subsequent regression
   analyzes between w estimates for the terminal branches of a primate
   phylogeny and residual male body mass reveal that sequence evolution of
   zonadhesin decreases with increasing sexual dimorphism in body weight.
   Mapping published mating system classifications onto these results
   illustrates that unimale breeding species show a tendency for rather
   slow sequence evolution of zonadhesin and comparably pronounced sexual
   dimorphism in body weight. Female choice and sperm competition can be
   assumed to drive the evolution of zonadhesin. We speculate that the
   level of sperm competition is lower in more sexually dimorphic primates
   because males of these species monopolize access to fertile females more
   successfully. Thus, variation in sperm competition may be driving the
   observed negative correlation of sequence evolution and sexual
   dimorphism in body weight.},

Abstract = {Human microsporidiosis, a serious disease of immunocompetent and

   microsporidian spores. A survey utilizing chromotrope 2R stain and
   fluorescent in situ hybridization techniques for testing feces from 193
   captive mammals demonstrated that 3 animals (1.6\%) shed Encephalitozoon
   bieneusi spores. These include two critically endangered species (i.e.,
   black lemurs, Eulemur macaco flavifrons; and Visayan warty pig, Sus
   cebifrons negrinus) and a threatened species (mongoose lemur, Eulemur
   mongoz). The concentration of spores varied from 2.7x10(5) to
   5.7x10(5)/g of feces, and all infections were asymptomatic. The study
   demonstrates that E. bieneusi spores can originate from captive animals,
   which is of particular epidemiologic importance because the close
   containment of zoological gardens can facilitate pathogen spread to
   other animals and also to people such as zoo personnel and visitors.},

Abstract = {Plesiadapiforms are central to studies of the origin and evolution of
   primates and other euarchontan mammals (tree shrews and flying lemurs).
   We report results from a comprehensive cladistic analysis using cranial,
   postcranial, and dental evidence including data from recently discovered
   Paleocene plesiadapiform skeletons (Ignacius clarkforkensis sp. nov.;
   Dryomomys szalayi, gen. et sp. nov.), and the most plesiomorphic extant
   tree shrew, Ptilocercus lowii. Our results, based on the fossil record,
   unambiguously place plesiadapiforms with Euprimates and indicate that
   the divergence of Primates (sensu lato) from other euarchontans likely
   occurred before or just after the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary (65 Mya),
   notably later than logistical model and molecular estimates. Anatomical
   features associated with specialized pedal grasping (including a nail on
   the hallux) and a petrosal bulla likely evolved in the common ancestor
   of Plesiadapoidea and Euprimates (Euprimateformes) by 62 Mya in either
   Asia or North America. Our results are consistent with those from recent
   molecular analyses that group Dermoptera with Scandentia. We find no
   evidence to support the hypothesis that any plesiadapiforms were
   mitten-gliders or closely related to Dermoptera.},

Abstract = {In predicate logic, the proof that a theorem P holds in a theory Th is
   typically conducted in natural deduction or in the sequent calculus
   using all the information contained in the theory in a uniform way.
   Introduced ten years ago, Deduction modulo allows us to make use of the
   computational part of the theory Th for true computations modulo which
   deductions are performed.
   Focusing on the sequent calculus, this paper presents and studies the
   dual concept where the theory is used to enrich the deduction system
   with new deduction rules in a systematic, correct and complete way. We
   call such a new deduction system ``superdeduction ``.
   We introduce a proof-term language and a cutelimination procedure both
   based on Christian Urban's work on classical sequent calculus. Strong
   normalisation is proven under appropriate and natural hypothesis,
   therefore ensuring the consistency of the embedded theory and of the
   deduction system.
   The proofs obtained in such a new system are much closer to the human
   intuition and practice. We consequently sketch how superdeduction along
   with deduction modulo can be used to ground the formal foundations of
   new extendible proof assistants like lemurid ae, our prototypal
   implementation of superdeduction modulo.},

   sequent calculus by new deduction rules computed from the user theory.
   We show how this could be done in a systematic, correct and complete
   way. We prove in detail the strong normalisation of a proof term
   language that models appropriately superdeduction. We finaly examplify
   on several examples, including equality and noetherian induction, the
   usefulness of this approach which is implemented in the lemurid ae

   decided to concentrate only on the monolingual searching in the Czech
   test collection and investigate the effect; of proper language
   processing on the retrieval performance. We have employed the Czech
   morphological analyser and tagger for that purposes. For the actual
   search system, we have used the classical tf. idf approach with blind
   relevance feedback as implemented in the Lemur toolkit. The results
   indicate that a suitable linguistic preprocessing is indeed crucial for
   the Czech IR performance.},

   Language Processing, because Arabic is a highly inflected language. We
   have found, however, that a full solution to this problem is not

   remarkably good information retrieval without providing correct
   morphological analyses. We developed several light stemmers for Arabic,
   and assessed their effectiveness for information retrieval using
   standard TREC data. We have also compared light stemming with several
   stemmers based on morphological analysis. The light stemmer, light10,
   outperformed the other approaches. It has been included in the Lemur
   toolkit, and is becoming widely used Arabic information retrieval},

Title = {Biotransformation of Hg(II) by cyanobacteria},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {73},
Number = {1},
Pages = {243-249},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The biotransformation of Hg(II) by cyanobacteria was investigated under
   aerobic and pH-controlled culture conditions. Mercury was supplied as
   HgCl2 in amounts emulating those found under heavily impacted
   environmental conditions where bioremediation would be appropriate. The
   analytical procedures used to measure mercury within the culture
   solution, including that in the cyanobacterial cells, used reduction
   under both acid and alkaline conditions in the presence of SnCl2. Acid
   reduction detected free Hg(II) ions and its complexes, whereas alkaline
   reduction revealed that meta-cinnabar (beta-HgS) constituted the major
   biotransformed and cellularly associated mercury pool. This was true for
   all investigated species of cyanobacteria: Limnothrix planctonica
   (Lemur.), Synechococcus leopoldiensis (Racib.) Komarek, and Phormidium
   limnetica (Lemur.). From the outset of mercury exposure, there was rapid
   synthesis of beta-HgS and Hg(0); however, the production rate for the
   latter decreased quickly. Inhibitory studies using dimethylfumarate and
   iodoacetamide to modify intra- and extracellular thiols, respectively,
   revealed that the former thiol pool was required for the conversion of
   Hg(II) into beta-HgS. In addition, increasing the temperature enhanced
   the amount of beta-HgS produced, with a concomitant decrease in Hg(0)
   volatilization. These findings suggest that in the environment,
   cyanobacteria at the air-water interface could act to convert
   substantial amounts of Hg(II) into beta-HgS. Furthermore, the efficiency
   of conversion into beta-HgS by cyanobacteria may lead to the development
   of applications in the bioremediation of mercury.},

Abstract = {I present data on variations in Eulemur fulvus rufus and Lepilemur
   mustelinus densities as well as tree characteristics (height, diameter
   and stem frequency) between edge and interiorforest habitats in
   southeastern Madagascar. Line transect surveys were conducted from June
   2003 to November 2005 in edge and interior forest habitats in the
   Vohibola III Classified Forest. Although E. f. rufus densities were
   significantly lower in edge habitats than in interior habitats, density
   estimates for L. mustelinus did not differ significantly between
   habitats. Trees in edge habitats were significantly shorter, had smaller
   diameters and had lower stem frequencies (for those > 25 cm in diameter)
   than trees in interior habitats. Spatial characteristics of food
   abundance and quality may explain lemur density patterns in Vohibola
   III. Low E f. rufus densities may reduce seed dispersal in edge
   habitats, which has important consequences for the long-term viability
   of forest ecosystems in Madagascar. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG,

Title = {The biogeography of large islands, or how does the size of the
   ecological theater affect the evolutionary play?},
Journal = {REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {62},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {105-168},
Abstract = {We compare selected aspects of the biotas of long-isolated islands
   ranging in size from Reunion to early Pliocene South America, focusing
   on Madagascar, New Zealand, New Caledonia and the Hawaiian Islands.
   Although Madagascar and New Zealand were joined to larger land masses
   less than 90 million years ago, their biotas arc overwhelmingly
   dominated by descendants of colonists from overseas. The size of a
   long-isolated land mass decisively influences major features of its
   ecosystem. On smaller islands, extinction is more likely, colonization
   is rarer, and there are fewer opportunities for diversification. The
   largest herbivores and the largest carnivores are smaller on smaller
   islands. Reduced diversity, lower predation pressure and diminished
   evolutionary innovation reduce the severity of competition on smaller
   islands: their plants are less well defended against vertebrate
   herbivores, and their primary productivity is lower, while their annuals
   are longer-lived, less fecund, and have lower basal metabolism than
   mainland ecological counterparts. Herbivores arc most likely to evolve
   convergently with counterparts on other land masses with predators of
   similar size and/or efficiency. Thus sloth lemurs converged on tree
   sloths, Megaladapis on koalas, and moa-nalos on moas and elephant birds.
   The degree of an island's isolation also affects its ecosystem's
   characteristics. More isolated islands receive fewer immigrants, so
   diversity is lower on more isolated islands, especially small islands
   with high risks of extinction. Fewer mainland immigrants, whose
   efficiency was tested against a variety of competitors and well-defended
   prey, reach more isolated islands, so competition is less intense on
   these islands, and these islands' predators are less efficient. Smaller
   size and greater isolation therefore make a land mass more invasible.
   Islands with the fewest predators and the slowest pace of life are most
   likely to be catastrophically disrupted by mainland invaders. All these
   phenomena have analogues in human economies. As a rule, economies with
   higher total production support more intense competition, more
   innovation, a greater diversity of occupations, a faster pace of life,
   and greater productivity per capita.},

Title = {Applying behavioral ecology and Behavioral economics to conservation and

Journal = {HUMAN NATURE-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY BIOSOCIAL PERSPECTIVE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {190-208},
Abstract = {Governments and non-govermental organizations ( NGOs) that plan projects
   to conserve the environment and alleviate poverty often attempt to
   modify rural livelihoods by halting activities they judge to be
   destructive or inefficient and encouraging alternatives. Project
   planners typically do so without understanding how rural people
   themselves judge the value of their activities. When the alternatives
   planners recommend do not replace the value of banned activities,
   alternatives are unlikely to be adopted, and local people will refuse to
   participate. Human behavioral ecology and behavioral economics may
   provide useful tools for generating and evaluating hypotheses for how
   people value economic activities in their portfolios and potential
   alternatives. This is demonstrated with a case example from southwestern
   Madagascar, where plans to create a Mikea Forest National Park began
   with the elimination of slash-and-burn maize agriculture and the
   encouragement to plant labor-intensive manioc instead. Future park plans
   could restrict access to wild tuber patches, hunting small game, and
   fishing. The value of these activities is considered using observational
   data informed by optimal foraging theory, and experimental data
   describing people's time preference and covariation perception. Analyses
   suggest that manioc is not a suitable replacement for maize for many
   Mikea because the two crops differ in terms of labor requirements,
   delay-to-reward, and covariation with rainfall. Park planners should
   promote wild tuber foraging and stewardship of tuber patches and the
   anthropogenic landscapes in which they are found. To conserve small
   game, planners must provide alternative sources of protein and cash.
   Little effort should be spent protecting lemurs, as they are rarely
   eaten and never sold.},

Abstract = {The study of self-medication among animals-zoopharmacognosy-is founded
   on observations that suggest that wild animals use plants with specific
   biological properties that may be beneficial to them. To verify whether
   self-vermifugation occurs among Eulemur fulvus in the wild, we studied
   their feeding behavior in both the dry and humid forests of Mayotte
   (Comoros Islands). We used the focal individual sampling method over an
   annual cycle. We conducted a complementary study during the 2-mo mating
   season, via the scan sampling method (at 10-min intervals). Among the 29
   plant species brown lemurs consumed, we tested 16 in vitro as
   antiparasitic agents on 3 experimental parasite models (Rhabditis
   pseudoelongata, Trichomonas vaginalis, Entamoeba invadens). We obtained
   crude extracts to be tested after 2 successive chemical extractions
   (ethyl acetate and methanol), and 7 of them, belonging to 4 different
   plant species, showed an antiparasitic property: lemurs consumed Annona
   squamosa and Mimusops comorensis in large amounts, but ingested Ixora
   cremixora and Syzygium jambos sporadically. The 4 plants were active on
   the flagellate but only one of them Ixora cremixora) also demonstrated
   antinematode properties. Humans use 2 of the plants as intestinal
   antiparasitic agents in traditional medicine and include numerous other
   plants in the diet. The relative lake of amoebas and flagellates in
   stools of Eulemur fulvus may be related to the consumption of plants
   with antiprotozoal properties. Nevertheless, in the absence of specific
   behavior that could be linked to a voluntary therapeutic action during
   our study, self-vermifugation in Eulemur fulvus remains elusive.},

Abstract = {Members of the Family Triophinae (Rudman, 1998), Gastropoda;
   Opisthobranchia, are characterized by having a reduced mantle, a narrow
   ridge along the sides of the body and a veil surrounding the head. This
   family is composed by seven genera of which only two have been observed
   to have bioluminescent species; Kaloplocamus Bergh, 1892 and
   Plocamopherus Ruppell \& Leuckart, 1831. In order to better understand
   the evolution of bioluminescence within these dorids a phylogenetic
   analysis based on morphological and molecular data comprising all genera
   pertaining to the subfamily Triophinae was under-taken. Because there is
   great taxonomic confusion regarding Kaloplocamus and Plocamopherus
   species, this study is an attempt to do a taxonomic and morphological
   revision of both genera. Furthermore the description of new species for
   both Kaloplocamus and Plocamopherus are included. Five species of
   Kaloplocamus were examined in this study, including three taxa described

Abstract = {``Undoubtedly the most distinctive trait of the Primates, wherein this
   order contrasts with all other mammalian orders in its evolutionary
   history, is the tendency towards the development of a brain which is
   large in proportion to the total body weight, and which is particularly
   characterized by a relatively extensive and often richly convoluted
   cerebral cortex (p. 228).{''}(1) While this statement is generally true,
   primate brains vary in size nearly one thousand-fold, from a mass of 1.8
   g in the tiny mouse lemur to 1,300 g in modern humans. Many attempts
   have been made to understand both the distinctiveness of primate brains
   and the variation observed within the order: How did such variation
   evolve and why, and what are its cognitive implications? Following
   Jerison's(2) masterly review thirty years ago, comparative studies have
   highlighted suggestive correlations of brain size. However, the meaning
   and validity of these correlations have been vigorously debated. It has
   become clear that progress depends on taking great care in the use of
   comparative methods and in finding multiple converging strands of
   comparative evidence as opposed to making speculative interpretations of
   single correlations. In particular, recent work demonstrates the value
   of examining how evolutionary changes at different anatomical levels
   interrelate.},

Title = {Masking: a type of entrainment. Part one},
Journal = {SALUD MENTAL},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {29},
Number = {6},
Pages = {39-47},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Organisms adapt their temporary niche with two complementary mechanisms.
   The first mechanism is referred to as entrainment Of the endogenous
   biological clock, which circumscribes temporarily the activity of the
   subject into day or night. The second mechanism is defined as masking,
   and this refers to an alternative route which does not involve the
   activity of the pacemaker. It involves, instead, a sharp response of the
   animal during light-time, inhibiting or enhancing the expression of
   locomotor activities in nocturnal or diurnal species, respectively.
   Masking describes the direct and immediate effects on the expression of
   any biological rhythm induced by the season-dependent signals present in
   the environment. Moreover, this masking mechanism appears to complement
   the biological clock entrainment, which is used by organisms to adapt to
   their specific nocturnal or diurnal niche.
   Several constraints arise when trying to study the biological clock
   entrainment or the light-associated oscillators system. These are due to
   the fact that the zeitgeber influences the biological clock and affects
   the output response of the circadian clock. According to the
   aforementioned description, it appears the masking effects occur as a
   natural event and result from an inevitable consequence to the
   season-dependent life of living organisms. Circadian rhythms do not only
   reflect the physiological output responses of the biological clocks as
   their activities also result from a mixture of responses arising either
   from the masking effects and/or from the entrainment mechanisms driving
   the timing of the biological clock within the animal.
   Although conspicuous differences do exist between masking- and
   entrained- rhythms, both rhythms follow a similar time-course.
   Nevertheless, the transition between light and darkness (environmental
   change) under the masking rhythm results in abrupt changes in the animal
   behavior activity (i.e, from a resting to an ambulatory activity or
   viceversa). In contrast, when the environment acts as a zeitgeber under
   the biological clock entrainment, the behavioural transition of the
   animal appears to be less abrupt and, therefore, the environment factors
   affecting the biological rhythms never match.
   Based on different chronobiological studies in animals, several authors
   have described different forms of masking mechanisms used by the brain,
   and classified according to the light-induced decrease or increase
   locomotor activity responses: a) Positive Masking refers to the increase
   or decrease of locomotor activity response in a diurnal or nocturnal
   animal, respectively, as a result of the increase in lighting; b)
   Negative Masking refers to the decrease of locomotor activity responses
   as a result of decrease in lighting in a diurnal animal, or an increase
   in lighting in a nocturnal animal; c) Paradoxical Positive Masking
   refers either to the increase locomotor activity responses of a
   nocturnal animal exposed to increase lighting or an increase in
   locomotor activity responses in a diurnal animal after lighting
   decreases; d) Paradoxical Negative Masking refers to the decrease of
   locomotor activity responses in a nocturnal animal when lighting is
   decreased, or to the decrease of locomotor activity responses in a
   diurnal animal when lighting is increased.
   In addition to the aforementioned classification of different masking
   mechanisms on the behavioral locomotor activity responses in both
   diurnal and nocturnal animals, other authors classify different forms of
   masking, based on the neural mechanisms that generate the masking
   effects. Authors defined the occurence of different forms of masking
   effects when enviromental factors (i.e, fight, darkness) produce direct
   or indirect effects on the cyrcadian rhythm in an animal. Thus, a) Type
   I masking occurs when the environment produces a direct effect on the
   circadian rhythm output; b) Type II masking occurs when behavioral
   changes in the animal affect other physiological brain-rhythms, for
   instance, an increase or decrease of behavioral locomotor activity may
   affect the temperature rhythm of an organism, enhancing the expression
   of an altered activity on the biological clock; c) Type III masking
   occurs when physiological or biochemical changes alter the neural output
   of the biological clock that conveys the time-related information of the
   biological rhythm; for instance, physiological or pathological
   conditions have been shown to affect the functional activity of specific
   neural pathways and their membrane receptors involved in the regulation
   of the body temperature. Such situations appear to modify the phase of
   the body temperature rhythm with the phase of the biological clock,
   which both rhythms appear to match under basal conditions.
   The sensibility limits necessary to generate the inhibition of the
   synthesis and release of melatonine, in rats and hamster, suggest the
   involvement of the rods, the predominant photoreceptor in the rodent
   retina. Nevertheless, studies the mutant mice rd/rd (the mutation rd
   generates the total loss of photoreceptors type rods and a considerable
   loss of photoreceptors type cones) presented an inhibition in the
   synthesis and release of the melatonine and locomotor activity induced
   by the light. This suggests that the photoreceptors type cones and rods
   are not necessary to mediate the effects of the light on the locomotor
   activity and that the light masking depends on another type of contained
   photoreceptor in the retina.
   Some studies report the loss of the rhythmycity in drinking, locomotion
   or sleep-wakefulness, not only when the animals are kept in light
   constant, also when the animals are kept under light-darkness cycles
   (L:D).
   Other studies that involve to mutant mice of the two genes cryptocromos,
   which they, are arrhythmic in constant conditions; they show a SCN
   functional diminished, light pulses applied in the subjective night do
   not generate alterations in the inhibition of the locomotor activity
   induced by the light. This suggests the loss of the masking responses
   induced by light. Certainly, these results point to a loss or
   attenuation of the masking by the SCN lesion. On the other hand, other
   works showing a persistence of the masking pd drinking and locomotor
   activity in L:D conditions after the SCN lesions.
   The lesions of other structures of the rodent visual system alter the
   light masking. It is more a significant increase of the masking in
   subjects with IGL lesion is observed. Subsequently, it was reported that
   the masking induced by the light,vas more significant in mice that were
   submitted to an NGLd lesions, which suggests that the increase in the
   masking to the light observed after the IGL lesions are probably due to
   an incidental damage of the NGLd. It also has been reported that the
   light masking increase after the visual cortex lesions in hamster and
   mice.
   The mutant mice clock shows brilliant light pulses: between 100 to 1600
   lux they induce a complete suppression of the locomotor activity
   (negative masking). On the other hand, dim light pulses induce an
   increment of the basal levels of the locomotor activity (positive
   masking) in a similar way to that of the normal subjects. The
   participation of other genes clock in the regulation of the
   light-masking has not been specific.
   The masking is not a limited phenomenon to conditions of laboratory.
   There are few examples of the direct effects of light on the temporary
   organization of the behavior in wildlife. An impressive case is the owl
   primate (Aotus lemurinus griseimembra), which shows a pattern of
   locomotor activity that depends on the lunar cycle. This primate is
   nocturnal, but its activity increases (positive masking) when the
   luminescence is found between 0.1 and 0.5 lux, the luminescence
   generated precisely by the brightness of the moon. Intensities of light
   lower to this diminish the locomotor activity (negative masking) of the
   subject.
   The masking mechanism is an important process in the adaptation of an
   organism to its environment as it confers this the capacity to respond
   quickly to a sudden change in environmental conditions.
   Since the functional point of view the masking contributes to an
   increment in the amplitude of a entrainment rhythm, promotes direct
   responses to geophysical variables that the organism selects that they
   optimize its evolution and its adaptation to its temporary niche, all
   this contributes to an increase in the probability of survival of the
   subject to its environment.},

Abstract = {Human lemur (Lmr) kinases are predicted to be Tyr kinases based on
   sequences and are related to neurotrophin receptor Trk kinases. This
   study used homogeneous recombinant KPI-2 (Lmr2, LMTK2, Cprk,
   brain-enriched protein kinase) kinase domain and a library of 1,154
   peptides on a microarray to analyze substrate specificity. We found that
   KPI-2 is strictly a Ser/Thr kinase that reacts with Ser either preceded
   by or followed by Pro residues but unlike other Pro-directed kinases
   does not strictly require an adjacent Pro residue. The most reactive
   peptide in the library corresponds to Ser-737 of cystic fibrosis
   transmembrane conductance regulator, and the recombinant R domain of
   cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator was a preferred
   substrate. Furthermore the KPI-2 kinase phosphorylated peptides
   corresponding to the single site in phosphorylase and purified
   phosphorylase b, making this only the second known phosphorylase b
   kinase. Phosphorylase was used as a specific substrate to show that
   KPI-2 is inhibited in living cells by addition of nerve growth factor or
   serum. The results demonstrate the utility of the peptide library to
   probe specificity and discover kinase substrates and offer a specific
   assay that reveals hormonal regulation of the activity of this unusual
   transmembrane kinase.},

   blood inoculation. The Sri Lanka strain of P. fragile was transmitted to
   Macaca mulatta, Macaca fascicularis, Aotus lemurinus griseimembra, Aotus

   sporozoites that developed to maturity only in Anopheles dirus

   of sporozoites. Eight rhesus monkeys were infected with the Nilgiri
   strain and followed for 482 days. Parasitemia in 6 animals persisted at
   relatively high density through the period of observation. Erythrocyte,
   hematocrit, and hemoglobin values reached their lowest levels 3 wk after
   infection and slowly recovered; however, the values did not approach
   preinfection levels as long as parasiternia persisted in the monkeys.
   The mean corpuscular volume and corpuscular hemoglobin concentration

   the study was to examine the morphology of the brain vessels of seven
   elderly animals from 7-21 years of age (three monkeys, a likaon, wolf
   and two pigs). The brain vessels of the investigated animals
   demonstrated atherosclerotic changes such as: fibroid changes and
   amyloidal angiopathy (CAA) in the cortical and leptomeningeal vessels of
   the three monkeys, likaon and wolf brain. Fibroid arteritis was present
   in the meningeal arteries of the two sows. These atherosclerotic and
   inflammatory processes in the CNS vessels led to strokes and
   hemorrhages. Subarachnoid (Cebus apella) and intraventricular (Lemur
   mongoz) hemorrhages were noted in two of the monkey's brains and
   fibrinotic arteritis produced massive mesencephalon hemorrhaging in the
   two 7-year old sows. The advanced stages of infarct necrosis were
   characterized by a predominance of vacuolated macrophages with
   proliferating mesodermal and glial components. Small post infarct and
   post hemorrhages lesions in nervous tissue produced scarring, with
   astrocytes, whereas large foci liquefied and formed cysts, marked by the
   presence of macrophages with hemosyderin in their margins. No
   atheromatosis changes were observed in the brain vessels.},

   encompassing the regulatory GT repeat region are similar across species
   and are completely conserved in great apes. However, Old World monkeys
   lack GT repeats altogether, while New World monkeys and ring-tailed
   lemurs have much more complex structures around the position of the
   repeats. In conclusion, the genetic structures encompassing the
   regulatory GT repeats in intron 2 of human TLR2 are similar among
   nonhuman primates. The sequence is most conserved in New World monkeys
   and less in Old World monkeys.},

Abstract = {Cynocephalid dermopterans (flying lemurs) are represented by only two
   living genera (Cynocephalus and Galeopterus), which inhabit tropical
   rainforests of South-East Asia. Despite their very poor diversity and
   their limited distribution, dermopterans play a critical role in
   higher-level eutherian phylogeny inasmuch as they represent together
   with Scandentia (tree-shrew) the sister group of the Primates clade
   (Plesiadapiformes + Euprimates). However, unlike primates, for which the
   fossil record extends back to the early Palaeogene on all Holarctic
   continents and in Africa, the evolutionary history of the order
   Dermoptera sensu stricto (Cynocephalidae) has so far remained
   undocumented, with the exception of a badly preserved fragment of
   mandible from the late Eocene of Thailand (Dermotherium major). In this
   paper, we described newly discovered fossil dermopterans (essentially
   dental remains) from different regions of South Asia (Thailand, Myanmar,
   and Pakistan) ranging from the late middle Eocene to the late Oligocene.
   We performed microtomographic examinations at the European Synchrotron
   Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) to analyse different
   morphological aspects of the fossilized jaws. The abundant material from
   the late Oligocene of Thailand (Nong Ya Plong coal mine) allows us to
   emend the diagnosis of the genus Dermotherium and to describe a new
   species: Dermotherium chimaera sp. n. This species exhibits an
   interesting mosaic of plesiomorphic cynocephalid characters shared with
   Cynocephalus and Galeopterus, and as such, it probably documents a form
   close to the ancestral morphotype from which the two extant forms are
   derived (supported by cladistic assessment of the dental evidence). The
   discovery of Palaeogene cynocephalids is particularly significant since
   it attests to the great antiquity of the order Dermoptera in Asia, and
   besides, it provides the first spatio-temporal glimpse into the
   evolutionary history of that enigmatic mammal group. In that respect,
   these fossils testify to a long history of endemism in South Asia for
   dermopterans, and demonstrate that their modern geographic restriction
   in south-eastern Asia is clearly a relictual distribution. Cynocephalids
   had a more widespread distribution during the Palaeogene, which extended
   from the Indian subcontinent (the rafting Greater India) to South-East
   Asia. Their subsequent extinction on the Indian subcontinent was
   probably mediated by the major palaeogeographic and geomorphologic
   events related to the India-Eurasia collision (retreat of the Paratethys
   Sea, formation of orogenic highlands) that have strongly affected the
   climate of South Asia at the end of the Oligocene.},

Title = {The primate Harderian gland: Does it really exist?},

Volume = {188},

Abstract = {The Harderian gland, an anterior orbital structure, is either absent or
   vestigial in primates. This is based upon gross anatomical observations
   of scattered adult specimens. Though largely absent in the adult human,
   it is present in the fetal and neonatal stages. Thus, histological
   examination of the orbital region of neonatal material was undertaken in
   other primates. The orbital region of neonatal specimens of 12 species
   of strepsirrhines (Lemuriformes and Lorisiformes), and haplorhine
   (tarsiers and callitrichids) was examined. The Harderian gland is
   ensconced in either periorbital fat or connective tissue and thus was
   not readily identifiable gross anatomically. Thus, it may have been
   missed in the anatomical studies. Tarsal glands are present in all
   neonatal primate eyelids. The relative size of the neonatal primate
   Harderian gland can be subdivided into five separate categories, ranging
   from large to absent (tarsiers), with no apparent phylogenetic trends.
   Thus, the Harderian gland is present in numerous primates at birth,
   quite possibly all strepsirrhines. The positive findings on
   callitrichids question whether any anthropoids lack the Harderian gland
   postnatally. The enigmatic tarsier appears to possess another apomorphic
   trait in tacking a Harderian gland. Further study is required to
   determine the role of this gland and its relationship with the tarsal
   glands. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2006},
Volume = {26},

Pages = {331-343},
Month = {JUN 12},
Abstract = {The basal therapsid clade Burnetiamorpha is currently known from six
   genera of Middle-to-Late Permian age. Bullacephalus, Burnetia,
   Lemurosaurus, and Lobalopex are from the Beaufort Group of South Africa,
   whereas Niuksenitia and Proburnetia are from Russian deposits. Here we
   describe a new taxon from the Upper Permian Teekloof Formation of South
   Africa that is remarkably similar to Proburnetia. Paraburnetia
   sneeubergensis, gen. and sp. nov., is diagnosed by the following
   autapomorphies: supratemporal `horn' oriented vertically with bulbous
   terminal end, supraorbital boss with well-defined apical crest, and
   palatine-pterygoid boss elongate. Paraburnetia and Proburnetia share
   features indicating a sister-taxon relationship, including the presence
   of a well-developed median nasal crest and tall supraorbital bosses.
   Along with the close morphological similarity and phylogenetic
   relationships of several dicynodont taxa from Russia and South Africa,
   the discovery of Paraburnetia indicates that long-distance, north-south
   interchange was commonplace during the Late Permian and that
   burnetiamorphs likely had a Pangean distribution.},

Title = {Ancient positive selection on CD155 as a possible cause for
   susceptibility to poliovirus infection in simians},
Journal = {GENE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {373},
Pages = {16-22},
Month = {MAY 24},
Abstract = {Poliovirus is the etiological agent of poliomyelitis. From the
   observations that only simians are susceptible to poliovirus infection
   and that 37 amino acid sites (the poliovirus-binding associated {[}PBA]
   sites) in the domain D I of CD 155 are involved in the binding to
   poliovirus, it is considered that the susceptibility to poliovirus
   infection evolved through amino acid substitutions that occurred at the
   PBA sites on the ancestral branch of simians. Here it is shown that
   positive selection has operated on these substitutions by analyzing the
   nucleotide sequences encoding almost the entire region of D I in humans,
   non-human hominoids (chimpanzees and gorillas), Old World monkeys
   (African green monkeys), New World monkeys (brown capuchins, squirrel
   monkeys, and marmosets), prosimians (ring-tailed lemurs), and
   non-primate mammals (rabbits). Positive selection is unlikely to have
   operated on the susceptibility to poliovirus infection, but possibly on
   the binding to another molecule. Elimination of susceptibility to
   poliovirus infection in simians may be difficult, because it also
   requires elimination of advantageous effects that have been exerted by
   CD155. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of planning the motion of a
   multi-limbed robot in order to ``free-climb{''} vertical rock surfaces.
   Free-climbing only relies on frictional contact with the surfaces rather
   than on special fixtures or tools like pitons. It requires strength, but
   more importantly it requires deliberate reasoning: not only must the
   robot decide how to adjust its posture to reach the next feature without
   falling, it must plan an entire sequence of steps, where each one might
   have future consequences. In this paper this process of reasoning is
   broken into manageable pieces by decomposing a free-climbing robot's
   configuration space into manifolds associated with each state of contact
   between the robot and its environment. A multistep planning framework is
   presented that decides which manifolds to explore by generating a
   candidate sequence of hand and foot placements first. A one-step
   planning algorithm is then described that explores individual manifolds
   quickly. This algorithm extends the probabilistic roadmap approach to
   better handle the interaction between static equilibrium and the
   topology of closed kinematic chains. It is assumed throughout this paper
   that a set of potential contact points has been presurveyed. Validation
   with real hardware was done with a four-limbed robot called LEMUR
   (developed by the Mechanical and Robotic Technologies Group at
   NASA-JPL). Using the planner presented in this paper; LEMUR free-climbed
   all indoor near-vertical surface covered with artificial rock features.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {207-218},

Abstract = {Chytridiomycosis is an emerging infectious disease of amphibians caused
   by a chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This panzootic does
   not equally affect all amphibian species within an assemblage; some
   populations decline, others persist. Little is known about the factors
   that affect disease resistance. Differences in behavior, life history,
   biogeography, or immune function may impact survival. We found that an
   innate immune defense, antimicrobial skin peptides, varied significantly
   among species within a rainforest stream amphibian assemblage that has
   not been exposed to B. dendrobatidis. If exposed, all amphibian species
   at this central Panamanian site are at risk of population declines. In
   vitro pathogen growth inhibition by peptides from Panamanian species
   compared with species with known resistance (Rana pipiens and Xenopus
   laevis) or susceptibility (Bufo boreas) suggests that of the nine
   species examined, two species (Centrolene prosoblepon and Phyllomedusa
   lemur) may demonstrate strong resistance, and the other species will
   have a higher risk of disease-associated population declines. We found
   little variation among geographically distinct B. dendrobatidis isolates
   in sensitivity to an amphibian skin peptide mixture. This supports the
   hypothesis that B. dendrobatidis is a generalist pathogen and that
   species possessing an innate immunologic defense at the time of disease
   emergence are more likely to survive.},

Abstract = {Galagocheles Fain, 1979 (Acari: Cheyletidae), comprising permanent
   parasites of African prosimian primates (Galagonidae), is revised. An
   amended diagnosis of the genus based on characters of adults and
   immatures is given. The type-species, G. lemuricola (Lawrence, 1948),
   from Otolemur garnetti (Ogilby) (type-host) and O. crassicaudatus
   Geoffroy, is redescribed, and G. lawrencei n. sp. is described from
   Galago senegalensis Geoffroy (type-host) and G. moholi Smith. The new
   species differs from G. lemuricola by its smaller body size, the obtuse
   posterior end of the opisthosoma in males, and by fine, nude setae ps3
   in females. The systematics of the cheyletid tribe Niheliini and
   host-parasite associations of its species are briefly discussed. The
   tribe Criokerontini is included to the tribe Niheliini. It is suggested
   that the ancestors of the tribe Niheliini were predaceous cheyletids
   associated with the nests of arboreal mammals, and the association of
   Nihelia spp. on mongooses (Herpestidae) is the result of the
   host-switching from some ancient arboreal mammal.},

Title = {Aging and biological rhythms in primates},
Journal = {M S-MEDECINE SCIENCES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {279-283},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {All living organisms exhibit rhythmic activities in a wide variety of
   endocrine and behavioural parameters. These biological rhythms are
   endogenously generated by a circadian clock, and they are entrained by
   cyclic variations of environmental factors called synchronizers. Aging
   is associated with changes in amplitude and temporal organization of
   many daily and seasonal rhythms. In humans, daily rhythms of sleep,
   thermoregulation and hormonal secretion are severely altered with aging.
   Except in humans, studies on primates are scarce. However, age-related
   effects on biological rhythms are relatively consistent among primate
   species studied to date, including humans. Therefore,. non human
   primates are of valuable use for such investigations. Most studies have
   been performed on the Rhesus mocaque (longevity 35-40 years) and on the
   gray mouse lemur (longevity 10-12 years). Like in humans, the
   rest-activity rhythm becomes fragmented in aged primates, and shows on
   increased activity during the resting period. Aging induces a decrease
   in amplitude of the body temperature rhythm and an increase in energy
   consumption. Various hormonal secretions exhibit a decrease with aging,
   but the rhythmic components of these declines have not always been
   depicted. Moreover, changes (amplitude or phase) in daily variations
   depended of the hormonal secretion tested. Taken together, these results
   suggest that the biological clock in the brain would be a primary target
   of aging. The main central clock is located in the suprachicismatic
   nucleus of the hypothalamus whose endogenous oscillations are entrained
   by light. In this brain structure, cellular function and sensitivity to
   light show drastic changes with age in the mouse lemur. The precise
   knowledge of age-related alterations of biological rhythms in primates
   can have important consequences on the development of new treatments to
   maintain or restore biological rhythmicity in the elderly.},

Title = {Natural hybridization in primates: One evolutionary mechanism},
Journal = {ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {109},
Number = {4},
Pages = {261-276},
Abstract = {The role and importance of natural hybridization in the evolutionary
   histories of animal taxa is still debated. This results largely from a
   history of zoological investigations that assumed, rather than
   documented, a limited evolutionary role for this process. However, it is
   now becoming apparent that, just as for plants, the creative effects of
   reticulate evolution are widespread in animal taxa as well. This
   conclusion is supported by the documentation of numerous instances of
   the formation of new taxa and the genetic enrichment through
   introgressive hybridization. In the present review, we use primates as a
   paradigm for how natural hybridization can affect the evolution of
   species complexes and remains a footprint on genomes. Findings for a
   number of groups, including basal (e.g. lemurs) and derived (e.g. Old
   World apes) lineages, demonstrate that introgression and hybrid
   speciation have caused a reticulate pattern that is still detectable in
   the, often mosaic, genomes of primates. For example, results from
   genetic analyses of our own species demonstrate the process of past
   introgressive hybridization with the progenitors of our sister taxa
   (i.e. chimpanzees and gorillas) and most likely also our extinct, close
   relatives in the hominid lineage. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {This paper presents a new four-limbed robot, LEMUR IIb (Legged Excursion
   Mechanical Utility Rover), that can free-climb vertical rock surfaces.
   This robot was designed to have a number of capabilities in addition to
   climbing (e.g., assembly, inspection, maintenance, transport,
   intervention) and to be able to traverse a variety of other types of
   terrain (e.g., roads, talus, dirt, urban rubble). To maximize its
   flexibility in this regard, LEMUR IIb will need to exploit sophisticated
   control, planning, and sensing techniques in order to climb, rather than
   rely on specific hardware modifications. In particular, this paper
   describes a new algorithm for planning safe one-step climbing moves,
   which has already enabled LEMUR IIb to climb an indoor, near-vertical
   surface with small, arbitrarily distributed, natural features. To the
   authors' knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of a
   multi-use, multi-limbed robot climbing such terrain using only friction
   at contact points (i.e., free-climbing).},

Title = {Positive edge effects for arboreal marsupials: an assessment of
   potential mechanisms},
Journal = {WILDLIFE RESEARCH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {121-129},
Abstract = {In this study we examined the potential for positive edge effects on
   folivorous arboreal marsupials inhabiting upland rainforest in the Wet
   Tropics region of far north Queensland, Australia. We predicted that the
   folivores should have increased densities at edges relative to interior
   forest 90 m from the edge owing to the following causal factors, either
   separately or in combination: (a) increased foliar biomass, measured as
   vertical foliage density; and/or (b) increased abundance of preferred
   food trees. To test these hypotheses, we conducted surveys of the
   lemuroid ringtail possum (Hemibelideus lemuroides), the green ringtail
   possum (Pseudochirops archeri), the Herbert River ringtail possum
   (Pseudochirulus herbertensis) and the coppery brushtail possum
   (Trichosurus vulpecula johnstonii) at two remnant rainforest sites with
   `hard' edges such as roads or pasture. Because arboreal species are
   often difficult to survey accurately within forests, we utilised pellet
   counts as an index of the population and compared this to the common
   survey technique of night spotlighting. Our results indicated that
   pellet counts, combined over all species, were positively and strongly
   correlated with spotlighting results. Using pellet counts as a relative
   index of arboreal folivore populations, we found that edge transects
   contained a higher abundance of all species combined than did interior
   transects. Further, total foliage density in the 10-30-m vertical
   transect was found to be significantly correlated with total pellet
   counts at edge transects. Total preferred tree species was not
   significantly different between edge and interior transects. From these
   results we propose that foliage density, as a surrogate for biomass, is
   a possible mechanism explaining the higher abundance of arboreal
   marsupials at the edges of these two highland rainforest sites in north
   Queensland.},

Journal = {CELLS TISSUES ORGANS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {184},
Number = {2},
Pages = {96-101},
Abstract = {We examined the correlation between the density of muscle spindles in
   shoulder muscles and the locomotor mode in three species of prosimian
   primates: the slow loris ( Nycticebus coucang), Garnett's galago (
   Otolemur garnettii), and the ring-tailed lemur ( Lemur catta). The
   shoulder muscles ( supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres major, teres
   minor, and subscapularis) were embedded in celloidin and cut into
   transverse serial thin sections ( 40 mu m); then, every tenth section
   was stained using the Azan staining technique. The relative muscle
   weights and the density of the muscle spindles were determined. The slow
   loris muscles were heavier and had sparser muscle spindles, as compared
   to Garnett's galago. These features suggest that the shoulder muscles of
   the slow loris are more adapted to generating propulsive force and
   stabilizing the shoulder joint during locomotion and play a less
   controlling role in forelimb movements. In contrast, Garnett's galago
   possessed smaller shoulder muscles with denser spindles that are
   suitable for the control of more rapid locomotor movements. The mean
   relative weight and the mean spindle density in the shoulder muscles of
   the ring-tailed lemur were between those of the other primates,
   suggesting that the spindle density is not simply a consequence of
   taxonomic status. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships of gecarcinucoid freshwater crabs were
   investigated, based on morphology of the male second gonopod. In
   addition, a comparison of sequences from the mitochondrial large subunit
   rRNA gene helped to resolve the phylogeny of this group and
   relationships to other Old World freshwater crabs. As a result, we
   recognise two sister groups within the Gecarcinucoidea, the African
   Deckeniidae and the Asian Gecarcinucidae. Deckeniidae includes three
   monophyletic clades, the Deckeniinae in East Africa and on the
   Seychelles, the West African Globonautinae and the Malagasy
   Hydrothelphusinae. Gecarcinucidae comprises two sister groups, the
   Gecarcinucinae with representatives in Sri Lanka, India and southeast
   Asia, and the Parathelphusinae in India, southeast Asia, the Sundaic
   Islands and Australia. Interpretation of our phylogenetic results leads
   us to propose a new biogeographic hypothesis for the Gecarcinucoidea.
   Most likely, the gecarcinucoid freshwater crabs have an African origin;
   their distribution can be explained by successive events of dispersal.
   This model can be correlated with palaeogeographical and
   palaeoclimatological data for the Cenozoic, suggesting a gecarcinucoid
   dispersal to Asia via the ``Lemurian Stepping-Stones{''}, a chain of
   islands in the West-Indian Ocean that were emergent in times of low sea
   levels during the Oligocene. (c) 2006 Gesellschaft fur Biologische

Abstract = {In this paper we present the design and evaluation of our biomedical
   literature searching approaches using the TREC 2004 ad hoc retrieval
   task in the Genomics track. The main approach taken in our system is to
   expand queries by exploiting the three widely used strategies - local
   analysis, global analysis, and ontology-based term re-weighting across
   various search engines. The experimental results show that (4)
   ontology-based term re-weighting provides the best results among the
   three query expansion strategies, (2) expanding the initial query with
   more precise ontology-based term enhances LSI based local analysis
   substantially, and (3) including context to term re-weighting and LSI
   further improves the precision. Experimental results also show that the
   ontology-based term re-weighting with LUCENE or LEMUR search engines
   increases the average precision by up to 20.3\% or 12.1 \%,
   respectively, compared to that of the baseline runs. In addition, the
   LSI-based local analysis increases the average precision by 9.2\% with
   LEMUR search engine. We believe the approaches of the term re-weighting
   and LSI-based local analysis may be exploited in other bio-medical
   domains.},

Abstract = {Search engines have significantly improved the efficiency of bio-medical
   literature searching. These search engines, however, still return many
   results that are irrelevant to the intention of a user's query. To
   improve precision and recall, various query expansion strategies are
   widely used. In this paper, we explore the three widely used query
   expansion strategies local analysis, global analysis, and ontology-based
   term reweighting across various search engines. Through experiments, we
   show that ontology-based term re-weighting works best. Term re-weighting
   reformulates queries with selection of key original query terms and
   re-weights these key terms and their associated synonyms from UMLS. The
   results of experiments show that with LUCENE and LEMUR, the average
   precision is enhanced by up to 20.3\% and 12.1\%, respectively, compared
   to baseline runs. We believe the principles of this term re-weighting
   strategy may be extended and utilized in other bio-medical domains.},

Abstract = {Calcium-binding proteins are involved in numerous functional roles in
   the retina and are widely distributed in almost all retinal neurons. The
   present study aimed to characterize the distribution of the
   calcium-binding proteins calbindin, calretinin, parvalbumin and
   recoverin in relation to retinal cell types in a strepsirhine primate
   (mouse lemur, Microcebus) in comparison with primate species of the
   three main haplorhine lineages (marmoset, macaque and human), as well as
   a rodent (gerbil, Taterillus). The main findings show that whereas the
   recoverin antibody labels both rod and cone photoreceptors in all
   species, calbindin consistently labels cones, but not rods, in the
   haplorhine primates marmoset, macaque and human, but none of the
   photoreceptors in the mouse lemur. Marmoset and macaque also show a
   distinct label of cone outer segments with calretinin. Depending on the
   species, bipolar cells express calbindin and/or recoverin, while
   amacrine, horizontal and ganglion cells are labeled to varying degrees
   with calbindin, calretinin and parvalbumin. Haplorhine and strepsirhine
   primates clearly differ in the expression of calcium-binding protein
   expression in horizontal cells. In all haplorhine species, horizontal
   cells are densely labeled with parvalbumin whereas in mouse lemur
   horizontal cells express calbindin but not parvalbumin. Several
   characteristics of the calcium-binding immumostaining in the retina of
   the mouse lemur are similar to those observed in the rodent, and
   distinguish this species from the diurnal haphorhine primates. These
   differences may be related to adaptations of retinal structure and
   function to the nocturnal niche, since nocturnal strepsirhine and
   haphorhine (Tarsius and Aotus) primates share some features of
   calcium-binding expression. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All fights reserved.},

Abstract = {Sexual dimorphism in body size and canine weaponry is commonly
   associated with high levels of male-male competition. When group living
   species do not rely heavily on male-male competition for access to
   females, sperm competition may represent a viable alternative strategy.
   Unlike most haplorhine primates, lemurs are typically monomorphic in
   body weight and canine height. We assessed variability of body mass
   dimorphism and canine size dimorphism in brown lemurs using morphometric
   data from 3 populations in southeastern Madagascar: Eulemur fulvus
   rufus, E. albocollaris, and hybrids of the species. We found significant
   male-biased canine dimorphism in E. albocollaris in conjunction with
   body-size monomorphism. We observed similar patterns in the hybrids, but
   E. fulvus rufus exhibited significant female-biased size dimorphism and
   canine monomorphism. Testes volume was relatively high across study
   populations. Thus, sperm competition appears to be strong in brown
   lemurs. E. albocollaris males combine sperm competition with large
   canines, but not higher body mass, indicating a difference in sexual
   strategy from most lemurs. Patterns of body mass and canine size
   dimorphism are not uniform across brown lemur populations, indicating
   that future work on these populations can explicitly test models that
   predict relationships between size dimorphism and various types of
   competition.},

Abstract = {Studies of infant development and parental behavior in free-ranging owl
   monkeys have been constrained by their nocturnal habits. Taking
   advantage of the cathemeral activity pattern of Aotus azarai azarai in
   the Argentinean Chaco, we describe the development of a cohort of
   free-ranging infants born in an owl monkey population in Formosa
   Province. We observed 7 infants, whose birth dates are known to the
   nearest week, to record details of their development and care between
   October 1999 and March 2000. We collected 92 h of behavioral data in 76
   sessions. The infants were almost never off the parents during the first
   4 wk of life, and we observed no infant being transported by a nonadult.
   The parent carrying the infant traveled most frequently in the middle of
   the group, sometimes first, but rarely last. The mean duration of 33
   nursing episodes is 69 sec. After nursing, the infant was more likely to
   return to the nonnursing adult than to remain with the mother suggesting
   that in owl monkeys the infant may be primarily attached to the adult
   male in the group. Infants began to explore, to manipulate and to
   consume solid foods during the second month. Our observations are
   comparable to ones on captive breeding groups of Colombian owl monkeys
   (Aotus lemurinus) and Bolivian owl monkeys (A. azarai boliviensis) under
   controlled conditions of temperature, illumination and food
   availability.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was reactivation and adaptation of a strain of
   Plasmodium vivax to Aotus nancymai monkeys. A need arose for malarial
   parasites for use in serologic and molecular studies and for teaching
   slides. This particular strain of parasite had been characterized
   previously as producing high-density parasitemia in splenectomized New
   World monkeys and therefore represented a good candidate for
   reactivation. P. vivax (Vietnam II), isolated in 1970, was reactivated
   after adaptation in Aotus lemurinus griseimembra monkeys nearly 33 years
   earlier and adapted to A. nancymai monkeys. Passage was achieved by
   intravenous inoculation of parasite blood stages into splenectomized A.
   nancymai monkeys. Parasitemia was determined by analyzing daily blood
   smears stained with Giemsa. Maximum parasite counts ranged from 10,630
   to 94,000 parasites/mu l; the mean maximum parasite count for the four
   animals was 39,565 parasites/mu l. Parasite counts of > 10,000/mu l were
   maintained for 2 to 64 days. After only three passages of the parasite,
   attempts to reactive were successful. A nancymai proved a suitable
   animal model for the recovery of this parasite. In conclusion,
   successful reactivation and adaptation of this parasite offers the
   capability to perform a series of diagnostic, immunologic, and molecular
   studies as well as to provide otherwise potentially unavailable teaching
   materials to healthcare professionals.},

Abstract = {It is firmly believed that ancestral primates were nocturnal, with
   nocturnality having been maintained in most prosimian lineages. Under
   this traditional view, the opsin genes in all nocturnal prosimians
   should have undergone similar degrees of functional relaxation and
   accumulated similar extents of deleterious mutations. This expectation
   is rejected by the short-wavelength (S) opsin gene sequences from 14
   representative prosimians. We found severe defects of the S opsin gene
   only in lorisiforms, but no defect in five nocturnal and two diurnal
   lemur species and only minor defects in two tarsiers and two nocturnal
   lemurs. Further, the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous rate ratio of the S
   opsin gene is highest in the lorisiforms and varies among the other
   prosimian branches, indicating different time periods of functional
   relaxation among lineages. These observations suggest that the ancestral
   primates were diurnal or cathemeral and that nocturnality has evolved
   several times in the prosimians, first in the lorisiforms but much later
   in other lineages. This view is further supported by the distribution
   pattern of the middle-wavelength (M) and long-wavelength (L) opsin genes
   among prosimians.},

Abstract = {Madagascar harbors four large adaptive radiations of endemic terrestrial
   mammals: lemurs, tenrecs, carnivorans, and rodents. These rank among the
   most spectacular examples of evolutionary diversification, but their
   monophyly and origins are debated. The lack of Tertiary fossils from
   Madagascar leaves molecular studies as most promising to solve these
   controversies. We provide a simultaneous reconstruction of phylogeny and
   age of the four radiations based on a 3.5-kb data set from three nuclear
   genes (ADRA2B, vWF, and AR). The analysis supports each as a
   monophyletic clade, sister to African taxa, and thereby identifies four
   events of colonization out of Africa. To infer the time windows for
   colonization, we take into account both the divergence from the closest
   noninsular sister group and the initial intrainsular radiation, which is
   a novel but conservative approach in studies of the colonization history
   of Madagascar. We estimate that lemurs colonized Madagascar between 60
   million years ago (Mya) (split from lorises) and 50 Mya (lemur
   radiation) (70-41 Mya taking 95\% credibility intervals into account),
   tenrecs between 42 and 25 Mya (50-20 Mya), carnivorans between 26 and 19
   Mya (33-14 Mya), and rodents between 24 and 20 Mya (30-15 Mya). These
   datings suggest at least two asynchronous colonization events: by lemurs
   in the Late Cretaceous-Middle Eocene, and by carnivorans and rodents in
   the Early Oligocene-Early Miocene. The colonization by tenrecs may have
   taken place simultaneously with either of these two events, or in a
   third event in the Late Eocene-Oligocene. Colonization by at least
   lemurs, rodents, and carnivorans appears to have occurred by overseas
   rafting rather than via a land bridge hypothesized to have existed
   between 45 and 26 Mya, but the second scenario cannot be ruled out if
   credibility intervals are taken into account.},

Title = {Temporalis function in anthropoids and strepsirrhines: An EMG study},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {128},

Abstract = {The major purpose of this study is to analyze anterior and posterior
   temporalis muscle force recruitment and firing patterns in various
   anthropoid and strepsirrhine primates. There are two specific goals for
   this project. First, we test the hypothesis that in addition to
   transversely directed muscle force, the evolution of symphyseal fusion
   in primates may also be linked to vertically directed balancing-side
   muscle force during chewing (Hylander et al. {[}2000] Am. J. Phys.
   Anthropol. 112:469-492). Second, we test the hypothesis of whether
   strepsirrhines retain the hypothesized primitive mammalian condition for
   the firing of the anterior temporalis, whereas anthropoids have the
   derived condition (Weijs {[}1994] Biomechanics of Feeding in
   Vertebrates; Berlin: Springer-Verlag, p. 282-320). Electromyographic
   (EMG) activities of the left and right anterior and posterior temporalis
   muscles were recorded and analyzed in baboons, macaques, owl monkeys,
   thick-tailed galagos, and ring-tailed lemurs. In addition, as we used
   the working-side superficial masseter as a reference muscle, we also
   recorded and analyzed EMG activity of the left and right superficial
   masseter in these primates. The data for the anterior temporalis
   provided no support for the hypothesis that symphyseal fusion in
   primates is linked to vertically directed jaw muscle forces during
   mastication. Thus, symphyseal fusion in primates is most likely mainly
   linked to the timing and recruitment of transversely directed forces
   from the balancing-side deep masseter (Hylander et al. {[}2000] Am. J.
   Phys. Anthropol. 112:469-492). In addition, our data demonstrate that
   the firing patterns for the working- and balancing-side anterior
   temporalis muscles are near identical in both strepsirrhines and
   anthropoids. Their working- and balancing-side anterior temporalis
   muscles fire asynchronously and reach peak activity during the power
   stroke. Similarly, their working- and balancing-side posterior
   temporalis muscles also fire asynchronously and reach peak activity
   during the power stroke. Compared to these strepsirrhines, however, the
   balancing-side posterior temporalis of anthropoids appears to have a
   relatively delayed firing pattern. Moreover, based on their smaller W/B
   ratios, anthropoids demonstrate a relative increase in muscle-force
   recruitment of the balancing-side posterior temporalis. This in turn
   suggests that anthropoids may emphasize the duration and magnitude of
   the power stroke during mastication. This hypothesis, however, requires
   additional testing. Furthermore, during the latter portion of the power
   stroke, the late activity of the balancing-side posterior temporalis of
   anthropoids apparently assists the balancing-side deep masseter in
   driving the working-side molars through the terminal portion of
   occlusion.},

Title = {Hind limb proportions and kinematics: are small primates different from
   other small mammals?},

Abstract = {Similar in body size, locomotor behaviour and morphology to the last
   common ancestor of Primates, living small quadrupedal primates provide a
   convenient model for investigating the evolution of primate locomotion.
   In this study, the hind limb kinematics of quadrupedal walking in mouse
   lemurs, brown lemurs, cotton-top tamarins and squirrel monkeys are
   analysed using cineradiography. The scaling of hind limb length to body
   size and the intralimb proportions of the three-segmented hind limb are
   taken into consideration when kinematic similarities and differences are
   discussed.
   Hind limb kinematics of arboreal quadrupedal primates, ranging in size
   between 100 g and 3000 g, are size independent and resemble the hind
   limb kinematics of small non-cursorial mammals. A common feature seen in
   smaller mammals, in general, is the horizontal position of the thigh at
   touchdown and of the lower leg at lift-off. Thus, the maximum bone
   length is immediately transferred into the step length. The vertical
   position of the leg at the beginning of a step cycle and of the thigh at
   lift-off contributes the same distance to pivot height. Step length and
   pivot height increase proportionally with hind limb length, because
   intrallimb proportions of the hind limb remain fairly constant.
   Therefore, the strong positive allometric scaling of the hind limb in
   arboreal quadrupedal primates affects neither the kinematics of hind
   limb segments nor the total angular excursion of the limb. The angular
   excursion of the hind limb in quadrupedal primates is equal to that of
   other non-cursorial mammals. Hence, hind limb excursion in larger
   cercopithecine primates differs from that of other large mammals due to
   the decreasing angular excursion as part of convergent cursorial.
   adaptations in several phylogenetic lineages of mammals. Typical members
   of those phylogenetic groups are traditionally used in comparison with
   typical primates, and therefore the `uniqueness' of primate locomotor
   characteristics is often overrated.},

Abstract = {The monophyly of the Peltolphorum group, one of nine informal groups
   recognized by Polhill in the Caesalpinieae, was tested using sequence
   data from the trnL-F, rbcL, and rps16 regions of the chloroplast genome.
   Exemplars were included from all 16 genera of the Peltophorum group, and
   from 15 genera representing seven of the other eight informal groups in
   the tribe. The data were analyzed separately and in combined analyses
   using parsimony and Bayesian methods. The analysis method had little
   effect on the topology of well-supported relationships. The molecular
   data recovered a generally well-supported phylogeny with many
   intergeneric relationships resolved. Results show that the Peltophorum
   group as currently delimited is polyphyletic, but that eight genera plus
   one undescribed genus form a core Peltophorum group, which is referred
   to here as the Peltophorum group sensu stricto. These genera are Bussea.

   Parkinsonia, Peltophorum, and Schizolobium. The remaining eight genera
   of the Peltophortan group s.l. are distributed across the Caesalpinieae.
   Morphological Support for the redelimited Peltophorum group and the
   other recovered clades was assessed, and no unique synapomorphy was
   found for the Peltophorum group s.s. A proposal for the reclassification
   of the Peltophorum group s.l. is presented.},

Abstract = {Major aspects of lorisid phylogeny and systematics remain unresolved,
   despite several studies (involving morphology, histology, karyology,
   immunology, and DNA sequencing) aimed at elucidating them. Our study is
   the first to investigate the evolution of this enigmatic group using
   molecular and morphological data for all four well-established genera:
   Arctocebus, Loris, Nyeticebus, and Perodicticus. Data sets consisting of
   386 bp of 12S rRNA, 535 bp of 16S rRNA, and 36 craniodental characters
   were analyzed separately and in combination, using maximum parsimony and
   maximum likelihood. Outgroups, consisting of two galagid taxa (Otolemur
   and Galagoides) and a lemuroid (Microcebus), were also varied. The
   morphological data set yielded a paraphyletic lorisid clade with the
   robust Nyeticebus and Perodicticus grouped as sister taxa, and the
   galagids allied with Aretocebus. All molecular analyses maximum
   parsimony (MP) or maximum likelihood (ML) which included Microcebus as
   an outgroup rendered a paraphyletic lorisid clade, with one exception:
   the 12S + 16S data set analyzed with ML. The position of the galagids in
   these paraphyletic topologies was inconsistent, however, and bootstrap
   values were low. Exclusion of Microcebus generated a monophyletic
   Lorisidae with Asian and African subclades; bootstrap values for all
   three clades in the total evidence tree were over 90\%. We estimated
   mean genetic distances for lemuroids vs. lorisoids, lorisids vs.
   galagids, and Asian vs. African lorisids as a guide to relative
   divergence times. We present information regarding a temporary land
   bridge that linked the two now widely separated regions inhabited by
   lorisids that may explain their distribution. Finally, we make taxonomic
   recommendations based on our results. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {BC200 RNA, a neuronal, small non-messenger RNA that originated from a
   monomeric Alu element is specific to anthropoid primates. Tarsiers lack
   an insert at the orthologous genomic position, whereas strepsirrhines
   (Lemuriformes and Lorisiformes) acquired a dimeric Alu element,
   independently from anthropoids. In Galago moholi, the CpG dinucleotides
   are conspicuously conserved, while in Eulemur coronatus a large
   proportion is changed, indicating that the G. moholi Alu is under
   purifying selection and might be transcribed. Indeed, Northern blot
   analysis of total brain RNA from G. moholi with a specific probe
   revealed a prominent signal. In contrast, a corresponding signal was
   absent from brain RNA from E. coronatus. Isolation and sequence analysis
   of additional strepsirrhine loci confirmed the differential sequence
   conservation including CpG patterns of the orthologous dimeric Alu
   elements in Lorisiformes and Lemuriformes. Interestingly, all examined
   Alu elements from Lorisiformes were transcribed, while all from
   Lemuriformes were silent when transiently transfected into HeLa cells.
   Upstream sequences, especially those between the transcriptional start
   site and -22 upstream, were important for basal transcriptional
   activity. Thus, the BC200 RNA gene locus attracted two independent Alu
   insertions during its evolutionary history and provided upstream
   promoter elements required for their transcription. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {The aim of the studies was to determine the dynamics and progress of
   amyloidosis-P and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in various 7 to
   33-year-old monkeys. Tissue samples from the brains were fixed in 10\%
   neutral formalin and embedded in paraffin by a routine procedure.
   Sections 7 m were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Nissl, Congo red,
   Bielschowsky, Tioflavin S, and monoclonal antibodies (4G8 mAb).
   Neurofibrillary tangles were stained with anti-TAU monoclonal antibody.
   Senile plaques were revealed in six of 11 monkeys. All three types of
   plaque were present, but the primitive form was strongly predominant.
   Neuritic plaques (primitive and classical) were seen in frontal,
   temporal, parietal and occipital cortices. Particularly diffuse types of
   plaque were found in a Lemur mongoz brain. Congofilic angiopathy (CAA)
   was observed in meningeal and cortical vessels of six monkeys above
   19-years-of-age. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and neurofibrfllary
   threads were observed in dendrites and axons of CA1 neurons, CA3
   hippocarnpal formation and temporal cortex in two monkeys only with the
   mAb Tau-1 method (Cebus apella, aged 23, and Lemur mongoz,
   22-years-old). The study revealed that brain aging in monkeys is marked
   by an increasing number of preamyloid deposits in the neuropil and by
   CAA of the leptomeningeal and parenchymal vessels.},

Journal = {GENE},

Volume = {352},

Abstract = {We previously discovered Y-chromosomal red-green opsin genes in two
   types of owl monkeys with different chromosomal characteristics. in one
   type, the Y-linked opsin gene is a single-copy intact gene and in the
   other, the genes exist as multiple pseudogenes on a Y/autosome fusion
   chromosome. In the present study, we first distinguished the two types
   of monkeys as distinct allopatric species on the basis of karyotypic
   characteristics: Aotus lemurinus griseimembra (Karyotype III, diploid
   chromosome number {[}2n] = 53) and Aotus azarae boliviensis (Karyotype
   VI; male 2n = 49; female 2n = 50), belonging to the northern and
   southern species groups, respectively, separated by the Amazon River
   system. Our sequence analysis revealed a common L1-Alu-Alu insertion
   between the two species in the 3'-flanking region of the X-linked opsin
   genes. The insertion was absent in the Y-linked opsin genes and in the
   human red and green opsin genes, indicating that it occurred in the X
   copy before the split into northern and southern species and after the X
   to Y duplication, i.e. duplication preceded speciation. We also show
   that in the northern species, the Y-linked opsin gene has evolved
   concomitantly with the X-linked copy whereas in the southern species,
   the Y-autosome fusion possibly led to decoupling evolutionary processes
   between X- and Y-linked copies and subsequent degeneration and
   duplications of the Y-linked opsin gene. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The main and accessory olfactory systems of certain mammals (e.g.,
   rodents, ungulates, and carnivores) have been investigated using lectin
   histochemistry to probe for sugar residues that may reflect
   physiological aspects of signal transduction or development.
   Morphologically, the vomeronasal organs (VNOs) of strepsirrhine primates
   (lemurs and lorises) are typical of functional VNOs in other mammals,
   whereas in humans and chimpanzees the VNOs appear vestigial. However,
   the human VNO is considered functional by some authors. To elucidate the
   cellular nature of the VNO in human and chimpanzees, a panel of six
   lectins (Con-A, ECL, PNA, RCA, s-WGA, and UEA-1) was applied to the VNO
   in eight species of primates, including humans and chimpanzees. The
   results indicated that there were few, if any, lectin-reactive cells in
   the human or chimpanzee VNO that resembled those seen in the vomeronasal
   neuroepithelium in other primates. The overall pattern of lectin
   reactivity in the human and chimpanzee VNO is unlike that seen in
   mammals with chemosensory VNOs, suggesting that the VNO of these
   hominoids does not function similarly to that of other primates. (c)

Abstract = {An almost complete articulated skeleton of Apatemys chardini is
   described from the Fossil Butte Member (Green River Formation, uppermost
   lower Eocene, Late Wasatchian NALMA, Lostcabinian subage), in
   southwestern Wyoming. The animal has a head-and-body length of about 15
   cm and a tall length of 21 cm. It shows clear adaptations for arboreal
   habits. The hands are highly specialized, with elongated digits II and
   III suited for extracting wood-boring insects from bark and crevices.
   Apatemys shows a close relationship to the European Heterohyus from
   Messel, which is a few million years younger and shows a somewhat higher
   degree of specialization in the hand structure. Close similarities in
   the highly specialized dentition and the elongation of the same fingers
   indicate that the apatemyids from North America and Europe shared the
   same dietary adaptation for feeding on wood-boring larvae, exploiting an
   ecological niche now occupied by woodpeckers in most parts of the world.
   Among extant mammals only the marsupial Dactylopsila in New Guinea and
   northeastern Australia and the lemur Daubentonia in Madagascar forage in
   this way.},

Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV), an arthropod-borne virus belonging to the family
   Flaviviridae, had been recognized in Africa, Asia and the south of
   Europe for many decades. Only recently, it has been associated with an
   increasing number of outbreaks of encephalitis in humans and equines as
   well as an increasing number of infections in vertebrates of a wide
   variety of species. In this article, the data available on the incidence
   of WNV in vertebrates are reviewed. Moreover, the role of vertebrates in
   the transmission of WNV, the control of WNV infections in veterinary
   medicine as well as future perspectives are discussed. A wide variety of
   vertebrates, including more than 150 bird species and at least 30 other
   vertebrate species, are susceptible to WNV infection. The outcome of
   infection depends on the species, the age of the animal, its immune
   status and the pathogenicity of the WNV isolate. WNV infection of
   various birds, especially passeriforms, but also of young chickens and
   domestic geese, results in high-titred viremia that allows
   arthropod-borne transmission. For other vertebrate species, only lemurs,
   lake frogs and hamsters develop suitable viremia levels to support
   arthropod-borne transmission. The role of vertebrates in direct,
   non-arthropod-borne transmission, such as via virus-contaminated organs,
   tissues or excretions is less well characterized. Even though direct
   transmission can occur among vertebrates of several species, data are
   lacking on the exact amounts of infectious virus needed. Finally, the
   increased importance of WNV infections has led to the development of
   killed, live-attenuated, DNA-recombinant and chimeric veterinary
   vaccines.},

   (11.2\%) were neglected. with the exception of Lemuridae (9.8\%).
   Projects were categorised according to their possible application,
   conservation (12\%). conservation/welfare (59.4\%), and welfare
   (28.6\%). The types of projects conducted in American zoos compared to
   those in Britain and Ireland differed, with more physiological studies
   taking place in America, while most research in British and Irish zoos
   was behavioural. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The evolutionary history of human chromosome 20 in primates was
   investigated using a panel of human BAC/PAC probes spaced along the
   chromosome. Oligonucleotide primers derived from the sequence of each
   human clone were used to screen horse, cat, pig, and black lemur BAC
   libraries to assemble, for each species, a panel of probes mapping to
   chromosomal loci orthologous to the loci encompassed by the human BACs.
   This approach facilitated marker-order comparison aimed at defining
   marker arrangement in primate ancestor. To this goal, we also took
   advantage of the mouse and rat draft sequences. The almost perfect
   colinearity of chromosome 20 sequence in humans and mouse could be
   interpreted as evidence that their form was ancestral to primates.
   Contrary to this view, we found that horse, macaque, and two New World
   monkeys share the same marker-order arrangement from which the human and
   mouse forms can be derived, assuming similar but distinct inversions
   that fully account for the small difference in marker arrangement
   between humans and mouse. The evolutionary history of this chromosome
   unveiled also two centromere repositioning events in New World monkey
   species.},

Abstract = {Because the spatial arrangements of nocturnal prosimians are often used
   to indicate their social systems, it is important to assess the
   reliability of methods used to analyze ranging patterns. We compared
   methods of home range analysis for 2 species of nocturnal prosimians:
   central pottos ( Perodicticus potto edwardsi) and Cross River Allen's
   galagos (Sciurocheirus cameronensis). We conducted radio-tracking
   studies of 10 pottos and 8 galagos from October 1999-November 2000 in
   the montane rain forests of southwest Cameroon. We calculated home
   ranges via minimum convex polygon (MCPs) and kernel analyses. Adult
   potto home ranges averaged 145.2 ha ( MCPs) versus only 28.4 ha via
   kernel analysis; the difference is statistically significant. The mean
   home range of galagos is 18.3 ha via MCPs and 2.19 ha via kernel
   analysis; the difference is statistically significant. Neither MCP nor
   kernel analyses revealed a sex difference in adult home ranges for
   pottos and galagos. Kernel analysis gave more reliable estimates of home
   ranges than the minimum convex polygon method used in many studies of
   nocturnal prosimians. Minimum convex polygon analysis tended to
   overestimate the range sizes and to include many areas not traversed by
   the animal. We compared our findings with those from an earlier study of
   similar species in Gabon, where little attention was given to the home
   range analysis technique. Together with studies of lemur spatial systems
   they highlight the importance of considering the method of home range
   analysis when it is to be applied to understanding social systems.},

Abstract = {Dynamics of the introduced tree Litsea glutinosa (Lauraceae) in Mayotte
   Island.. Is it an invasive species? - Litsea glutinosa (Lour.) C.B. Rob,
   the Indian laurel, is a dioecious tree from Australasia which has been
   introduced on Mayotte and has proliferated during the era of sugar cane
   plantations (1841-1880). Efficiently dispersed by the Brown Lemur
   (Eulemur fulvus) and by numerous birds. this Lauraceae species now
   spreads into the humid area and it is present in the last remaining
   ``natural{''} fragmented forests of the island. This tree, ranging from
   10 to 15 meters in height, is mostly found on the wetter (rainfall > 1
   500 nim/year) northern part of the island. This study analyses the
   population dynamics of Listea glutinosa between 1996 and 2002 in the
   remains of the mesophilous and ornbrophilous forests, as well as the
   importance of vegetative reproduction in certain populations. L.
   glutinosa proliferates in protected forests, particularly in semi-dry
   forests where it can take advantage of the more open forest structure.
   Because of its light-demanding temperament, L. glutinosa needs an
   opening in the forest canopy to settle down and grow. The tree's
   invading nature, however, is due partially to its capability to
   reproduce vegetatively; over half of the stems are produced by
   vegetative reproduction, mostly root-suckering. This species could lead
   to a specific loss of biodiversity in ``natural{''} areas, but is not
   considered as a pest by local inhabitants, because of its frequent
   utilization, especially as fodder.},

Abstract = {A new biarmosuchian therapsid, Lobalopex mordax gen. and sp. nov., from
   the Permian Teekloof Formation (Tropidostoma Assemblage Zone) of the
   Victoria West District, South Africa, is described on the basis of a
   partial skull with lower jaws and the first four cervical vertebrae. The
   genus is diagnosed by the following autapomorphies: median nasal
   eminence low and ridge-like; supraorbital boss small and unpachyostosed;
   posteriorly projecting supratemporal `horns' present but relatively
   small; ventral surface of transverse flange of pterygoid edentulous and
   sharply ridged; and laterally-directed knob present lateral to contact
   between pterygoid and palatine dentigerous bosses. As in some other
   biarmosuchians, the cervical vertebrae are elongated, being roughly
   twice as long as they are wide or deep. A cladistic analysis including
   ten biarmosuchian taxa indicates that Lobalopex is the sister taxon to
   Burnetiidae and that Lemurosaurus is the most primitive burnetiamorph.
   These results fail to provide evidence for geographic endemism in these
   groups of Middle to Late Permian therapsids.},

Abstract = {Molecular sexing of mammals is normally done by PCR amplification of Y
   chromosomal fragments, or coamplification of homologous fragments from
   both sex chromosomes. Existing primers are often unreliable for
   distantly related species due to mutations in primer regions. Currently
   there are no published primers for the sexing of prosimian DNA. We show
   that an existing method (using the zinc finger protein) based on a size
   difference between the X and Y homologs does not work in prosimians.
   Multiple alignments of distantly related mammalian species from Genbank
   and genome databases enabled us to identify conserved regions in the
   amelogenin gene. Using these conserved regions, we can target species
   that have no sequence information. We designed a single, conserved
   primer pair that is useful for fast and reliable molecular sexing of
   prosimian primates. A single PCR yields two fragments in males and only
   one in females, which are easily separated with the use of agarose gels.
   Amplification of separable fragments was successful in seven species of
   lemurs, as well as humans. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Unique proximal tibial morphology in strepsirrhine primates},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {293-308},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although the morphology of the tibial plateau in primates has received
   very little attention in the literature, it does exhibit features of
   phylogenetic and functional interest. This paper describes the
   morphology of the tibial plateau (particularly the intercondylar region)
   in extant and fossil primates, and in three mammalian outgroups: the
   pen-tailed tree shrew (Ptilocercus), tree shrew (Tupaia), and flying
   lemur or dermopteran (Cynocephalus). Extant and fossil strepsirrhine
   primates exhibit an eminence with a single spine, which contrasts with
   the intercondylar morphology of haplorhine primates. Most extant
   platyrrhines, all catarrhine primates (including humans), and some
   fossil haplorhines possess an eminence with two spines (medial and
   lateral) connected by a ridge of bone that intersects the intercondylar
   groove. Tarsius and callitrichines possess an eminence with a reduced
   medial spine that superficially resembles that of strepsirrhine
   primates. Dermopterans also exhibit a morphology similar to that of
   strepsirrhines. In Scandentia, the intercondylar morphology of Tupaia is
   similar to that of rodents, whereas Ptilocercus resembles tarsiers and
   callitrichines. We hypothesize that proximal tibiae with either a single
   spine or reduced medial spine morphology facilitate a greater degree of
   knee rotation about the eminence relative to the double-spine condition,
   and are likely associated with more frequent adoption of vertical body
   positions. In contrast, a double-spine eminence limits knee rotation and
   is probably associated with greater use of horizontal supports. Although
   the polarity is complicated by the unknown phylogenetic status of likely
   sister taxa, it seems most probable that the single-spine morphology is
   a derived feature of strepsirrhines. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The expansion of fatal neurodegenerative diseases, mostly bovine
   spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jacob
   disease (vCJD), is leading to an increase in our knowledge of the zoo
   primate spongiform encephalopathy (ZPSE). These diseases require the
   combined presence of the normal prion protein (PrP) and abnormal prion
   protein (PrPsc). In 1996 spongiform encephalopathy was described in
   macaque rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and lemurs (Eulemur fulvus
   mayottensis) living in the zoological park of Montpellier and later ZPSE
   was diagnosed in primates living in other French zoos. Persistent
   behavioral changes and gliosis were discovered in the gray matter,
   particularly in the cerebral cortex. Immunohistochemical examination
   revealed a strong accumulation of PrPSC in the tonsils, brain,
   gastrointestinal tract, the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and
   the spleen in primates suffering from SPSE. The exact mechanism of
   transmission of PrPSC from the lymphoreticular system to the central
   nervous system has not been precisely defined. All sick animals showed a
   progressive neurological disorder with behavioral abnormalities,
   physical deterioration and death. The data confirmed the ability of the
   BSE agent to cross the species barrier and its infectivity regarding the
   primates after oral or intracerebral exposure.},

Abstract = {The present study was aimed at adapting an automated olfactometer
   designed for use with rodents to a nocturnal lemur Microcebus murinus.
   This apparatus allows rigorous control of odor stimuli. We show that M
   murinus could remain quiet and attentive for about 20 min in the test
   chamber, allowing daily sessions of 40 consecutive trials. This allowed
   us to train M murinus subjects to learn a go/no-go discrimination
   procedure using fruity-odor cues. Each of seven subjects reached or
   exceeded a criterion of 33 correct responses in a block of 40 trials in
   a range of 4-14 training sessions. When trained on an odor reversal
   task, performance initially dropped sharply, followed by rapid
   acquisition of the new task. These outcomes demonstrate that, like
   rodents, M. murinus can be trained using operant conditioning in an
   automated olfactometer. This species should prove useful for
   investigating cognitive capacities and neurodegenerative disease in a
   primitive primate model. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We report on a comparative molecular cytogenetic and in silico study on
   evolutionary changes in human chromosome 7 homologs in all major primate
   lineages. The ancestral mammalian homologs comprise two chromosomes (7a
   and 7b/16p) and are conserved in carnivores. The subchromosomal
   organization of the ancestral primate segment 7a shared by a lemur and
   higher Old World monkeys is the result of a paracentric inversion. The
   ancestral higher primate chromosome form was then derived by a fission
   of 7b/16p, followed by a centric fusion of 7a/7b as observed in the
   orangutan. In hominoids two further inversions with four distinct
   breakpoints were described in detail: the pericentric inversion in the
   human/African ape ancestor and the paracentric inversion in the common
   ancestor of human and chimpanzee. FISH analysis employing BAC probes
   confined the 7p22.1 breakpoint of the pericentric inversion to 6.8 Nib
   on the human reference sequence map and the 7q22.1 breakpoint to 97.1
   Mb. For the paracentric inversion the breakpoints were found in 7q11.23
   between 76.1 and 76.3 Mb and in 7q22.1 at 101.9 Mb. All four breakpoints
   were flanked by large segmental duplications. Hybridization patterns of
   breakpoint-flanking BACs and the distribution of duplicons suggest their
   presence before the origin of both inversions. We propose a scenario by
   which segmental duplications may have been the cause rather than the
   result of these chromosome rearrangements. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Large-scale comparisons might reveal matching between fruit traits and
   frugivore assemblages that might be cryptic on a local scale. Therefore,
   we compared morphological (colour, size, husk thickness) and chemical
   fruit traits (protein, nitrogen, sugar, lipid, tannin and fibre content)
   between Malagasy and South African tree communities with different
   frugivore communities. In Madagascar, where lemurs are important seed
   dispersers, we found more tree species with fruit colour classified as
   ``primate fruits{''}. In contrast, in South Africa we found more tree
   species with fruits classified as ``bird coloured{''}. This correlated
   with the greater importance of frugivorous birds in South Africa vs.
   Madagascar. Additionally, we found higher sugar concentrations in fruits
   from the South African tree community and higher fibre content in fruits
   from the Malagasy tree community. However, fibre content could be
   related to differences in abiotic conditions between the two study
   sites. This suggests that fruit colour more than other morphological and
   chemical fruit traits, reflects food selection by the different
   frugivore assemblages of those two sites.},

   report the discovery and characterization of several previously unknown

   members from hosts which were not previously known to harbor
   betaretroviruses, such as the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) and
   Seba's short-tailed bat (Carollia perspicillata). Some of the mouse and
   rat elements possess intact open reading frames for gag, pro, pol,

   their murid hosts, have occasionally been transmitted to other species.},

Abstract = {Zoochory is the most common mode of seed dispersal for the majority of
   plant species in the tropics. Based on the assumption of tight
   plant-animal interactions several hypotheses have been developed to
   investigate the origin of life history traits of plant diaspores and
   their dispersers, such as species-specific co-evolution, the low/high
   investment model (low investment in single fruits but massive fruiting
   to attract many different frugivores versus high investment in single
   fruits and fruit production for extended periods to provide food for few
   frugivores), and the evolution of syndromes which represent plant
   adaptations to disperser groups (e.g. birds, mammals, mixed). To test
   these hypotheses the dispersal strategies of 34 tree species were
   determined in the littoral forest of Sainte Luce (SE-Madagascar) with
   the help of fruit traps and tree watches. The impact of fruit consumers
   on the seeds was determined based on detailed behavioral observations.
   Phenological, morphological and biochemical fruit traits from tree
   species were measured to look for co-variation with different types of
   dispersal. No indication for species-specific co-evolution could be
   found nor any support for the low/high investment model. However
   dispersal syndromes could be distinguished as diaspores dispersed by
   birds, mammals or both groups (mixed) differ in the size of their fruits
   and seeds, fruit shape, and seed number, but not in biochemical traits.
   Five large-seeded tree species seem to depend critically on the largest
   lemur, Eulemur fulvus collaris, for seed dispersal. However, this does
   not represent a case of tight species-specific co-evolution. Rather it
   seems to be the consequence of the extinction of the larger frugivorous
   birds and lemurs which might also have fed on these large fruits.
   Nevertheless these interactions are of crucial importance to conserve
   the integrity of the forest.},

Volume = {124},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The first third (ca. 1200 bp) of exon 1 of the nuclear gene encoding the
   interstitial retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) has been sequenced for 12
   representative primates belonging to Lemuriformes, Lorisiformes,
   Tarsiiformes, Platyrrhini, and Catarrhini, and combined with available
   data (13 other primates, 11 nonprimate placentals, and 2 marsupials).
   Phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood on nucleotides and amino
   acids robustly support the monophyly of primates, Strepsirrhini,
   Lemuriformes, Lorisiformes, Anthropoidea, Catarrhini, and Platyrrhini.
   It is interesting to note that 1) Tarsiidae grouped with Anthropoidea,
   and the support for this node depends on the molecular characters
   considered; 2) Cheirogaleidae grouped within Lemuriformes; and 3)
   Daubentonia was the sister group of all other Lemuriformes. Study of the
   IRBP evolutionary rate shows a high heterogeneity within placentals and
   also within primates. Maximum likelihood local molecular clocks were
   assigned to three clades displaying significantly contrasted
   evolutionary rates. Paenungulata were shown to evolve 2.5-3 times faster
   than Perissodactyla and Lemuriformes. Six independent calibration points
   were used to estimate splitting ages of the main primate clades, and
   their compatibility was evaluated. Divergence ages were obtained for the
   following crown groups: 13.8-14.2 MY for Lorisiformes, 26.5-27.2 MY for
   Lemuroidea, 39.6-40.7 MY for Lemuriformes, 45.4-46.7 MY for
   Strepsirrhini, and 56.7-58.4 MY for Haplorrhini. The incompatibility
   between some paleontological and molecular estimates may reflect the
   incompleteness of the placental fossil record, and/or indicate that the
   variable IRBP evolutionary rates are not fully accommodated by local
   molecular clocks. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Ontogenetic observations on the vomeronasal organ in two species of

Abstract = {Callitrichid primates (tamarins, marmosets) have extreme variation in
   the vomeronasal organ (VNO), including ontogenetic differences in the
   neuroepithelium and vomeronasal duct (VND) patency at birth. Such
   differences render the timing and extent of VNO maturation debatable in
   callitrichids, but no studies have used neuron-specific
   immunohistochemical markers to address this question. The present study
   compared the number of VNO epithelial cells that express
   immunoreactivity to neuron-specific beta-tubulin III (BT), VNO length,
   and VNO cross-sectional area between two species of tamarins
   (Leontopithecus rosalia and Saguinus geoffroyi) that differed in
   perinatal VND patency. Neonatal lemurs and adult marmosets and
   bushbabies were also examined for a comparison to species previously
   shown to have a relatively large amount of VNO neuroepithelium and
   patent VNDs. The head of each specimen was serially sectioned in the
   coronal plane. Based on known rostrocaudal start/stop points of the VNO,
   selected unstained sections were used for BT protocols and area
   measurement at three percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th) in each specimen.
   Each section was photographed and enlarged for cell counts and
   measurement of cross-sectional epithelial area. In each specimen, the
   number of BT+ cells in the VNO was counted at each percentile and
   expressed as a number per mm(2). Results indicated that lemur VNOs had a
   dense population of BT- cells at birth, but the VNO was more varied in
   the tamarin species. S. geoffroyi had few or no BT+ cells in VNOs of
   neonates, which had fused VNDs, but had an increased BT+ population by 1
   and 2 months postnatal age, when the VND was patent. Of the species with
   patent VNDs at birth, neonatal L. rosalia had a denser population of BT+
   cells compared to S. geoffroyi, though not to the degree seen in
   neonatal lemurs or adult marmosets and bushbabies. These findings show
   that BT immunohistochemistry is a useful comparative method for the
   study of VNOs in subadult primates. Since the quantity of nonsensory VNO
   epithelium varies substantially between species, epithelial area
   measurements may be misleading, and BT cell counts appeared to be the
   best quantitative method for comparing receptor neuron numbers among
   primates. It is suggested that the greater BT+ cell population in L.
   rosalia at all subadult stages examined reveals an earlier maturation of
   the neuroepithelium compared to S. geoffroyi. Further investigation
   should consider whether this may relate to a comparatively brief
   subadult ontogeny and early onset of adult behaviors in L. rosalia
   compared to other tamarins studied to date. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {From an evolutionary perspective, ``insectivores{''} have been one of
   the most important mammalian groups for over a century. Morphologists
   have successively pruned flying lemurs, elephant shrews, and tree shrews
   from Insectivora, but have retained chrysochlorids, tenrecs, erinaceids,
   soricids, talpids, and solenodontids in crown-group Lipotyphla. With the
   appearance of large molecular data sets, the monophyly of Lipotyphla has
   proved untenable. Rather, an emerging consensus is that Lipotyphla is a
   diphyletic taxon comprised of two monophyletic groups, Afrosoricida and
   Eulipotyphla. A recent paper by Malia et al. {[}Mol. Phylogenet. Evol.
   24 (2002) 91-101] challenged this view and argued that ``While the data
   {[}Growth Hormone Receptor] were unable to support the orders
   Lipotyphla, Eulipotyphla, and Tenrecoidea {[} = Afrosoricida] this was
   most likely due to the polyphyly of these groups and not to problems
   associated with the gene itself such as saturation or highly divergent
   sequences...{''} (p. 100). We analyzed Malia et al.'s original GHR data
   set (at both nuclear and protein level), an expanded GHR data set that
   included 49 additional sequences, and a concatenated data set that
   included GHR, BRCA1, vWF, and A2AB for a diverse selection of
   lipotyphlan taxa. Although protein analyses proved inconclusive, all
   analyses at the DNA level clearly show that the statement of Malia et
   al. is erroneous. Indeed, likelihood analyses with GHR and with the
   concatenated data set provide more support for Eulipotyphla and
   Afrosoricida than for competing hypotheses. These results also highlight
   the potential pitfalls of single-gene and parsimony-only analyses. (C)

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {58},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Mammals are basically dichromatic in color vision, possessing middle to
   long wave-sensitive (M/LWS) and the short wave-sensitive (SWS) cone
   opsins in the retina, whereas some nocturnal mammals lack functional SWS
   opsins. Prosimians, primitive primates consisting of three extant groups
   (Lorisiformes, Lemuriformes, and Tarsiiformes), include many nocturnal
   species. Among nocturnal prosimians, a species of lorisiforms, the
   greater galago (Otolemur crassicaudatus), is known to lack a functional
   SWS opsin gene, while lemuriforms and tarsiiforms appear to retain SWS
   opsins in the retina. It has not been established, however, whether the
   loss of SWS opsin is a universal phenomenon among lorisiforms and
   whether the functional SWS opsin genes of lemuriforms and tarsiiforms
   are under strict or relaxed selective constraint. To gain better insight
   into an association between nocturnality and loss of SWS function, we
   isolated and sequenced the SWS opsin genes from two species of
   lorisiforms, the slow loris (Nycticebus coucang; nocturnal) and the
   lesser galago (Galago senegalensis; nocturnal), and one species each of
   lemuriforms and tarsiiforms, the brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus;
   cathemeral) and the western tarsier (Tarsius bancanus; nocturnal),
   respectively. Our sequence analysis revealed that (1) the SWS opsin gene
   was disrupted in the common ancestor of galagids and lorisids and (2)
   the rate of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution has been kept
   significantly lower than that of synonymous substitution in tarsier and
   lemur, demonstrating the presence of strict selective constraint on the
   SWS opsin genes in tarsiiforms and lemuriforms.},

Abstract = {Since November 1997 the Madagascar Fauna Group (MFG) has released 13
   captive-bred black and white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata variegata)
   into the Betampona reserve in eastern Madagascar. Five of the thirteen
   are currently surviving, including one male who has integrated into a
   wild group. Five of the released lemurs fell victim to predation by
   fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), one died of malnutrition, one disappeared
   from the reserve and one was withdrawn from the release programme. Ten
   of the released lemurs survived for more than one year post release,
   although all required varying levels of supplementary feeding. One pair
   bred twice-the first time the infants did not survive, but on the second
   occasion triplets were successfully raised beyond weaning. One of the
   triplets (male) is still surviving. One male has integrated into a wild
   group and sired a single infant in 2002 and a female released in 2001
   gave birth to twins sired by a wild male also in 2002. The release
   programme has thus achieved a major objective of reinforcing the
   existing wild population. To date there is no significant difference in
   survival rates between animals born and raised in free-ranging
   environments and those raised in cages, between animals greater than or
   less than 5 years old at time of release, or between males and females.

Abstract = {The cardiovascular risk factor LPA has a puzzling distribution among

   history of LPA, we performed extensive genomic sequence comparisons of
   multiple species with and without an LPA gene product, such as human,
   baboon, hedgehog, lemur, and mouse. This analysis indicated that LPA
   arose independently in a subset of primates, including baboon and human,
   and an insectivore, the hedgehog, and was not simply lost by species
   lacking it. The similar structural domains shared by the hedgehog and
   primate LPA indicate that they were formed by a unique molecular
   mechanism involving the convergent evolution of paralogous genes in
   these distant species. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper we show how relevance feedback can be used to improve
   retrieval performance for a cross language image retrieval task through
   query expansion. This area of CLIR is different from existing problems,
   but has thus far received little attention from CLIR researchers. Using
   the ImageCLEF test collection, we simulate user interaction with a CL
   image retrieval system, and in particular the situation in which a user
   selects one or more relevant images from the top n. Using textual
   captions associated with the images, relevant images are used to create
   a feedback model in the Lemur language model for information retrieval,
   and our results show that feedback is beneficial, even when only one
   relevant document is selected. This is particularly useful for cross
   language retrieval where problems during translation can result in a
   poor initial ranked list with few relevant in the top n. We find that
   the number of feedback documents and the influence of the initial query
   on the feedback model most affect retrieval performance.},

Abstract = {Olfactory receptor (OR) genes constitute the molecular basis for the

   the process of degeneration of the olfactory repertoire in primates, we
   estimated the proportion of OR pseudogenes in 19 primate species by
   surveying randomly chosen subsets of 100 OR genes from each species. We
   find that apes, Old World monkeys and one New World monkey, the howler
   monkey, have a significantly higher proportion of OR pseudogenes than do
   other New World monkeys or the lemur (a prosimian). Strikingly, the
   howler monkey is also the only New World monkey to possess full
   trichromatic vision, along with Old World monkeys and apes. Our findings
   suggest that the deterioration of the olfactory repertoire occurred
   concomitant with the acquisition of full trichromatic color vision in

Abstract = {Grandidier (1902) described a large form of Cryptoprocta ferox Bennett,
   1833, a genus of Carnivora endemic to Madagascar, from subfossil
   material dating from the presumed Holocene that he referred to the
   variety spelea. Subsequently there has been varying opinion on the
   validity of this taxon. In this paper 159 subfossil and 32 modern
   osteological specimens of Cryptoprocta are examined and analyzed to
   determine if indeed two separate forms can be morphologically
   distinguished within the sample. On the basis of these tests we conclude
   that C. spelea Grandidier, 1902 is a valid species that existed on the
   island in the recent geological past. It was presumably a formidable
   predator that may well have feed on a variety of large lemur species

Abstract = {An understanding of the fundamental causes of the structure of primate
   communities is important for studies of primate evolutionary history,
   primate behavioral ecology, and development of conservation strategies.
   Research into these structuring factors has benefited from new
   perspectives such as consideration of primate phylogenetic history,
   metacommunities, and interactions with predators and nonprimate
   competitors. This review presents the underlying factors of primate
   community structure within the biogeographic regions of Madagascar, the
   Neotropics, Africa, and Asia. One of the major differences among these
   locations likely resulted from the initial primate taxa that colonized
   each region (a single colonization event in the case of Madagascar and
   South America, and multiple radiations of higher-level taxa in Africa
   and Asia). As most primates live in forests, the differences among the
   forests in these locations, caused by various climatic influences,
   further influenced speciation and the development of primate
   communities. Within these habitats, species interactions with different
   groups of organisms were also instrumental in developing community
   dynamics. Through an investigation of these fundamental factors, we
   identify some of the most important effects on primate communities in
   each region. These findings suggest that low primate richness in Asia
   may be caused by either the abundance of dipterocarp trees or high
   levels of monsoon rains. High numbers of frugivores and a lack of
   folivores in neotropical communities may be associated with competiton
   with sloths that were already present at the time of initial radiation.
   Climatic patterns which affect forest structure and productivity in
   Madagascar may be responsible for high numbers of folivorous lemurs. The
   identification of these factors are important for the conservation of
   existing primate communities, and indicate directions for future
   studies.},

Title = {Suggestions for the functional relationship between differently located
   taste buds and vomeronasal olfaction in several mammals},
Journal = {MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {69},
Number = {5},
Pages = {311-318},
Abstract = {In almost all mammals a well developed, paired and blind ending
   vomeronasal organ (VNO) situated within the basement of the nasal
   septum, communicates with the oral cavity. This contact is established
   by two nasopalatine ducts, which penetrate the rostral palate close to
   the incisors. These ducts open orally into the sulcus which moulds the
   palatine papilla. In several mammals taste buds were found in the
   epithelium of the palatine papilla Located within the nasopalatine ducts
   or close to their oral openings. Presumably these taste buds interact
   with the vomeronasal olfaction. It is Likely that they are leading to a
   chemosensory sensation comparable to the combination of normal taste and
   smelt. As not all mammals with a functionable VNO possess taste buds in
   this position, an inspection of the rostral part of the tongue which
   touches the palatine papilla presented an interesting situation
   concerning the distribution of taste buds. This region of the tongue is
   almost completely free of taste buds in species Like Tupaia glis and
   Didelphis morsupialis virginiana, which have taste buds in the
   epithelium of their palatine papilla. In Lemur catta however, where the
   palatine papilla is tacking taste buds, the respective tongue part is
   densely covered with them. In this case it appears likely that they in a
   way of substitution functionally are connected with vomeronasal
   olfaction.},

Abstract = {A chemokine receptor from the seven-transmembrane-domain
   G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily is an essential coreceptor for
   the cellular entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HW-1) and
   simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains. To investigate nonhuman
   primate CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) homologue structure and function,
   we amplified CCR5 DNA sequences from peripheral blood cells obtained
   from 24 representative species and subspecies of the primate suborders
   Prosimii (family Lemuridae) and Anthropoidea (families Cebidae,
   Callitrichidae, Cercopithecidae, Hylobatidae, and Pongidae) by PCR with
   primers flanking the coding region of the gene. Full-length CCR5 was
   inserted into pCDNA3.1, and multiple clones were sequenced to permit
   discrimination of both alleles. Compared to the human CCR5 sequence, the
   CCR5 sequences of the Lemuridae, Cebidae, and Cercopithecidae shared
   87,91 to 92, and 96 to 99\% amino acid sequence homology, respectively.
   Amino acid substitutions tended to cluster in the amino and carboxy
   termini, the first transmembrane domain, and the second extracellular
   loop, with a pattern of species-specific changes that characterized CCR5
   homologues from primates within a given family. At variance with humans,
   all primate species examined from the suborder Anthropoidea had amino
   acid substitutions at positions 13 (N to D) and 129 (V to I); the former
   change is critical for CD4-independent binding of SIV to CCR5. Within
   the Cebidae, Cercopithecidae, and Pongidae (including humans), CCR5
   nucleotide similarities were 95.2 to 97.4, 98.0 to 99.5, and 98.3 to
   99.3\%, respectively. Despite this low genetic diversity, the phylogeny
   of the selected primate CCR5 homologue sequences agrees with present
   primate systematics, apart from some intermingling of species of the
   Cebidae and Cercopithecidae. Constructed HOS.CD4 cell lines expressing
   the entire CCR5 homologue protein from each of the Anthropoidea species
   and subspecies were tested for their ability to support HIV-1 and SIV
   entry and membrane fusion. Other than that of Cercopithecus pygerythrus,
   all CCR5 homologues tested were able to support both SIV and HIV-1
   entry. Our results suggest that the shared structure and function of
   primate CCR5 homologue proteins would not impede the movement of primate
   immunodeficiency viruses between species.},

Abstract = {Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) are dispersed repetitive DNA
   sequences that are major components of all mammalian genomes. They have
   been described in almost all lineages of Euarchontoglires (rodents,
   rabbits, primates, flying lemurs, and tree shrews), except in flying
   lemurs. Most SINE family members are composed of three distinct regions:
   a 5' tRNA-related region, a tRNA-unrelated region, and a short tandem
   repeat at the 3' end that is AT-rich. The newly discovered SINE family
   in Cynocephalus deviates from this common structure. All 30 SINE loci
   analyzed in this family lack a tRNA-unrelated region and are composed
   exclusively of tRNA-related elements. Therefore, this novel SINE
   structure, described for the first time in mammalian genomes, was
   designated as t-SINE. The t-SINE family exhibits a high copy number and
   is specific to flying lemurs. Three major t-SINE subfamilies could be
   distinguished on the basis of characteristic nucleotides, deletions,
   insertions, and duplications. These sequence-specific characteristics
   within subfamilies and sub-subfamilies reveal that they are derived
   copies of distinct progenitors. We present evolutionary relationships
   between subfamilies and compare relationships between the subfamilies
   and the isoleucine tRNA gene. t-SINE amplification occurred through
   multiple sources and is supposedly mobilized via the L1-encoded reverse
   transcriptase-dependent retrotranspositional mechanism in trans.},

Abstract = {A panel of 15 human BAC/PAC probes, covering the entire chromosome 6,
   was used in FISH experiments on great apes and on representatives of Old
   World monkeys, New World monkeys, and lemurs to delineate the chromosome
   6 phylogeny in primates. The domestic cat was used as an outgroup. The
   analysis showed a high marker order conservation, with few
   rearrangements required to reconcile the hypothesized chromosome 6
   organization in primate ancestor with marker arrangement in all the
   examined species. Contrary to this simple evolutionary scenario,
   however, the centromere was found to be located in three distinct
   regions, without any evidence of chromosomal rearrangement that would
   account for its movement. One of the two centromere repositioning events
   occurred in great apes ancestor. The centromere moved from 6p22.1 to the
   present day location after the inversion event that differentiated
   marker order of the primate ancestor from the ancestor of Catarrhini. A
   cluster of intrachromosomal segmental duplications was found at 6p22.1,
   scattered in a region of about 9 Mb, which we interpret as remains of
   duplicons that flanked the ancestral centromere. Our data, therefore,
   suggest that some duplicon clusters found in noncentromeric/nontelomeric
   locations may represent traces of evolutionary silenced centromeres that
   inactivated after the occurrence of a centromere repositioning. In
   addition, the neocentromere emergence we have documented in Old World
   monkeys at 6q24.3 appears to have arisen and progressed without
   affecting the displaced flanking sequences.},

Abstract = {Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) provide a near homoplasy
   free and copious source of molecular evolutionary markers with precisely
   defined character polarity. Used as molecular cladistic markers in
   presence/absence analyses, they represent a powerful complement to
   phylogenetic reconstructions that are based on sequence comparisons on
   the level of nucleotide substitutions. Recent sequence comparisons of
   large data sets incorporating a broad eutherian taxonomic sample have
   led to considerations of the different primate infraorders to constitute
   a paraphyletic group. Statistically significant support against the
   monophyly of primates has been obtained by clustering the flying
   lemur-also termed colugo-(Cynocephalus, Dermoptera) amidst the primates
   as the sister group to anthropoid primates (New World monkeys, Old World
   monkeys, and hominoids). We discovered retro-transposed markers that
   clearly favor the monophyly of primates, with the markers specific to
   all extant primates but definitively absent at the orthologous loci in
   the flying lemur and other non-primates. By screening the colugo genome
   for phylogenetic informative SINEs. we also recovered a novel family of
   dermopteran specific SINE elements that we call CYN. This element is
   probably derived from the isoleucine tRNA and appears in monomeric,
   dimeric, and trimeric forms. It has no long tRNA unrelated region and no
   poly(A) linker between the monomeric subunits. The characteristics of
   the novel CYN-SINE family indicate a relatively recent history.
   Therefore, this SINE family is not suitable to solve the phylogenetic
   affiliation between dermopterans and primates. Nevertheless it is a
   valuable device to reconstruct the evolutionary steps from a functional
   tRNA to an interspersed SINE element. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Title = {Effects of introduced Rattus rattus on endemic small mammals in dry

Abstract = {Studies on the effects of nonindigenous invasive species and habitat
   fragmentation on native ecosystems have become priorities for
   conservation biologists. This is relevant particularly for islands with
   high degrees of endemism. In the present paper the role of fragmentation
   and possible effects of introduced Rattus rattus on endemic rodents
   (Macrotarsomys bastardi and Eliurus spp.) and the gray mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus) were assessed for dry deciduous forests in
   Madagascar. Capture rates of endemic rodents declined significantly with
   declining fragment size. Macrotarsomys bastardi was never caught in
   primary forest fragments < 600 ha or outside the primary forest but
   captures of M. bastardi were correlated to changes in vegetation
   structure associated with fragmentation rather than to fragment size per
   se. Eliurus spp. were also found in small primary-forest fragments and
   in secondary forests close to primary forests, suggesting that secondary
   forests can serve as buffer zones or corridors for this species. The
   lemur M. murinus was caught in all types of primary and secondary
   forest. This species did not seem to respond to fragmentation of primary
   forests. Even though it was found in most secondary-forests, capture
   rates declined as these secondary forest formations increased in size.
   This indicates that secondary forests are suboptimal habitats for M.
   murinus. Rattus rattus were caught in all vegetation formations except
   for the open savanna. Their capture rates increased as forest fragments
   became smaller, indicating that mosaics of different habitat types are
   beneficial for introduced rats. There was no significant relation
   between capture rates of R. rattus and the endemic species. In
   conclusion, these results suggest that (1) native Malagasy rodents of
   the dry deciduous forest are more sensitive towards forest disturbance
   than M. murinus: (2) there is no indication for negative interactions
   between introduced rats and the native small-mammal fauna.},

Abstract = {Documenting and evaluating the appropriateness of environmental
   enrichment programs has posed a challenge to many institutions. This
   paper describes a method for documenting and evaluating activity
   patterns for developing an environmental enrichment program. A colony of
   owl (or night) monkeys (Aotus lemurinus griseimembra) at the University
   of Hawaii were videotaped using infrared sensitive cameras and the
   duration and frequency of numerous activities were scored using an
   ethological analysis software program (Hindsight). A number of activity
   patterns could be observed by using this method, and a baseline was
   established for the current environmental enrichment for this colony.
   Videotaping and computer analysis is a convenient method for documenting
   and objectively evaluating activity patterns for use in the development
   of environmental enrichment programs for captive primates and other
   species.},

Abstract = {The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) forms a critical switch in the
   production of orange/red pheomelanin and black/brown eumelanin pigments
   during hair development in mammals. The molecular evolution of the
   melanocortin-1 receptor gene was investigated in a broad range of
   primate species, including several groups with large differences in
   distribution of orange/red and black hairs. Primate MC1R has been
   subject to purifying selection throughout most of its evolution, with
   small changes in selective constraint being detected early in primate
   evolution. In contrast to the situation in humans and domestic mammals,
   many intraspecific and intrageneric differences in primate coat color
   cannot be attributed to changes in the MC1R coding sequence.
   Nevertheless, important changes in the biochemical function of MC1R are
   suggested by mutations in sites of known functional importance,
   particularly in New World monkeys and lemurs. The evolution of the MC1R
   in lion tamarins is anomalous, with a combination of a high
   nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate (dN/dS) ratio, deletions,
   and substitutions. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {A morphological study of the oblique ligament in the thumb is presented.
   The ligament was consistently described in human specimens and compared
   with dissections of non-human primates from different species. The
   oblique ligament was found in some, but not all, specimens in each of
   the following species examined: chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon, anubis
   baboon, hamadryas baboon, squirrel monkey, lemur and marmoset. A revised
   identity of the oblique ligament is proposed as a reinforced distal
   border of a fibro-osseous annular pollical flexor sheath and whose
   function is not independent of the flexor sheath. The constant presence
   and tendinous trait of the pollical oblique ligament in humans, when
   compared with non-human primates, supports the notion that the oblique
   ligament strengthens the pollical flexor sheath in humans for restraint
   of the flexor pollicis longus tendon during forceful precision pinching.
   A derivation of the pollical oblique ligament is considered as
   representing a vestigial radial limb of a flexor pollicis superficialis
   tendon in the thumb.},

Abstract = {Morphological, molecular, and biogeographic data bearing on early
   primate evolution suggest that the clade containing extant (or `crown')
   strepsirrhine primates (lemurs, lorises and galagos) arose in
   Afro-Arabia during the early Palaeogene(1), but over a century of
   palaeontological exploration on that landmass has failed to uncover any
   conclusive support for that hypothesis(2). Here we describe the first
   demonstrable crown strepsirrhines from the Afro-Arabian Palaeogene-a
   galagid and a possible lorisid from the late middle Eocene of Egypt, the
   latter of which provides the earliest fossil evidence for the
   distinctive strepsirrhine toothcomb. These discoveries approximately
   double the previous temporal range of undoubted lorisiforms and lend the
   first strong palaeontological support to the hypothesis of an ancient
   Afro-Arabian origin for crown Strepsirrhini and an Eocene divergence of
   extant lorisiform families(1,3).},

Abstract = {We performed a detailed analysis of both single-nucleotide and large
   insertion/deletion events based on large-scale comparison of 10.6 Mb of
   genomic sequence from lemur, baboon, and chimpanzee to human. Using a
   human genomic reference, optimal global alignments were constructed from
   large (>50-kb) genomic sequence clones. These alignments were examined
   for the pattern, frequency, and nature of mutational events. Whereas
   rates, of single-nucleotide substitution remain relatively constant (1-2
   x 10-(9) substitutions/site/year), rates of retrotransposition vary
   radically among different primate lineages. These differences have lead
   to a 15\%-20\% expansion of human genome size over the last 50 million
   years of primate evolution, 90\% of it due to new retroposon insertions.
   Orthologous comparisons with the chimpanzee suggest that the human
   genome continues to significantly expand due to shifts in
   retrotransposition activity. Assuming that the primate genome sequence
   we have sampled is representative, we estimate that human euchromatin
   has expanded 30 Mb and 550 Mb compared to the primate genomes of
   chimpanzee and lemur, respectively.},

Abstract = {The 320-kb human pseudoautosomal region 2 (PAR2) at the tips of the long
   arms of the X and Y chromosomes is thought to have been duplicated onto
   the Y chromosome recently in primate evolution. The four genes within
   PAR2 have been proposed to constitute two zones with different base
   ratios and transcription, one of which was added recently to the X
   chromosome. To test this hypothesis, we cloned and mapped PAR2 genes in
   other species, the lemur, the cat, and a marsupial, the tammar wallaby.
   None of the human PAR2 genes colocalized with human PAR1 genes in the
   marsupial genome, confirming that the human PARI and PAR2 evolved
   independently. Of the four PAR2 genes, only SYBL1 was located on the X
   chromosome in all species, including marsupials, so it was part of the
   ancient X. HSPRY3 localized to the X in all the eutherians, but not
   marsupial, so it must have been added to the X 80-130 million years ago.
   CXYorfl was present on the X in primates and also in mouse, but
   autosomal in wallaby, Suggesting a later addition 70-130 million years
   ago, and IL9R was on the X only in primate, suggesting addition 60-70
   million years ago. The results therefore demonstrate that at least two
   independent additions were necessary for PAR2 evolution. The present
   gene order on the human X also requires two inversions. The complicated
   evolutionary pathway supports the hypothesis that terminal
   interchromosomal rearrangements are common ill regions unpaired at
   meiosis.},

Abstract = {The calcium-dependent protease calpain is involved in numerous
   functions, including the control of cell survival, plasticity and
   motility. Whereas the isoforms calpain 1 and 2 have been described as
   ubiquitously expressed enzymes, calpain 3 has been called,
   ``muscle-specific{''}, although trace amounts of calpain 3 mRNA have
   been detected by Northern blot in brain homogenates. In this study, we
   validated antibodies raised either against the peptides that were
   specific for a given isoform or the peptides present in all the three
   isoforms. We then used the anti-calpain 3 antibodies together with
   antibodies directed against cell-type-specific proteins to determine by
   double- and triple-labelling immunocytochemistry if the protease is
   expressed in specific cell populations of rat as well as lesser mouse
   lemur (Microcebus murinus) brain. Calpain 3 was almost exclusively found
   in cells displaying astrocyte morphology. These cells, most of which
   co-expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein, were particularly numerous
   close to the striatal subventricular zone (where numerous neurones
   forming the rostral migratory stream (RMS) towards the olfactory bulbs
   are generated) and the RMS itself. Other immunoreactive cells were found
   close to the pial surface of the forebrain, in the corpus callosum and
   in the dentate gyrus. Calpain 3 may be involved in astrocyte plasticity
   and/or motility. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {L1P\_MA2 is a primate-specific subfamily of L1 retrotransposons. The
   consensus sequence of this element differs from the canonical L1
   consensus by the presence of a 3800-bp region in 5' (L1M1\_J). Part of
   this region has been proposed to be involved in a dystrophin mutation
   affecting the correct splicing of the gene and causing an X-linked
   dilated cardiomyopathy. In consideration of the potential involvement in
   splicing regulation of this element and also because of its atypical
   structure, we investigated its evolutionary history by analyzing the
   inter- and intraspecific divergence of L1P\_MA2 sequences in various
   species of primates. The resulting phylogenetic trees show long terminal
   branches and short basal internodes, as expected for a rapid event of
   diversification that occurred in the past. The phylogenetic analysis and
   the intraspecific divergence estimates revealed a pattern of evolution
   for this element similar in all primates with the exception of lemurs,
   thus suggesting that the major wave of expansion of L1P\_MA2 in primate
   genomes occurred after the divergence between Prosimiae and
   Anthropoidea. These results clearly indicate that a phylogenetic
   approach is more appropriate than methods based on sequence data from a
   single species, when investigating time and mode of evolution of
   retro-elements.},

Abstract = {The host range of most poliovirus (PV) strains is restricted to simians.
   This host range specificity is believed to be determined by the
   interaction between PV and its receptor molecule. To elucidate the
   molecular basis of this species-specific infection of PV, we cloned
   orthologs of the PV receptor (PVR) gene (pvr) as well as those of PV
   receptor-related genes 1 and 2 (prr1 and prr2) from various mammalian
   species. These three genes are widely present in mammalian genomes
   including those of non-susceptible species. Comparison of the deduced
   amino acid sequences of PVR orthologs revealed that the NH2-terminal
   immunoglobulin-like domain (domain 1), which is the virus binding site
   in the human PVR, is highly variable among species, whereas that of PRR1
   is highly conserved. Domain I of the PVR orthologs for the ring-tailed
   lemur and rabbit, which are not susceptible to PV, show only 51 and 61\%
   amino acid sequence identity to that of human PVR, respectively.
   Chimeric PVR proteins that have the domain I of the ring-tailed lemur
   and rabbit PVRs failed to serve as receptors for PV. These results
   suggest that rapid changes in the domain 1 sequence during mammalian
   evolution determined the host range restriction of PV.},

Abstract = {Non-human primates represent a valuable resource for testing potential
   vaccines candidates and drugs for human use. Malaria remains one of the
   greatest burdens for the humanity represented by approximately 500
   million new clinical cases per year worldwide and at least two million
   deaths caused annually. Additional control measures such as vaccines and
   new anti-malarial compounds are therefore urgently needed. Safety and
   protective efficacy studies in animal models are critical steps for
   vaccines and drugs development and primate models are probably the most
   appropriate for this purpose. Although Aotus genus provides several
   species susceptible to both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax,
   having different susceptibility to malaria, Aotus lemurinus griseimembra
   represents the best current malaria primate model because of its high
   susceptibility to infection by blood forms and sporozoites of both
   species of Plasmodium. Although the ultimate validation of this model
   depends upon human trials, over the past two decades these monkeys have
   proved very useful to test multiple malaria vaccine candidates prior to
   trials in humans. A good correlation between the B- and T-cell epitopes
   recognised by humans and by immunised monkeys has been documented, and
   cross reactivity between reagents for human and Aotus cytokines and
   lymphocyte markers have been identified and are facilitating the
   selection of vaccine candidates for clinical trials. Aotus also
   represents a good model for the screening of anti-malarial drugs and the
   understanding of malaria pathogenesis as well. In view of the decreasing
   availability of these primates, breeding programs and biomedical
   research facilities must be improved in countries of primate origin. (C)

Abstract = {MHC class I cDNA sequences from the most divergent primate group of
   extant primates compared to human, the suborder Strepsirrhini
   (prosimians), are described. The sequences are derived from the gray
   mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) and the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur
   catta), which are members of the malagasy Lemuriformes, as well as from
   the pygmy slow loris (Nycticebus pygmaeus), a prosimian from East Asia.
   The M. murinus sequences have been analyzed in detail. Analysis of the
   expression level, G/C content, and synonymous vs. nonsynonymous
   substitution rates in the peptide-binding region codons suggests that
   these cDNA clones represent classical class I (class la) genes.
   According to Southern blot analysis, the genome of the gray mouse lemur
   might contain about 10 class I genes. In gene tree analysis, the
   strepsirrhine class la genes described here cluster significantly
   separately from the known class I genes of Catarrhini (humans, apes, Old
   World monkeys) and Platyrrhini (New World monkeys) species, suggesting
   that the class I loci of Simiformes arose by gene duplications which
   occurred after the divergence of prosimians.},

Abstract = {Although a general agreement on the major groups of eutherian orders and
   their phylogenetic affiliations is emerging, the evolutionary
   affiliations among the members constituting these groups are still
   subject to debate. A prominent example is the recently published
   molecular evidence that challenges the long assumed monophyly of
   primates, displaying the colugo or flying lemur (Cynocephalus,
   Demloptera) as a sister to anthropoid primates (Arnason et al. 2062) and
   positioning them after the prosimian primates (tarsiers and
   strepsirbines) split off.
   The phylogenetic analysis of the complete mitochondrial (mt) genome
   sequence of Cynocephalus variegatus presented in this study first
   appears to corroborate interpretations of primates as a paraphyletic
   group. However, more detailed analyses disclosed that mt nucleotide
   composition and consequently amino acid (AA) composition varied
   considerably among the species analyzed. This led us to assume that the
   flying lemur may be incorrectly grouped with anthropoids on the basis of
   similar mt nucleotide and AA compositions, rather than reflecting the
   true evolutionary relationship.
   To reanalyze the flying lemur's evolutionary association with other
   eutherian orders from a completely different molecular perspective, a
   molecular cladistic approach was applied. To this end, we determined the
   presence/absence pattern of transposable elements that provide a nearly
   homoplasy-free and copious source of molecular evolutionary markers,
   with well-defined character polarity. We could identify transposable
   elements, both on a multilocus and single-locus level, being present in
   all extant primate infraorders but absent in the flying lemur, thus
   clearly supporting the monophyly of primates by retropositional
   evidence.},

Abstract = {For more than a century, living insectivore-like mammals have been
   viewed as little removed from the ancestral mammalian stock based on
   their retention of numerous primitive characteristics. This circumstance
   has made ``insectivores{''} a group of special interest in the study of
   mammalian evolution. Wagner (1855) included hedgehogs, moles, shrews,
   solenodons, golden moles, tenrecs, flying lemurs, tree shrews, and
   elephant shrews in Insectivora. Subsequently, morphologists excluded
   flying lemurs, tree shrews, and elephant shrews from Insectivora and
   placed these taxa in the orders Dermoptera, Scandentia, and
   Macroscelidea, respectively. The remaining insectivores constitute
   Lipotyphla, which is monophyletic based on morphology. In contrast,
   molecular data suggest that lipotyphlans are polyphyletic, with golden
   moles and tenrecs placed in their own order (Afrosoricida) in the
   superordinal group Afrotheria. Studies based on nuclear genes support
   the monophyly of the remaining lipotyphlans (= Eulipotyphla) whereas
   mitochondrial genome studies dissociate hedgehogs from moles and place
   the former as the first offshoot on the placental tree. One shortcoming
   of previous molecular studies investigating lipotyphlan relationships is
   limited taxonomic sampling. Here, we evaluate lipotyphlan relationships
   using the largest and taxonomically most diverse data set yet assembled
   for Lipotyphla. Our results provide convincing support for both
   lipotyphlan diphyly and the monophyly of Eulipotyphla. More
   surprisingly, we find strong evidence for a sister-group relationship
   between shrews and hedgehogs to the exclusion of moles. (C) 2002

Abstract = {The distribution of early life stages of cephalopods was studied during
   a cruise of the German R. ``Poseidon{''} to the Sargasso Sea in March
   1993, covering an area south-east of Bermuda from 24degreesN to
   31degreesN and 61degreesW to 65degreesW. Hydrographic measurements were
   carried out by conductivity, temperature and depth casts and/or
   expendable bathythermographs. The subtropical convergence zone was
   detected at a latitude of approximately 27degrees20'N and divided the
   Sargasso Sea into a northern and a southern area. Zooplankton sampling
   with a 6 m(2) Isaac-Kidd midwater trawl and Bongo nets yielded a total
   catch of 909 specimens of early life stages of cephalopods, representing
   at least 13 families and 20 mainly oceanic species. Multivariate
   statistical analyses were performed in order to compare the species
   composition and abundance of cephalopods. Two different assemblages were
   clearly identified, north and south of the front. According to the
   position of the front an analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) was applied,
   which confirmed the observed differences in species composition at a
   highly significant level. The Cranchiidae, mainly represented by the
   endemic species Leachia lemur, was the most abundant family, especially
   in the northern part of the Sargasso Sea, and was mainly responsible for
   the distinction between the cephalopod assemblages. In general, higher
   abundances of early life stages and a higher diversity was observed
   north of the subtropical convergence zone, which is assumed to form a
   faunal boundary.},

Abstract = {The strict orthology of mitochondrial (mt) coding sequences has promoted
   their use in phylogenetic analyses at different levels. Here we present
   the results of a mitogenomic study (i.e., analysis based on the set of
   protein-coding genes from complete mt genomes) of 60 mammalian species.
   This number includes 11 new mt genomes. The sampling comprises all but
   one of the traditional eutherian orders. The previously unrepresented
   order Dermoptera (flying lemurs) fell within Primates as the sister
   group of Anthropoidea, making Primates paraphyletic. This relationship
   was strongly supported. Lipotyphla ({''}insectivores{''}) split into
   three distinct lineages: Erinaceomorpha, Tenrecomorpha, and
   Soricomorpha. Erinaceomorpha was the basal eutherian lineage. Sirenia
   (dugong) and Macroscelidea (elephant shrew) fell within the African
   clade. Pholidota (pangolin) joined the Cetferungulata as the sister
   group of Carnivora. The analyses identified monophyletic Pinnipedia with
   Otariidae (sea lions, fur seals) and Odobenidae (walruses) as sister
   groups to the exclusion of Phocidae (true seals).},

Abstract = {In the animal kingdom the enzymes that catalyze the formation of
   alpha1,4 fucosylated-glycoconjugates are known only in apes (chimpanzee)
   and humans, They are encoded by FUT3 and FUT5 genes, two members of the
   Lewis FUT5-FUT3-FUT6 gene cluster. which had originated by duplications
   of an alpha3 ancestor gene. In order to explore more precisely the
   emergence of the alpha1,4 fucosylation, new Lewis-like
   fucosyltransferase genes were studied in species belonging to the three
   main primate groups. Two Lewis-like genes were found in brown and ruffed
   lemurs (prosimians) as well as in squirrel monkey (New World monkey). In
   the latter, one gene encodes an enzyme which transfers fucose only in
   alpha1,3 link-age, whereas the other is a pseudogene. Three genes
   homologous to chimpanzee and human Lewis genes were identified in rhesus
   macaque (Old World monkey), and only one encodes an
   alpha3/4-fucosyltransferase, The ability of new primate enzymes to
   transfer fucose in alpha1,3 or alpha13/4 linkage confirms that the amino
   acid R or W in the acceptor-binding motif ``HH(R/W)(D/E){''} is required
   for the type 1/type 2 acceptor specificity. Expression of rhesus macaque
   genes proved that fucose transfer in alpha1,4 linkage is not restricted
   to the hominoid family and may be extended to other Old World monkeys.
   Moreover, the presence of only one enzyme supporting the alpha1,4
   fucosylation in rhesus macaque versus two enzymes in hominoids suggests
   that this function occurred twice independently during primate
   evolution.},

Abstract = {I investigated sex differences in feeding ecology in a wild group of
   Hapalemur griseus, gray bamboo lemur; in southeastern Madagascar: Males
   and females differed in daily dietary diversity, height use while
   feeding, and spatial position within the group. Based on all-occurrences
   of feeding bouts and 15-min point samples, the adult female had
   significantly higher daily dietary diversity indices than those of
   males. The female also fed at significantly lower heights than. the
   males did. There are also significant differences between age classes
   with the subadult male exhibiting the lowest dietary diversity and
   feeding at the greatest heights. During feeding, the female stayed in
   closest proximity to both juveniles, whereas adult males were
   peripheral. In contrast, the males moved closer in proximity to the
   female when resting and traveling. These sex differences could be
   explained 1) by the metabolic cost of reproduction for females, 2) as
   strategies to mitigate the cost of feeding competition between males and
   females, 3) by male role performance as a predator detector, and 4) by
   different social priorities of males and females.},

   between gonadosomatic index (GI), age, and season in a wild, seasonally
   breeding lemur-the Milne-Edwards' sifaka (Propithecus diadema edwardsi).
   Between 1987 and 2000, we captured and measured male lemurs from
   Ranomafana National Park in Madagascar 69 times. We used linear and
   polynomial regressions and residuals to examine the effect of season on
   GI and the effect of age on GI, after accounting for the effect caused
   by season among males of breeding age. As the breeding season
   approached, GI increased significantly, and all individuals measured in
   both the breeding and nonbreeding season had larger GI values in the
   breeding season. Among males of breeding age, we found no relationship
   between age and GI, after accounting for seasonal effects. Age, season
   and body weight fail to explain the variation remaining in GI. We
   discuss sperm competition, breeding-group composition, and the presence
   of parents as additional sources of variation in GI.},

Abstract = {Chorionic gonadotropin (CG) is a critical signal in establishing
   pregnancy in humans and some other primates, but this placentally
   expressed hormone has not been found in other mammalian orders, The gene
   for one of its two subunit, (CG subunit {[}CGbeta]) arose by duplication
   from the luteinizing hormone P Subunit gene (LHbeta), present in all
   mammals tested. In this, study 14 primate and related mammalian species
   were examined by Southern blotting and DNA sequencing to determine where
   in mammalian phylogeny the CGbeta gene originated. Bats (order
   Chiroptera), flying lemur (order Dermoptera), strepsirrhine primates,
   and tarsiers do not ha c a CGbeta gene, although they possess one copy
   of the LHbeta gene. The CGbeta gene first arose in the common ancestor
   Of the anthropoid primates (New, World monkeys. Old World monkeys, apes,
   and humans), after the anthropoids diverged from tarsiers. At least two
   subsequent duplication events occurred in the catarrhine primates, all
   of which possess multiple CGbeta copies. The LHbeta-CGbeta family of
   genes has undergone frequent gene conversion among the catarrhines, as
   well as periods of strong positive selection in the New World monkeys
   (platyrrhines). In addition, newly generated DNA sequences from the
   promoter of the CG alpha subunit gene indicate that platyrrhine monkeys
   use a different mechanism of alpha gene expression control than that
   found in catarrhines.},

Abstract = {We sequenced the protamine P1 gene (ca. 450 bp) from 20 bats (order
   Chiroptera) and the flying lemur (order Dermoptera). We compared these
   sequences with published sequences from 19 other mammals representing
   seven orders (Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Cetacea, Perissodactyla,
   Primates, Proboscidea, and Rodentia) to assess structure, base
   compositional bias, and phylogenetic utility. Approximately 80\% of
   second codon positions were guanine, resulting in protamine proteins
   containing a high frequency of arginine residues. Our data indicate that
   codon usage for arginine differs among higher mammalian taxa. Parsimony
   analysis of 40 species representing nine orders produced a well-resolved
   tree in which most nodes were supported strongly, except at the lowest
   taxonomic levels (e.g., within Artiodactyla and Vespertilionidae). These
   data support monophyly of several taxa proposed by morphologic and
   molecular studies (all nine orders: Laurasiatheria, Cetartiodactytla,
   Yangochiroptera, Noctilionoidea, Rhinolophoidea, Vespertilionoidea,
   Phyllostomidae, Natalidae, and Vespertilionidae) and, in agreement with
   recent molecular studies, reject monophyly of Archonta, Volitantia, and
   Microchiroptera. Bats were sister to a clade containing Perissodactyla,
   Carnivora, and Cetartiodactyla, and, although not unequivocally,
   rhinolophoid bats (traditional microchiropterans) were sister to
   megachiropterans. Sequences of the protamine P1 gene are useful for
   resolving relationships at and above the familial level in bats, and
   generally within and among mammalian orders, but with some drawbacks.
   The coding and intervening sequences are small, producing few
   phylogenetically informative characters, and aligning the intron is
   difficult, even among closely related families. Given these caveats, the
   protamine P1 gene may be important to future systematic studies because
   its functional and evolutionary constraints differ from other genes
   currently used in systematic studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Abstract = {Factors influencing the transmission of Cryptosporidium in primates and
   herbivores housed at the Barcelona zoo have been analyzed. The
   relationship between continuous and discontinuous oocyst shedding, both
   animal housing conditions and abiotic factors (seasonality, humidity,
   temperature) was examined to explain the epizootiology of the protozoan.
   Thirty six fecal samples from each of 11 primates (Pongidae, Cebidae,
   Cercopithecidae and Lemuridae) and 22 herbivores (Elephantidae,
   Camelidae, Cervidae, Giraffidae and Bovidae) were examined over the
   period of 1 year. The parasite transmission was based on the chronic
   infection status of some animals serving as a source of successive
   reinfection for other animals. The environmental temperature and
   humidity (seasonality), the physical features of the facilities, the
   vicinity of the animals and the physiological status induced by
   captivity contributed to transmission. The long-term character of this
   study was essential for obtaining these results and interpreting the

Abstract = {Aotus lemurinus lemurinus monkeys were immunized four times with one of
   three DNA plasmids expressing important Plasmodium falciparum blood
   stage vaccine candidate proteins or with a mixture containing all three
   vaccines. The three vaccines encoded sequences from apical merozoite
   antigen-1 (AMA-1), erythrocyte binding protein-175 (EBA-175) and
   merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1). Antigen-specific enzyme-linked
   immunosorbant assays (ELISAs) showed no significant differences in
   antibody titer induced to the three antigens by a single vaccine
   compared with the titer induced to that same antigen by the trivalent
   preparation. Results of immunofluorescent antibody assays against
   erythrocytes infected with asexual blood stage P. falciparum indicated
   that each of the three monovalent vaccines induced significant antibody
   responses to whole parasites. The trivalent vaccine mixture induced,
   after four immunizations, an antibody titer to whole parasites that was
   3-12-fold higher than those induced by any of the single vaccines. The
   fourth immunization with the trivalent vaccine increased the mean
   antibody in IFAT by more than five-fold. Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {Molecular phylogenies challenge the view that bats belong to the
   superordinal group Archonta, which also includes primates, tree shrews,
   and flying lemurs. Some molecular studies also challenge microbat
   monophyly and instead support an alliance between megabats and
   representative rhinolophoid microbats from the families Rhinolophiclae
   (horseshoe bats, Old World leaf-nosed bats) and Megadermatidae (false
   vampire bats), Another molecular study ostensibly contradicts these
   results and supports traditional microbat monophyly, inclusive of
   representative rhinolophoids from the family Nycteridae (slit-faced
   bats). Resolution of the microbat paraphyly/monophyly issue is essential
   for reconstructing the temporal sequence and deployment of morphological
   character state changes associated with flight and echolocation in bats.
   If microbats are paraphyletic, then laryngeal echolocation either
   evolved more than once in different microbats or was lost in megabats
   after evolving in the ancestor of all living bats. To examine these
   issues, we used a 7.1-kb nuclear data set for nine outgroups and twenty
   bats, including representatives of all rhinolophold families.
   Phylogenetic analyses and statistical tests rejected both Archonta and
   microbat monophyly. Instead, bats are in the superorder Laurasiatheria
   and microbats are paraphyletic. Further, the superfamily Rhinolophoidea
   is polyphyletic. The rhinolophoid families Rhinolophiclae and
   Megadermatidae belong to the suborder Yinpterochiroptera along with
   rhinopomatids and megabats. The rhinolophoid family Nycteridae belongs
   to the suborder Yangochiroptera along with vespertilionoids,
   noctilionoids, and emballonuroids. These results resolve the apparent
   conflict between previous molecular studies that sampled different
   rhinolophoid families. An important implication of rhinolophold
   polyphyly is independent evolution of key anatomical innovations
   associated with the nasal-emission of echolocation pulses.},

Abstract = {To determine how cellular aging is conserved among primates, we analyzed
   the replicative potential and telomere shortening in skin fibroblasts of
   anthropoids and prosimians. The average telomere length of the New World
   primates Ateles geoffroyi (spider monkey) and Saimiri sciureus (squirrel
   monkey) and the Old World primates Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkey), Pongo
   pygmaeus (orangutan), and Pan paniscus (pigmy chimpanzee) ranged from 4
   to 16 kb. We found that telomere shortening limits the replicative
   capacity of anthropoid fibroblasts and that the expression of human
   telomerase produced telomere elongation and the extension of their in
   vitro life span. In contrast the prosimian Lemur catta (ring-tailed
   lemur) had both long and short telomeres and telomere shortening did not
   provide an absolute barrier to immortalization. Following a transient
   growth arrest a subset of cells showing a reduced number of chromosomes
   overgrew the cultures without activation of telomerase. Here we show
   that the presence of continuous TTAGGG repeats at telomeres and rigorous
   control of replicative aging by telomere shortening appear to be
   conserved among anthropoid primates but is less effective in prosimian
   lemurs. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science.},

Abstract = {Molecular cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding rabbit presenilin-1
   (Ps1) fragment was performed by reverse transcription polymerase chain
   reaction (RT-PCR) using primers: 5'-GGA TGA GCA GCT AAT CTA TAC C-3' and
   5'-TCC ATT CAG GGA GGT ACT TGA TA-3'. The cDNA fragment revealed 402
   nucleotides. The sequence was well conserved and found to be 91, 90, 88,
   87 and 78\% homologous to that of human, lemur, rat, mouse and chicken,
   respectively. The cDNA translated into a 130 amino-acid protein
   fragment. The deduced amino-acid sequence was also wen conserved in
   various species and exhibited 98\% similarities with those of rat, lemur
   and human homologues. However, differences were noticed at residues 145,
   168 and 212. This cDNA fragment is quite significant because it is the
   most conserved portion of Ps1 in various animals and encodes four
   transmembrane regions (TM2, 3, 4, 5) as defined in human Ps1. Moreover,
   it includes more than 50\% of the sites at which substitutions have been
   reported in familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Therefore, it is
   suggested that the rabbit can be used as an experimental model for
   future studies on Ps1 and its physiological functions to work out
   possible pathways leading to FAD linked neurodegeneration.},

Abstract = {Reasonably correct phylogenies are fundamental to the testing of
   evolutionary hypotheses. Here, we present phylogenetic findings based on
   analyses of 67 complete mammalian mitochondrial (mt) genomes. The
   analyses, irrespective of whether they were performed at the amino acid
   (aa) level or on nucleotides (nt) of first and second codon positions,
   placed Erinaceomorpha (hedgehogs and their kin) as the sister group of
   remaining eutherians. Thus, the analyses separated Erinaceomorpha from
   other traditional lipotyphlans (e.g., tenrecs, moles, and shrews),
   making traditional Lipotyphla polyphyletic. Both the aa and nt data sets
   identified the two order-rich eutherian clades, the Cetferungulata
   (comprising Pholidota, Carnivora, Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, and
   Cetacea) and the African clade (Tenrecomorpha, Macroscelidea,
   Tubulidentata, Hyracoidea, Proboscidea, and Sirenia). The study
   corroborated recent findings that have identified a sister-group
   relationship between Anthropoidea and Dermoptera (flying lemurs),
   thereby making our own order, Primates, a paraphyletic assembly.
   Molecular estimates using paleontologically well-established calibration
   points, placed the origin of most eutherian orders in Cretaceous times,
   70-100 million years before present (MYBP). The same estimates place all
   primate divergences much earlier than traditionally believed. For
   example, the divergence between Homo and Pan is estimated to have taken
   place approximate to 10 MYBP, a dating consistent with recent findings
   in primate paleontology. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

Abstract = {Eleven Microcebus murinus (lemur) primates were intracerebrally or
   orally infected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or
   macaque-adapted BSE (MBSE) brain homogenates. In many BSE and MBSE
   infected lemurs, but not in animals inoculated with normal bovine brain,
   persistent behavioral changes occurred as early as 3 months, and
   neurological signs as early as 13 months after infection.
   Immunohistochemical examination of animals sacrificed during the
   incubation period revealed an abnormal accumulation of `prion' protein
   (PrP) in the intestinal wall, intestinal nervous plexus, mesenteric
   lymph nodes and spleen, and in the clinical stage, also in the brain. In
   MBSE-inoculated animals, proteinase K resistance of the PrP (PrPres) was
   confirmed by Western blot in the spleen and the brain. Obvious signs of
   neurodegeneration were observed in all infected animals characterized by
   hyperaggregated and paired-helical filaments-immunoreactive Tau
   proteins, beta42-amyloid plaques and astrogliosis. Additionally, PrPres
   was present in the ganglion cells of the retina in diseased animals
   after either intracerebrally or oral infection by the BSE or MBSE agent.
   These results show that the microcebe is susceptible to the BSE
   infectious agent via intracerebral and oral routes with comparatively
   short incubation periods compared to simians, and could be a useful
   animal model to study the pathophysiology of disease transmission in
   primates. To cite this article: N. Bons et al., C. R. Biologies 325

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Published cladistic reconstructions of galagonid phylogeny based on
   morphological, behavioral, and genetic data have had few elements in
   common. A recent molecular study indicated that 2 of the 3 generic
   groupings derived from morphological data were not consistent with tree
   topologies constructed from the analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences.
   In this study, we compiled and analyzed a data set based on craniodental
   morphology in 13 galagonid and 8 outgroup taxa, comprising 3 dwarf-lemur
   and 5 loris species, and subjected it to cladistic analysis. Our aim was
   not only to generate a new phylogenetic hypothesis based on these data,
   but also to investigate the conditions under which congruence could be
   achieved between these results and those obtained previously. The data
   set was found to be highly sensitive to the choice of outgroup, with the
   lorises showing high interspecific variability in cranial structure.
   Congruence between the craniodental and molecular trees could be
   achieved only if Arctocebus was used as the outgroup and two characters
   were preferentially weighted. Further progress in the reconstruction of
   galagonid phylogeny will require seeking consensus in a variety of other
   data sets, including postcranial morphology, behavior, and additional
   gene sequences. The effect of different outgroups on molecular analysis
   needs attention. Am J Phys Anthropol 117:79-93, 2002. (C) 2002

Year = {2001},
Volume = {116},

Abstract = {Plesiadapiformes has long been considered to be an archaic group of
   Primates. Discovery of a paromomyid plesiadapiform skull and independent
   analysis of referred postcrania have led investigators to conclude that
   Plesiadapiformes shares a closer relationship to extant flying lemurs
   (Dermoptera) than to Primates (= Euprimates of Hoffstetter {[}1977] Bull
   Mem Soc Anthropol Paris Ser 13 4:327-346). Despite challenges to this
   interpretation, the plesiadapiform-dermopteran relationship has gained
   currency in recent years. Here we show that newly discovered crania of
   Ignacius graybullianus, preserving previously undocumented portions of
   the ear, are more similar to primates than to dermopterans. New
   specimens confirm that paromomyids lacked the petrosal bulla of
   primates. However, these new specimens also demonstrate that
   paromonryids likely had: 1) a small promontorial branch of the internal
   carotid artery; 2) a lateral route for the internal carotid nerves
   crossing the promontorium; and 3) a ring-like ectotympanic with an
   annular bridge. This pattern is similar to primitive primates and
   fundamentally different from dermopterans, which have: 1) no internal
   carotid artery; 2) internal carotid nerves that take a more medial
   route; and 3) no annular bridge. Recognition of some primate-like
   traits, documented here by new evidence, indicates that Paromomyidae is
   likely to be more closely related to other Paleogene Plesiadapiformes
   and Eocene Primates than to extant Dermoptera. In view of these
   findings, a link between paromomyids and extant dermopterans
   ({''}Eudermoptera{''}) is not convincingly supported by a single
   characteristic of the basicranium. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, hie.},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Recent analyses of nucleotide sequence data suggest that living
   placental mammals belong to one of four superorders. The early
   divergence of these groups was followed by long periods of geographical
   isolation, due to the break up of continental land masses, allowing for
   convergent evolution of similar traits in different superorders. As an
   example, the transition from epitheliochorial to haemochorial
   placentation occurred independently in bats, rodents, anthropoid
   primates, armadillos and others. A group of ancient African mammals is
   suggested by the molecular data, but is not fully supported by
   morphological evidence. The hypothesis is, however, consistent with some
   of the data on fetal membranes, suggesting that it would be worthwhile
   to study the early development of tenrecs, golden moles and elephant
   shrews. Analyses of fetal membrane traits that group the tarsiers with
   anthropoid primates, and separate them from the lemurs, are challenged
   by the molecular data. Other relatives of the primates seem to include
   tree shrews and flying lemurs, and little is known about the fetal
   membranes of the latter group. Comparative studies of placental function
   normally are confined to primates, rodents, lagomorphs and domestic
   animals: the biological diversity represented by mammals that evolved in
   ancient Africa and South America is not represented. Therefore, future
   comparative studies should strive to include species such as the rock
   hyrax and the armadillo. (C) 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.},

Abstract = {Many New World primates have high circulating levels of cortisol to
   compensate for the expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) with low
   activity. Recent work in squirrel monkeys has suggested that this may be
   due to either the expression of GRs that are transcriptionally
   incompetent or the expression of an FK506-binding immunophilin that
   inhibits GR binding. The goal of this study was to resolve this
   controversy by determining the molecular basis of glucocorticoid
   resistance not only in species of squirrel monkeys but also in other
   glucocorticoid-resistant New World primates. First, the transcriptional
   activity of the GR from the Bolivian squirrel monkey was compared to
   that of the human GR. Incubation of COS-7 cells transfected with the
   squirrel monkey GR with 10 nM dexamethasone resulted in a robust
   stimulation of MMTV-luciferase activity (up to 260-fold), which was
   similar in magnitude to that achieved with the human GR. Second, the
   effect of FK506 on GR binding was determined in cytosol from cells from
   two species of squirrel monkeys as well as glucocorticoid-resistant
   cotton-top tamarins and owl monkeys. Incubation with 10 muM FK506
   increased GR binding by at least 4-fold in cytosol from cells of each of
   the New World primates but had no effect on GR binding in cytosol from
   human WI-38 VA13 cells. Third, Western blots showed elevated expression
   of FKBP51 in New World primate cells and liver samples from two squirrel
   monkey species, On the other hand, the levels of FKBP52 were
   significantly lower in cells and liver from New World primates. The
   sequences of FKBP51 from the cotton-top tamarin, owl monkey and squirrel
   monkey are closely related and share differences from the human, rhesus
   monkey, mouse, and lemur FKBP51 sequences in the same 18 positions.
   Fourth, the relative activities of FKBP51 from the cotton-top tamarin,
   owl monkey and squirrel monkey were determined in cytosol mixing and GR
   transactivation studies and showed that FKBP51 from each of these
   primates was a potent inhibitor of GR activity. These results indicate
   that the elevated expression of FKBP51 contributes to glucocorticoid
   resistance in three New World primate genera. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {Strepsirrhines are of considerable interest for understanding the
   evolution of cone photoreceptors because they represent the most
   ancestral living primates. The retina of nocturnal Strepsirrhines is
   reported to contain a single population of medium/long wavelength
   (MW/LW) cones whereas short wavelength (SW) cones are totally absent.
   The area centralis of nocturnal Strepsirrhines also lacks the degree of
   central specialization seen in the fovea of diurnal primates. In this
   study of a nocturnal Strepsirrhine, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus
   minurinus), we used specific antibodies that recognize SW and MW/LW
   opsins to determine the presence of different cone subtypes and their
   distribution in relation to that of rods and ganglion cells. The results
   axe compared to two diurnal Haplorhine species, a New World (Callithrix
   jacchus) and an Old World (Macaca fascicularis) monkey. In the mouse
   lemur, both antibodies to MW/LW cone opsin (COS-1 and CERN956) label the
   same population of cones. A small proportion of SW cones is only stained
   by the JH455 antiserum whereas the monoclonal OS-2 antibody shows
   negative staining. These two antibodies label the same SW cone
   population in other primates, The extracellular matrix of all cones is
   also labeled by the peanut agglutinin (PNA) lectin. In mouse lemur
   retinal wholemounts, peak cone density is localized at the area
   centralis and ranged from 7,500 to 8,000 cones/mm(2). SW cones represent
   less than 0.2\% of the total cone population and are mainly located in
   the nasal part of the retina. SW cones show an irregular distribution
   and densities never exceed 49 cones/mm(2). The distribution of neurons
   in the ganglion cell layer shows a distinct centroperipheral gradient
   with a peak of 28,000 cells/mm(2) at the area centralis. Rod
   distribution shows a centroperipheral gradient with the peak (850,000
   rods/mm(2)) including and extending slightly dorsal to the area
   centralis. The theoretical spatial resolution of the mouse lemur (4.9
   cycles/degree) is slightly lower to that of other nocturnal primates.
   The densities of rods, cones, and ganglion cell layer neurons represent
   a compromise between spatial resolution and sensitivity for both
   photopic and scotopic vision. J. Comp. Neurol. 438: 490-504,2001. (C)

Abstract = {M6P/IGF2R imprinting first appeared approximately 150 million years ago
   following the divergence of prototherian from therian mammals. Although
   M6P/IGF2R is clearly imprinted in opossums and rodents, its imprint
   status in humans remains ambiguous. It is also still unknown if
   M6P/IGF2R imprinting was an ancestral mammalian epigenotype or if it
   evolved convergently. We report herein that M6P/IGF2R is imprinted in
   Artiodactyla, as it is in Rodentia and Marsupialia, but that it is not
   imprinted in Scandentia, Dermoptera and Primates, including ringtail
   lemurs and humans. These results are most parsimonious with a single
   ancestral origin of M6P/IGF2R imprinting followed by a lineage-specific
   disappearance of M6P/IGF2R imprinting in Euarchonta. The absence of
   M6P/IGF2R imprinting in extant primates, due to its disappearance from
   the primate lineage over 75 million years ago, demonstrates that
   imprinting at this locus does not predispose to human disease. Moreover,
   the divergent evolution of M6P/IGF2R imprinting predicts that the
   success of in vitro embryo procedures such as cloning may be species
   dependent.},

Abstract = {A nearly complete skull of Parapithecus grangeri from the early
   Oligocene of Egypt is described. The specimen is relatively undistorted
   and is undoubtedly the most complete higher primate skull yet found in
   the African Oligocene, which also makes it the most complete Oligocene
   primate cranium worldwide. Belonging in superfamily Parapithecoidea, a
   group regarded by some as the sister group to all other Anthropoidea,
   this skull reveals important information about the radiation of stem
   anthropoideans. This cranium is about 15\% larger than size estimates
   based on a fragmentary cranium of its contemporary and close relative
   Apidium phiomense. It is about the same size as that of the gray gentle
   lemur, Hapalemur griseus, or of platyrrhines such as the owl mon key,
   Aotus trivirgatus, or the titi mon key, Callicebus torquatus,
   Comparatively small orbits and size differences in jaws and teeth show
   it was both diurnal and dimorphic. This is the only specimen of the
   species that shows (from sockets) that there were four small upper
   incisors. Several mandibular specimens of the species establish that
   there were no permanent lower incisors and that the symphysis was fused.
   Like other early anthropoideans this species possessed a lower
   encephalization quotient and less-developed orbital frontality than
   later anthropoideans, There is full postorbital closure and fusion of
   the metopic suture, and the ectotympanic forms a rim to the auditory
   aperture. A probable frontal/alisphenoid contact is a potentially
   derived resemblance to Catarrhini. A proposed separate genus for the
   species P, grangeri is not sustained.},

Abstract = {The three living monophyletic divisions of Class Mammalia are the
   Prototheria (monotremes), Metatheria (marsupials), and Eutheria
   ('placental' mammals). Determining the sister relationships among these
   three groups is the most fundamental question in mammalian evolution.
   Phylogenetic comparison of these mammals by either anatomy or
   mitochondrial DNA has resulted in two conflicting hypotheses, Theria and
   Marsupionta, and has fueled a ``genes versus morphology{''} controversy.
   We have cloned and analyzed a large nuclear gene, the mannose
   6-phosphate/ insulin-like growth factor II receptor (M6P/IGF2R), from
   representatives of all three mammalian groups, including platypus,
   echidna, opossum, wallaby, hedgehog, mouse, rat, rabbit, cow, pig, bat,
   tree shrew, colugo, ringtail lemur, and human. Statistical analysis of
   this nuclear gene unambiguously supports the morphology-based Theria
   hypothesis that excludes monotremes from a clade of marsupials and
   eutherians. The M6P/IGF2R was also able to resolve the finer structure
   of the eutherian mammalian family tree. In particular, our analyses
   support sister group relationships between lagomorphs: and rodents, and
   between the primates and Dermoptera. Statistical support for the
   grouping of the hedgehog with Feruungulata and Chiroptera was also
   strong.},

Abstract = {The gene encoding brain-specific dendritic BC200 small non-messenger RNA
   is limited to the primate order and arose from a monomeric Alu element.
   It is present and neuronally expressed in all Anthropoiden examined. By
   comparing the human sequence of about 13.2 kb with each of the prosimian
   (lemur 14.6 kb, galago 12 kb, and tarsier 13.8 kb) orthologous loci, we
   could establish that the BC200 RNA gene is absent from the prosimian
   lineages. In Strepsirhini (lemurs and lorises), a dimeric AluJ-like
   element integrated Very close to the BC; while the corresponding tarsier
   region is devoid of any repetitive element. Consequently, insertion of
   the Alu monomer that gave rise to the BC200 RNA gene must have occurred
   after the anthropoid lineage diverged from the prosimian lineage(s).
   Shared insertions of other repetitive elements favor proximity of
   simians and tarsiers in support of their grouping into Haplorhini and
   the omomyid hypothesis. On the other hand, the nucleotide sequences in
   the segment that is available for comparison in all four species reveal
   less exchanges between Strepsirhini (lemur and galago) and human than
   between tarsier and human. Our data imply that the early activity of
   dimeric Alu sequences must have been concurrent with the activity of
   monomeric Alu elements that persisted longer than is usually thought. As
   BC200 RNA gave rise to more than 200 pseudogenes, we used their
   consensus sequence variations as a molecular archive recording the BC200
   RNA sequence changes in the anthropoid lineage leading to Homo sapiens
   and timed these alterations over the past 35-55 million years. (C) 2001

   concentrations of Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn and Cd ranged 4.00-7.28, 2.35-7.72,
   0.20-0.45, 0.20-0.83 and <0.0005 <mu>g/g wet weight, respectively. The
   liver concentrations of the five elements were in the range of
   23.0-66.6, 131-646, 3.34-48.2, 0.75-1.94, and 0.08-0.70 mug/g wet
   weight, respectively. A significant species-specific difference mas
   found. The Sardinella lemuru contained higher muscle concentrations of
   Zn, Mn and Cd than the other species of fishes. However, the Liza
   macrolepis contained the highest liver concentrations of Fe and Cu. Thr
   metal concentrations found in this study were similar to the metal
   levels of the fishes collected from slightly polluted waters all over
   the world and Taiwan. Therefore, no public health problem would be
   raised in the consumption of the fishes.},

Abstract = {Three pastures used for moufflons (Ovis musimon) and fallow deer (Cervus
   dama) situated at an altitude of 500-900 m in the Rhodope Mountains,
   Bulgaria, were examined to determine the range of the intermediate hosts
   of Gongylonema pulchrum. In total, 309 beetles of 15 species of the
   family Scarabeidae were studied. Infection was found in 8 species:
   Sisyphus schaetteri, Caccobius schreberi, Onthophagus amyntas, O.
   tracticornis, O. lemur, O. ruticapillus, O. similis (new host record)
   and O. verticicornis. The highest prevalences were recorded in C.
   schreberi (40.0 \%), S. schaetteri (28.6 \%), O. verticicornis (26.1 \%)
   and O. ruticapillus (22.8 \%). Comparison with previous studies showed
   that almost all the species recorded in the game animal pastures had
   been reported as intermediate hosts in the lowland pastures where
   domesticated animals serve as final hosts. The main differences are the
   smaller number of scarabeid species occurring in the pastures in game
   farms and the lack of the Aphodiinae acting as intermediate hosts.},

Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Comparison of mammalian brain parts has often focused on differences in
   absolute size(1-3), revealing only a general tendency for all parts to
   grow together(2). Attempts to find size-independent effects using body
   weight as a reference variable(1) obscure size relationships owing to
   independent variation of body size(4) and give phylogenies of
   questionable significance(5). Here we use the brain itself as a size
   reference to define the cerebrotype, a species-by-species measure of
   brain composition. With this measure, across many mammalian taxa the
   cerebellum occupies a constant fraction of the total brain volume (0.13
   +/- 0.02), arguing against the hypothesis that the cerebellum acts as a
   computational engine principally serving the neocortex(3). Mammalian
   taxa can be well separated by cerebrotype, thus allowing the use of
   quantitative neuroanatomical data to test evolutionary relationships.
   Primate cerebrotypes have progressively shifted and neocortical volume
   fractions have become successively larger in lemurs and lorises, New
   World monkeys, Old World monkeys, and hominoids, lending support to the
   idea that primate brain architecture has been driven by directed
   selection pressure(4). At the same time, absolute brain size can vary
   over 100-fold within a taxon, while maintaining a relatively uniform
   cerebrotype. Brains therefore constitute a scalable architecture.},

Abstract = {This study presents evidence that the first primates share with extant
   lemurs, tarsiers, and anthropoids hand proportions unlike those of their
   close relatives, the tree shrews (Scandentia), colugos (Dermoptera), and
   plesiadapiforms. Specifically, early primates as well as modem
   strepsirhines and haplorhines have relatively short metacarpals and long
   proximal phalanges giving them a grasping, prehensile hand. Limb
   development was studied in the primate Microcebus murinus and a
   comparative sample of rodents, artiodactyls, and marsupials to
   investigate the role of embryonic patterning in the morphogenesis and
   evolution of primate hand proportions. Comparative analysis shows that
   the derived finger proportions of primates are generated during the
   early phases of digital ray patterning and segmentation, when the
   interzone cells marking the presumptive metacarpo- and interphalangeal
   joints first appear. Interspecific variation in relative digit and
   metapodial proportions therefore has high developmental penetrance; that
   is, adult differences are observed at early ontogenetic stages. The
   paleontological, comparative, and developmental data are therefore
   consistent with the hypothesis that the early Cenozoic origin of
   primates involved an evolutionary change in digital ray pattern
   formation ultimately yielding a grasping, prehensile hand. (C) 2001

Abstract = {Evolutionary centromere repositioning is a paradox we have recently

   conservative hypothesis assuming sequential pericentric inversions, and
   a more challenging assumption involving centromere emergence during
   evolution. The complex evolutionary history showed by chromosome IX did
   not allow us to clearly distinguish between these two hypotheses. Here
   we report comparative studies of chromosome X in two lemur species: the
   black lemur and the ringtailed lemur. The X chromosome is telocentric in
   the black lemur and almost metacentric in the ringtailed lemur. The
   marker order along these chromosomes, however, was found to be perfectly
   colinear with humans. Our data unequivocally point to centromere
   emergence as the most likely explanation of centromere repositioning.},

Abstract = {A review is presented of the birds, lipotyphlans, rodents and lemurs
   occurring across an elevational transect from 720 to 2450 m within the
   31 160 ha Parc National (PN) d'Andringitra in south-central Madagascar.
   The broad range of habitats within this reserve consists of lowland
   forest, montane forest, sclerophyllous forest, montane thicket, to open
   areas of bare rocks covered by geophytes. Eight different zones were
   surveyed across this elevational range for most of these four vertebrate
   orders.
   On the basis of these surveys and other sources of information, 106
   species of birds, 16 species of Lipotyphla, 11 species of rodents
   (including two introduced species) and 13 species of primates are
   documented within the reserve. Surveys of the carnivores are incomplete,
   although eight species, three of which are introduced, have been
   recorded in the reserve. Forty-eight species of non-volant mammals are
   known from the Andringitra Massif, 43 of which are endemic to
   Madagascar.
   The highest species richness for birds was 85 species in the disturbed
   lowland forest at 720 m zone and there was a subsequent reduction in the
   number of species at each site with increasing elevation. The two zones
   at 1210 and 1625 m with montane and mixed montane/sclerophyllous forest
   had the greatest species richness of non-volant mammals with 26 species
   (25 non-introduced). Lemurs showed decreasing species richness with
   increasing elevation. Small mammals showed broad elevational ranges and
   high species diversity in the middle to upper portion of the forest
   zone, with lipotyphlans peaking at 1990 m and rodents between 1625 and
   1960 m.
   About 88 species of extant native rodents, carnivores, lipotyphlans and
   primates are currently recognized to occur on Madagascar. Thus, the PN
   d'Andringitra holds nearly 50\% of the total known fauna of these groups
   from the island. This relatively small reserve plays a major role in
   safe-guarding a large proportion of the non-volant mammal fauna of
   Madagascar.},

Abstract = {The precise hierarchy of ancient divergence events that led to the

Abstract = {Molecular phylogeneticists must frequently decide on a painful trade-off
   between the number of taxa and (tic number of sequences used in a study.
   Here, we illustrate the advantages of a method of combining quartet
   trees to solve this dilemma. We apply the method to a data set of 640
   protein-sequence alignments from 4 to 24 eutherian taxa, and obtain a
   global eutherian phylogeny. In agreement with recent studies, we
   identify three major super-ordinal clades. The first clade is
   Afrotheria, a cluster of endemic African mammals. The second clade is an
   emended Laurasiatheria, consisting of Cetartiodactyla (cetaceans,
   ruminants, hippopotamuses, pigs, and tylopods), Perissodactyla (horses
   and rhinoceroses), Carnivora, Pholidota (pangolins), Chiroptera (bats),
   and Erinaceidae (hedgehogs). A tentatively identified third clade
   consists of some archontans (primates, flying lemurs, and tree shrews)
   as well as lagomorphs and rodents. Evolutionary relations within these
   major clades are well resolved. We also show that nuclear encoded
   proteins resolve eutherian phylogeny better than complete mitochondria.
   Finally, our results demonstrate that combining quartet trees provides a
   major opportunity to resolve unevenly sampled complex phylogenies.},

Abstract = {This study examines behavioral affective reactions elicited by tastes
   from eight newborn human infants, and from 27 other infant or adult
   primates. Non-human primates belonged to 11 species: three great apes
   (chimpanzee, orangutan, gorilla), three Old World monkeys (rhesus
   monkey, greater spot-nosed monkey, and red-capped mangabey), four New
   World monkeys (golden-handed tamarin, cotton-top tamarin, white
   tufted-ear marmoset, and Humboldt's night monkey), and one lemur
   (mongoose lemur). The taste of sucrose elicited homologous positive
   hedonic patterns of facial affective reactions from humans and other
   primates, whereas quinine elicited homologous aversive or negative
   affective patterns. The degree of similarity between human and other
   primate affective reaction patterns appeared to be strongly indicative
   of their phylogenetic relatedness. For example, affective reaction
   patterns of human infants and great apes were more similar to each other
   than either were to Old World monkeys or New World monkeys. Certain
   affective reaction components were found to be shared by humans and all
   primates, whereas other components were restricted to particular
   taxonomic groups. Finally, allometric timing parameters for the:
   duration of components: indicated that the `same' affective reaction
   could have different durations in species of different size. These
   results show that both positive/negative valence and intensity of
   affective reaction may be quantitatively assessed in human and non-human
   primates, and indicate that taste-elicited affective reaction patterns
   of human infants are related systematically to those of other primate
   species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Chromosomal localization of 18S rDNA and telomere sequence was attempted
   on the chromosomes of the aye-aye (2n = 30) using fluorescence in situ
   hybridization (FISH) and primed in situ labeling (PRINS), respectively.
   The rDNA was localized at the tip or whole of the short arm of
   acrocentric chromosomes 13 and 14 in all spreads observed. However,
   post-FISH silver-nitrate (Ag) staining showed that transcriptional
   activity of the rRNA genes was variable, particularly in chromosome 14,
   which was most frequently negative in one homologue carrying the smaller
   copy number of rDNA. This observation supports, at the molecular
   cytogenetic level, previous data concerning the relationship between the
   copy number of rDNA and its trancriptional activity. On the other hand,
   telomere sequence was localized only at the telomeric region of all
   chromosomes, the so-called telomere-only pattern, a characteristic
   similar to that of the greater bushbaby. These data may provide
   information on the chromosomal evolution of the lemur, because locations
   of rDNA and telomere sequences frequently offer important clues in
   reconstruction of karyotype differentiation.},

Title = {The human vomeronasal organ. Part II: prenatal development},

Volume = {197},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {During the 20th century, the human vomeronasal organ (VNO) has been
   controversial regarding its structure, function, and even identity.
   Despite reports that provide evidence for its presence throughout
   prenatal and postnatal ontogeny, some studies and numerous textbooks
   declare its absence in late fetal and postnatal humans. To that end, the
   present study was designed to establish firmly whether the human VNO is
   homologous with that or other mammals and whether it degenerates
   (partially or completely) or persists throughout prenatal development.
   Fifty human embryos and fetuses (33 d to 32 wk fertilisation age) and 2
   neonates were examined by light microscopy. Four embryonic primates
   (mouse lemurs) were examined for a comparison of VNO embryogenesis. The
   presence or absence and structural characteristics of the VNO and
   supporting tissues are described. The first appearance of the VNO was in
   the form of bilateral epithelial thickenings of the nasal septum, the
   vomeronasal primordium. The primordia invaginated between 37 and 43 d of
   age and formed the tubular VNO. The tubular VNO was located dorsally at
   a variable distance from, but was always spatially separated from the
   paraseptal cartilages. The mouse lemurs examined in this study and other
   reports from the literature indicate that the human VNO resembles that
   of primates having functional VNOs until just after a tubular VNO is
   formed. Examination of the VNO and adjacent tissues suggested that the
   VNO may lose receptor cells and corresponding vomeronasal nerves and
   become a ciliated, pseudostratified epithelium between similar to 12 and
   14 wk of age. Our findings indicate the prenatal human VNO goes through
   3 successive stages: early morphogenesis, transformation (of the
   epithelium), and growth. These observations indicated that (1) all
   embryonic humans develop a vomeronasal organ which is homologous with
   the VNOs of other mammals, but which has become displaced and highly
   variable in relative location during embryogenesis; (2) the human
   vomeronasal organ does not degenerate prenatally, but very likely loses
   the functional components of the vomeronasal complex of other mammals;
   and (3) the remnant of the human VNO persists until birth and beyond.},

Abstract = {We evaluated repeated blood-stage infections with Plasmodium falciparum
   in eight Aotus lemurinus lemurinus monkeys. Over the course of seven
   infections with 10(4) P. falciparum (the Vietnam Oak Knell {[}FVO]
   strain), the pre-patent period lengthened from 8.2 to 30.8 days; the
   peak parasitemia decreased from 4.5 x 10(5) to 0 parasites/mul
   (Challenges 6 and 7), and the requirement for treatment decreased from
   100\% to 0\% (Challenges 3 to 7). Five weeks after the seventh FVO
   challenge, the eight immune and three naive monkeys received 10(4)
   parasitized erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum (CAMP strain). The
   three control animals experienced uncontrolled parasitemias reaching
   between 4.8 and 7.7 x 10(5) parasites/mul (pre-patency = 6.3 days) and
   all required drug treatment; six of the eight immune monkeys became
   parasitemic (pre-patency = 8.8 days), but self-cured. Two of three of
   the monkeys having the greatest reductions in hematocrit (50-60\%) also
   had the highest parasitemias (similar to 10(4) parasites/mul) before
   self-curing. Repeated homologous infections induced sterile immunity to
   homologous challenge; during heterologous challenge the monkeys
   developed clinically relevant, but not life-threatening, parasitemias
   and anemia.},

Abstract = {Olfactory receptors (ORs) located in the cell membrane of olfactory
   sensory neurons of the nasal epithelium are responsible for odor
   detection by binding specific odorant ligands. Primates are thought to
   have a reduced sense of smell (microsmatic) with respect to other
   mammals such as dogs or rodents. We have previously demonstrated that
   over 70\% of the human OR genes have become nonfunctional pseudogenes,
   leading us to hypothesize that the reduced sense of smell could
   correlate with the loss of functional genes. To extend these results, we
   sampled the OR gene repertoire of 10 primate species, from prosimian
   lemur to human, in addition to mouse. About 221 previously unidentified
   primate sequences and 33 mouse sequences were analyzed. These sequences
   encode ORs distributed in seven families and 56 subfamilies. Analysis
   showed a high fraction (approximate to 50\% on average) of pseudogenes
   in hominoids, In contrast, only approximate to 27\% of OR genes are
   pseudogenes in Old World monkeys, and New World monkeys are almost free
   of pseudogenes, The prosimian branch seems to have evolved differently
   from the other primates and has approximate to 37\% pseudogene content.
   No pseudogenes were found in mouse. With the exception of New World
   monkeys, we demonstrate that primates have a high fraction of OR
   pseudogenes compared with mouse. We hypothesize that under relaxed
   selective constraints, primates would have progressively accumulated
   pseudogenes with the highest level seen in hominoids, The fraction of
   pseudogenes in the OR gene repertoire could parallel the evolution of
   the olfactory sensory function.},

Abstract = {Dental calculus and associated periodontal disease are serious clinical
   problems in captive squirrel monkeys. Calculus begins to appear as early
   as 2 years of age, with subsequent development of periodontal disease,
   dental abscessation, tooth loss and other sequelae, When used as a feed
   additive, sodium hexametaphosphate (HMP) retards the growth of calculus
   on previously cleaned teeth in rhesus monkeys, lemurs, and other
   species. We wanted to determine whether HMP would reduce dental calculus
   in squirrel monkeys (Saimiri spp,) whose teeth had not been pre-cleaned.
   The study animals were divided into two groups. One received a standard
   diet; the other received an identical diet containing the HMP additive
   at a concentration effective in other primate and non-primate species
   that had received dental cleaning prior to treatment with HMP, Teeth
   were graded for extent of calculus formation at the start of the study
   and at 3 and 6 months during HMP treatment. We compared the results from
   the two groups both by total score per animal and according to tooth
   type (e.g., incisors versus incisors in test and control groups), At the
   end of 6 months, dental calculus did not differ significantly between
   the experimental groups, Therefore, we conclude that HMP is ineffective
   in squirrel monkeys with preexisting dental calculus.},

Abstract = {Six microsatellite - or short tandem repeat (STR) - systems with uniform
   repetitive sequences (HumTH01, HumCD4, HumFES/FPS, HumF13B, HumTPO,
   HumLPL) and three compound repeat systems (HumVWA, HumFIBRA, D21S11)
   were used, including data from the literature, to determine genetic
   distances among eight populations worldwide. The TH01- and VWA
   homologous loci in nonhuman primates (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans,
   rhesus monkeys, ring-tailed lemurs) were compared and found to be
   shorter than in humans. Microsatellites of lower complexity were most
   efficient for the separation of major ethnic groups. The loci of higher
   complexity showed a leveling of the diversity differences among
   populations, which could be attributed to higher mutation rates.},

Abstract = {Paleontological and molecular evidence have been employed to suggest
   that flying lemurs (Dermoptera) and primates form a monophyletic group,
   in sharp contrast with cranial and postcranial evidence indicating
   sister group relationships between flying lemurs and bats (Chiroptera).
   New evidence from the epidermis of the volar pads of primates, tree
   shrews, flying lemurs, bats, and other mammals was examined and mapped
   on to various hypotheses of archontan relationships. The micro-anatomy
   of the skin on the palm and sole of flying lemurs and bats differs
   fundamentally from that of tree shrews (Scandentia) and primates. The
   volar skin of flying lemurs and bats lacks the serial arrangement of
   papillary ridges and grooves ({''}fingerprints{''}) found in primates,
   tree shrews, and many other mammals. Moreover, the junction between the
   epidermis and dermis in flying lemurs and bats is relatively flat and
   shows little or no development of the internal ridges that occur in
   primates and tree shrews. When mapped on to a set of cladograms of
   mammals currently allocated to the superorder Archonta, this new
   evidence does not support sister group relationships between flying
   lemurs and primates, regardless of the volar skin morphology that
   characterized the last common ancestor of Archonta. Micro-anatomical
   differences that distinguish the volar skin of flying lemurs and bats
   from that of primates and tree shrews reflect a profound dichotomy in
   the functional roles fulfilled by the extremities, which could be
   significant in a phylogenetic context. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {Bats (order Chiroptera) are one of the few orders of mammals that
   echolocate and the only group with the capacity for powered flight. The
   order is subdivided into Microchiroptera and Megachiroptera, with an
   array of characteristics defining each group(1), including complex
   laryngeal echolocation systems in microbats and enhanced visual acuity
   in megabats. The respective monophylies of the two suborders have been
   tacitly assumed, although microbat monophyly is uncorroborated by
   molecular data, Here we present a phylogenetic analysis of bat
   relationships using DNA sequence data from four nuclear genes and three
   mitochondrial genes (total of 8,230 base pairs), indicating that
   microbat families in the superfamily Rhinolophoidea are more closely
   related to megabats than they are to other microbats, This implies that
   echolocation systems either evolved independently in rhinolophoids and
   other microbats or were lost in the evolution of megabats, Our data also
   reject flying lemur (order Dermoptera) as the bat sister group,
   indicating that presumed shared derived characters for flying lemurs and
   bats(2) are convergent features that evolved in association with gliding
   and flight, respectively.},

Abstract = {By amplification and sequencing of RH gene intron 4 of various primates
   we demonstrate that an Alu-Sx-like element has been inserted in the RH
   gene of the common ancestor of humans, apes, Old World monkeys, and New
   World monkeys. The study of mouse and lemur intron 4 sequences allowed
   us to precisely define the insertion point of the Alu-Sx element in
   intron 4 of the RH gene ancestor common to Anthropoidea. Like humans,
   chimpanzees and gorillas possess two types of RH intron 4, characterized
   by the presence (human RHCE and ape RHCE-like genes) or absence (human
   RHD and ape RHD-like genes) of the Alu-Sx element. This led us to
   conclude that in the RH common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, and
   gorillas, a duplication of the common ancestor gene gave rise to two
   genes, one differing from the other by a 654-bp deletion encompassing an
   Alu-Sx element. Moreover, most of chimpanzees and some gorillas possess
   two types of RHD-like intron 4. The introns 4 of type 1 have a length
   similar to that of human RHD intron 4, whereas introns 4 of type 2
   display an insertion of 12 bp. The latest insertion was not found in the
   human genome (72 individuals tested). The study of RH intron 3 length
   polymorphism confirmed that, Like humans, chimpanzees and gorillas
   possess two types of intron 3, with the RHD-type intron 3 being 289
   bases shorter than the RHCE intron 3. By amplification and sequencing of
   regions encompassing introns 3 and 4, we demonstrated that chimpanzee
   and gorilla RH-like genes displayed associations of introns 3 and 4
   distinct to those found in man. Altogether, the results demonstrate
   that, as in humans, chimpanzee and gorilla RH genes experienced
   intergenic exchanges.},

Abstract = {Two areas of tannin-related research will be discussed: 1)
   interrelationships, assessed by comparing 16S rDNA sequences, among
   tannin-tolerant bacteria (TTB) isolated from different animal species
   and locations; and 2) methods to assess the biological activity of
   tannins that do not rely on precipitation as an end-point. The ability
   of gastrointestinal microbes to tolerate and detoxify tannins may
   explain why some animals can tolerate much higher dietary levels of
   proanthocyanidins than others. To determine how TTB from different
   species and locations are related, faecal, crop or ruminal samples were
   obtained from the following locations and species: Venezuelan hoatzin
   (Opisthocomus hoazin), Ugandan mountain gorilla (Gorilla gorilla
   berengei), Malagasy red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer), New York
   white-tail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus
   elaphus nelsoni) from Oregon, Sardinian sheep (Ovis aries), Colombian
   and Honduran goats (Capra hircus) and non-lactating New York cows (Bos
   taurus). Bacteria able to tolerate at least 0.2\% (w/v) of tannic acid
   or 0.1\% (w/v) purified quebracho were isolated from all samples except
   from those from cows at Cornell University. Closely related members of
   the Streptococcus genus were isolated from gorilla and lemur faeces as
   well as from ruminal samples of elk, white-tail deer, goats and sheep.
   In addition, TTB representing Enterobacteriaceae, and taxon subcluster
   XIVa were isolated. Tannin tolerance is not limited by either species or
   geographical barriers. Failure to isolate TTB from Cows fed grass hay
   suggests that diet affects the presence of TTB. The authors have
   developed a new colorimetric assay for tannin biological activity based
   on tannin inhibition of the lysozyme-catalysed hydrolysis of
   dye-labelled Micrococcus luteus cells.},

Abstract = {A manned Mars habitat will require a significant amount of
   infrastructure that can be deployed using robotic precursor missions.
   This infrastructure deployment will probably include the use of
   multiple, heterogeneous, mobile robotic platforms. Delays due to the
   long communication path to Mars limit the amount of teleoperation that
   is possible. A control architecture called CAMPOUT (Control Architecture
   for Multirobot Planetary Outposts) is currently under development at the
   Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, CA. It is a three layer behavior-based
   system that incorporates the low level control routines currently used
   on the JPL SRR/FIDO/LEMUR revers. The middle behavior layer uses either
   the BISMARC (Biologically Inspired System for Map based Autonomous Rover
   Control) or MOBC (Multi-Objective Behavior Control) action selection
   mechanisms. CAMPOUT includes the necessary group behaviors and
   communication mechanisms for coordinated/cooperative control of
   heterogeneous robotic platforms. We report the results of some ongoing
   work at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, CA on the transport phase of
   a photovoltaic (PV) tent deployment mission.},

Abstract = {Coordination of primate group movements by individual group members is
   generally categorized as leadership behavior, which entails several
   steps: deciding where to move next, initiating travel, and leading a
   group between food, water sources, and rest sites. Presumably, leaders
   are able to influence their daily foraging efficiency and nutritional
   intake, which could influence an individual's feeding ecology and
   long-term reproductive success. Within anthropoid species, females lead
   group movements in most female-bonded groups, while males lead groups in
   most nonfemale-bonded groups. Group leadership has not been described
   for social prosimians, which are typically non female-bonded We describe
   group movements in two nonfemale-bonded, lemurid species living in
   southeastern Madagascar, Propithecus diadema edwardsi and Eulemur fulvus
   rufus. Although several social lemurids exhibit female dominance,
   Eulemur fulvus rufus does not, and evidence for female dominance is
   equivocal in Propithecus diadema edwardsi. Given the ecological stresses
   that females face during reproduction, we predict that females in these
   two species will implement alternative behavioral strategies such as
   group leadership in conjunction with, or in the absence of, dominance
   interactions to improve access to food. We found that females in both
   species initiated and led group movements significantly more often than
   males did. In groups with multiple females, one female was primarily
   responsible for initiating and leading group movements. We conclude that
   female nutritional needs may determine ranging behavior to a large
   extent in these prosimian species, at least during months of gestation
   and lactation.},

Abstract = {In fragmented landscapes, linear forest remnants have the potential to
   provide habitat and movement corridors for wildlife. We used systematic
   spotlighting surveys to sample arboreal mammals in 36 linear rainforest
   remnants in tropical Queensland, Australia. The effects of corridor
   width, height, isolation, elevation, and floristic composition on
   mammals were assessed with multiple regression models. Six species were
   recorded during 108 surveys. The most vulnerable species, the lemuroid
   ringtail possum (Hemibelideus lemuroides), was found only in remnants
   comprised of primary rainforest that were linked to large tracts of
   continuous forest. Two other species, the Herbert River ringtail possum
   (Pseudochirulus herbertensis) and striped possum (Dactylopsila
   trivirgata), also favored corridors that were linked to forest tracts or
   fragments, with the former favoring high-diversity forest (primary
   forest or mixed regrowth) over low-diversity (Acacia) regrowth. Three
   other species, the coppery brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula),
   green ringtail possum (Pseudochirops archeri), and Lumholtz's
   tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus lumholtzi), occurred in both isolated and
   non-isolated remnants and both primary forest and regrowth th. Our
   findings suggest that linear forest remnants that are floristically
   diverse (not Acacia-dominated regrowth) and at least 30-40 m width can
   function as habitat and probably movement corridors for most arboreal
   mammals in this region. The lemuroid ringtail, however, apparently.
   requires corridors of primary rainforest of at least 200 m in width.
   Because the lemuroid ringtail is highly vulnerable to forest
   fragmentation, faunal corridors in this region should be designed
   wherever possible to meet its ecological requirements. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Title = {Feeding ecology of the hibernating primate Cheirogaleus medius: how does

Abstract = {The fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius; Cheirogaleidae) lives
   in the tropical forests of Madagascar. It is exceptional among primates,
   because this small nocturnal lemur hibernates during the dry season from
   the end of April until October. This field study was carried out to
   assess seasonal changes in body mass and behavioral traits (locomotor
   activity, feeding ecology) of C. medius that enable this species to
   accumulate large quantities of fat within weeks. Feeding observations of
   36 radio-collared individuals were combined with a mark-recapture study
   in western Madagascar during the rainy seasons from 1995 to 1998. Pulp
   of fruit species not consumed, as well as fruit species eaten by C.
   medius was analyzed for lipid and sugar contents. Body mass changes of
   recaptured individuals revealed that C. medius may double its body mass
   within a few weeks. Most of the increase in body mass took place between
   March and April after infants had been weaned and directly before the
   onset of hibernation. Locomotor activity was significantly reduced
   during the period of body mass gain. During the entire study, fruits,
   nectar, and flowers of 34 different plant species comprised about 80\%
   of the diet, supplemented by a. seasonally varying intake of animal
   prey. Lipid contents of consumed fruits were comparatively low
   throughout the study period. No difference in lipid content was
   detectable between fruit species consumed and not consumed by C. medius.
   During prehibernation fattening, C. medius consumed mostly fruit species
   with a high sugar content, significantly higher than that of fruit
   species that were not consumed. The results suggest that a reduction in
   locomotor activity as well as a preference for fruit species with a high
   sugar content enable C. medius to deposit large quantities of fat in a
   few weeks.},

Title = {Coccidia (Apicomplexa : Eimeriidae) in the primates and the Scandentia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},
Pages = {761-797},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The coccidia (protistan phylum Apicomplexa Levine, 1970) comprise a
   large group of obligate intracellular parasites commonly found in all
   classes of vertebrate hosts and in some invertebrates. This review
   focuses on the largest family in this group, Eimeriidae Minchin, 1903,
   because its members are among the most prevalent and specious of all
   parasite groups. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of information
   regarding the eimeriid coccidia of Primates and their close relatives,
   and no taxonomic summation is currently available. We review all
   published descriptions of species of Cyclospora, Eimeria and Isospora
   that infect Scandentia and Primates. Some of the names of eimeriid
   species from hosts in these orders are invalid, either because rules
   concerning the naming of new species (International Code of Zoological
   Nomenclature) were not followed and/or because the original description
   was so incomplete and of such little use that the name must be relegated
   to a species inquirendae. In the Scandentia, only Tupia and Ptilocercus
   have valid coccidian species described from them: Eimeria ferruginea, E.
   modesta, and E. tupaiae in Tupaia and E. ptilocerci in Ptilocercus. Of
   the 60 genera of Primates only 14 (Alouatta, Aotus, Ateles, Cacajao,
   Callimico, Callithrix, Cebus, Galago, Homo, Macaca, Nycticebus,
   Saguinus, Saimiri, and Tarsius) have 6 Eimeria (E. coucangi, E. galago,
   E. lemuris, E. nycticebi, E. otolicini, E. pachylepyron), 7 Isospora (I.
   arctopitheci, I. belli, I. callimico, I. cebi, I. endocallimici, I.
   saimiriae, I. natalensis) and I Cyclospora (C. cayetanensis) described
   from them. In addition, one new name, an Eimeria sp., is included. We
   identify eight junior synonyms and note 4 species inquirendae.
   Primatologists should be more receptive to multidisciplinary approaches
   by working with parasitologists to use comparative parasite data that
   might provide insights into primate sociality and habitat use. The
   coccidia are ideal specimens for such cooperative efforts because they
   can be collected easily by noninvasive fecal collections. We describe
   methods to collect and preserve oocysts, noting that formalin and PVA,
   preservatives used to collect helminth stages (worms, worm eggs), will
   destroy the structural integrity of coccidian oocysts and make their
   identification impossible.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {We have isolated the prosimian lemur homologues for STS and SRY. FISH
   unambiguously co-localized STS with SHOX, IL3RA, ANT3 and PRK into the
   meiotic X-Y pairing region (PAR) of lemurs. In contrast to the close
   proximity of SRY to the pseudoautosomal boundary (PAB) on the Y
   chromosome in simian primates, SRY maps distant from the PAR in lemurs.
   Most interestingly, we were able to determine a DNA sequence divergence
   of 12.5\% between the human and lemur SRY HMG box. This divergence
   directs to a 52 million year period of separate evolution of human and
   lemur SRY genes. Phylogenetically, this time period falls in between the
   times that prosimians and New World monkeys branched from the human
   lineage. Thus, we conclude that similar to 52 million years ago a
   transposition of SRY into the ancestral eutherian PAR distal to STS and
   PRK defined a new PAB in a simian progenitor. By this event, STS and
   PRK, amongst other genes, were excluded from the X-Y crossover process
   and thus became susceptible to rearrangements and/or deterioration on
   the Y chromosome in simian primates.},

Title = {Primates and their pinworm parasites: The Cameron hypothesis revisited},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Pages = {523-546},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A morphologically based cladistic analysis of the Enterobiinae, which
   includes most of the Oxyuridae parasitic in Primates, allows a
   reevaluation of the Cameron's hypothesis of close coevolution with
   cospeciation between hosts and parasites. Each of the three genera
   separated in the Enterobiinae fits with one of the suborders defined in
   Primates: Lemuricola with the Strepsirhini, Trypanoxyuris with the
   Platyrrhini, and Enterobius with the Catarrhini. Inside each of the
   three main groups, the subdivisions observed in the parasite tree also
   fit with many of the subdivisions generally accepted within the Primate
   order. These results confirm the subgroups previously described in the
   subfamily and support Cameron's hypothesis in its aspect of association
   by descent. Although the classification of the Enterobiinae generally
   closely underlines the classification of Primates, several discordances
   also are observed. These are discussed case by case, with use of
   computed reconstruction scenarios. Given that the occurrences of the
   same pinworm species as a parasite for several congeneric host species
   is not the generalized pattern, and given that several occurrences also
   are observed in which the speciations of the parasites describe a more
   complex network, Cameron's hypothesis. of a slower rhythm of speciation
   in the parasites can be considered partly refuted. The presence of two
   genera parasitic on squirrels in a family that contains primarily
   primate parasites also is discussed. The cladistic analysis does not
   support close relationships between the squirrel parasites and suggests
   an early separation from the Enterobiinae for the first (Xeroxyuris),
   and a tardy host-switching from the Platyrrhini to the squirrels for the
   second (Rodentoxyuris).},

Abstract = {Comparative gene mapping and chromosome painting permit the tentative
   reconstruction of ancestral karyotypes. The modern human karyotype is
   proposed to differ from that of the most recent common ancestor of
   catarrhine primates by two major rearrangements. The first was the
   fission of an ancestral chromosome to produce the homologues of human
   chromosomes 14 and 15. This fission occurred before the divergence of
   gibbons from humans and other apes. The second was the fusion of two
   ancestral chromosomes to form human chromosome 2. This fusion occurred
   after the divergence of humans and chimpanzees. Moving further back in
   time, homologues of human chromosomes 3 and 21 were formed by the
   fission of an ancestral linkage group that combined loci of both human
   chromosomes, whereas homologues of human chromosomes 12 and 22 were
   formed by a reciprocal translocation between two ancestral chromosomes.
   Both events occurred at some time after our most recent common ancestor
   with lemurs. Less direct evidence suggests that the short and long arms
   of human chromosomes 8, 16 and 19 were unlinked in this ancestor.
   Finally, the most recent common ancestor of primates and artiodactyls is
   proposed to have possessed a chromosome that combined loci from human
   chromosomes 4 and 8p, a chromosome that combined loci from human
   chromosomes 16q and 19q, and a chromosome that combined loci from human
   chromosomes 2p and 20.},

Volume = {67},
Number = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Species richness has classically been thought to increase from the poles
   towards the Equator, and from high elevations down to sea-level.
   However, the largest radiation of butterflies in Madagascar, the
   subtribe Mycalesina jc. 67 spp. does not exhibit such a monotonic
   pattern, either for empirical records or for interpolated species
   ranges. Instead, summation of mycalesine ranges generates a domed curve
   of species richness values approximately symmetric around mid latitudes
   within the island, a pattern most smoothly exhibited by the wider
   ranging and better known species, and a less symmetric curve peaking
   near mid elevations. Hotspots for the summation of 1183 species ranges
   and seven out of the ten groups of insects and vertebrates analysed
   butterflies, cicindelid and enariine melonthid beetles, ctenuchiine
   moths, chameleons, frogs, birds, lemurs, tenrecs, and rodents also occur
   at both mid latitudes and elevations. The most strongly parabolic
   pattern is shown by animals (637 spp.) whose ranges are confined to the
   highly linear rainforest biome. This rainforest species richness curve
   is resilient in shape even after controlling for particular effects of
   area and irregular sample effort. In sharp contrast, at least eight
   different environmental parameters for the rainforest biome tend to
   increase monotonically towards the northern, more tropical, boundary, a
   trend evident only in species richness gradients of more narrow-ranging
   species. The one-dimensional latitudinal species richness curves and
   hotspots observed in fact best reflect overall the geometric predictions
   of a null model for ranked range size partitions of the regional species
   pool. This analytical model is based on the uniform probability
   distribution, and assumes that species ranges are constrained by the
   position of biome or island boundaries. The same logarithmic equations
   applied iteratively to longitude also accurately predict hotspots for
   more realistic species ranges containing gaps, as shown for
   two-dimensional species richness patterns for the Madagascan rainforest
   dataset. Biogeographic and conservation implications of the bounded
   range overlap concept are discussed. (C) 1999 The Linnean Society of

Year = {1999},

Abstract = {A substantially complete skull and mandible of the primitive adapiform
   Cantius is reported from the Early Eocene Willwood Formation of Wyoming.
   The mandible contains an almost complete lower dentition in which the
   lower incisors are strongly inclined and have spatulate crowns, It is
   larger than I-1, and the canine is large and projecting. The cranium
   shares many features with those of Notharctus and Smilodectes but
   differs in having nasals that broaden proximally. Presence of a
   prominent canine and strong sagittal crest may indicate that it
   represents a male. The basicranium preserves auditory structures almost
   identical to those in extant noncheirogaleid lemurs, including a large
   bony tube for the stapedial artery and a small, open sulcus for the
   distal portion of the promontorial artery.
   The dentition is sufficiently primitive to be compatible with a
   relationship to either strepsirrhines or anthropoids, but the anatomy of
   the auditory region is more consistent with either specific relationship
   to lemurs or, more likely, a basal position that approximates the
   euprimate morphotype.
   Certain features of the basicranium of ``Hesperobemur{''} actius,
   described by Gunnell ({[}1995] Am, J. Phys. Anthropol. 98:447-470) as
   being unlike that of any other adapiform, were either misinterpreted or
   are apparently no longer present in the holotype. Reassessment of these
   and other features indicates that in fact ``H.{''} actius differs little
   from Cantius and should not be separated from the latter at the genus
   level, although on dental grounds the species appears to be distinct (as
   C. actircs). (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {A chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium vivax (AMRU-1) from Papua
   New Guinea has been adapted to grow in 4 species of Aotus monkeys (Aotus
   lemurinus griseimembra, Aotus vociferanus, Aotus nancymai, and Aotus
   azarae boliviensis), hybrid Aotus monkeys, and Saimiri boliviensis
   monkeys. Whereas it was possible to infect Saimiri monkeys with this
   parasite by inoculation of parasitized erythrocytes, only 42\% of
   Saimiri monkeys became infected, compared to 92\% of Aotus monkeys
   attempted. Comparative mosquito feedings showed that only A. vociferans,
   A. l. griseimembra, and Saimiri boliviensis monkeys produced infections
   in mosquitoes. Oocysts were observed on the guts of the 4 species of
   mosquitoes used (Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles stephensi, A,Anopheles
   freeborni, and Anoplteles dirus), but sporozoite transmission was
   effected only with the intravenous inoculation of sporozoites from An.
   dirus into an A. l. griseimembra monkey.},

Title = {Two related G protein-coupled receptors: The distribution of GPR7 in rat

Journal = {MOLECULAR BRAIN RESEARCH},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {GPR7 and GPR8, orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) genes, expressed
   in the brain and periphery share highest sequence identity to each other
   and significant similarity with opioid and somatostatin receptors. To
   further our knowledge of GPR7's physiological function, we performed in
   situ hybridization analyses of rat brain to reveal specific patterns of
   expression in the brain. GPR7 mRNA was found to be discretely localized
   in areas of the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus and cortex. We
   previously reported that GPR7 was highly conserved in both human and
   rodent orthologs while GPR8 was not found in the rodent {[}9]. We
   speculated that GPR8 originated after the divergence of the human and
   rodent. Using primers designed from human GPR8, we isolated lemur GPR8
   and subsequently aligned human, monkey, and lemur GPR8 orthologs to
   design primers recognizing highly conserved regions of GPR8. Using these
   primers, orthologs of GPR7 and GPR8 were isolated by the PCR from
   rabbit, tree shrew, and flying lemur, as well as GPR7 in the rat.
   Subsequent analysis of the clones obtained demonstrated that both GPR7
   and GPR8 sequences were highly conserved amongst the species studied,
   but a rodent GPR8 was not isolated. The absence of a GPR8 gene in the
   rodent suggests that GPR8 originated from gene duplication of GPR7 after
   the rodent line diverged from the rabbit, tree shrew, flying lemur,
   lemur, monkey and human lines. In addition, the taxonomic distribution
   of GPR8 is consistent with molecular studies grouping rabbits with
   primates, tree shrews and flying lemurs rather than with rodents. (C)

Title = {Physiological suppression of sexual function of subordinate males: A
   subtle form of intrasexual competition among male sifakas (Propithecus

Year = {1999},
Volume = {66},

Abstract = {In contrast to most anthropoid primates, sifakas (Propithecus
   veureauxi), like many group-living lemurs, exhibit a number of features
   that deviate from predictions of sexual selection theory. Despite a
   promiscuous mating system, they lack sexual dimorphism, suggesting that
   physical combat plays only a minor role in intrasexual competition for
   receptive females. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that
   socioendrocrinological mechanisms contribute to suppression of
   reproductive function of subordinate males. For that purpose, 10 male
   sifakas from five social groups were observed for 669 focal animal hours
   for 4 months, including the mating season, in Western Madagascar.
   Concomitantly, 315 fecal samples of these animals were collected and the
   concentration of immunoreactive testosterone was quantified by
   enzymeimmunoassay procedures. Clear dominance relationships existed
   among coresident males. Testosterone levels of dominant males were
   significantly higher than those of subordinates during, as well as
   outside, the mating season. Additionally, the increase in testosterone
   levels prior to the mating season was more pronounced for dominant than
   for subordinate males. These findings are in accordance with the
   hypothesis of suppression of sexual function of subordinate males,
   probably providing dominant males with an advantage in sperm
   competition. If reproductive success is mainly determined by this
   nonagonistic form of intrasexual competition, the results of this study
   contribute an important piece to the puzzle of lacking sexual dimorphism
   in P. verreauxi. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Abstract = {Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), has caused the deaths of many species
   of animals in zoological parks and research institutions. The Audubon
   Park Zoo, (New Orleans, Louisiana, USA) attempted vaccination of several

   engineered, live attenuated Mengo virus (vMCO) at the Audubon Park Zoo
   and Miami Metro Zoo, (Miami, Florida, USA) from December 1996 to June
   1997. Several species of animals were vaccinated with vMCO, which is
   serologically indistinguishable from the field strain of EMCV. Serum
   samples were taken at the time of vaccination and again 21 days later,
   then submitted for serum neutralization titers against EMCV: The
   vaccinate species included red capped mangebey (Cercocebus torquatus),
   colobus (Colobus guereza), angolan colobus (Colobus angolensis), ruffed

Abstract = {Experimental lemurs either were infected orally with the agent of bovine
   spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or were maintained as uninfected control
   animals. Immunohistochemical examination for proteinase-resistant
   protein (prion protein or PrP) was performed on tissues from two
   infected but still asymptomatic lemurs, killed 5 months after infection,
   and from three uninfected control lemurs, Control tissues shelved no
   staining, whereas PrP was detected in the infected animals in tonsil,
   gastrointestinal tract and associated lymphatic tissues, and spleen. In
   addition, PrP was detected in ventral and dorsal roots of the cervical
   spinal cord, and within the spinal cord PrP could be traced in nerve
   tracts as far as the cerebral cortex. Similar patterns of PrP
   immunoreactivity were seen in two symptomatic and 18 apparently healthy
   lemurs in three different French primate centers, all of which had been
   fed diets supplemented with a beef protein product manufactured by a
   British company that has since ceased to include beef in its veterinary
   nutritional products. This study of BSE-infected lemurs early in their
   incubation period extends previous pathogenesis studies of the
   distribution of infectivity and PrP in natural and experimental scrapie,
   The similarity of neuropathology and PrP immunostaining patterns in
   experimentally infected animals to those observed in both symptomatic
   and asymptomatic animals in primate centers suggests that BSE
   contamination of zoo animals may have been more widespread than is
   generally appreciated.},

Abstract = {Related genomes tend to be colonized by the same or similar repetitive
   sequence elements. Analysis of these elements provides useful taxonomic
   information. We have sequenced Alu repeats from tarsier and compared
   them with those from strepsirhine prosimians (lemurs, sifaka, and
   galago) and the human genome. Tarsier elements cluster with Alu
   subfamilies from the human lineage. The oldest subfamily in tarsier and
   the most abundant human subfamilies share an RNA secondary structure
   motif which is absent both in the earliest dimeric Alu do and in the
   strepsirhine elements. These findings are consistent with the view that
   tarsiers form a sister clade with anthropoides rather than with other
   prosimians. Alu repeats in tarsier genome are relatively old, which
   indicates a dramatic slowdown or even an arrest of these elements'

Abstract = {The presence of Rh30-like polypeptides with an apparent relative
   molecular mass of 33000 in the erythrocyte membranes from nonhuman
   primates and nonprimate mammals (mouse, rat, and dog) was demonstrated
   by immunoblotting. Nonhuman primates (orangutan, baboon, New World
   monkeys, lemur) and mouse Rh-like transcripts were amplified and
   sequenced. Analysis of the deduced amino acids sequences allowed us to
   determine the amino acid variability of Rh-like polypeptides which
   correlated with the hydrophylicity indexes. Hence, the putative
   transmembrane domains exhibited low indexes of variability, while the
   highest indexes were observed on extramembrane loops with a maximum on
   the sixth external loop. The cDNA sequences were compared with those
   previously reported in human, nonhuman primates, and cattle. The time of
   coalescence of mammalian Rh cDNA sequences was estimated by phylogenetic
   analysis to be 100 million years.},

Title = {Mating system of Microcebus murinus},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {127-133},
Abstract = {Microcebus murinus, a small nocturnal lemur from Madagascar, has
   retained features of ancient primates. Based on these ancestral traits,
   its social organization has often been used as a model for early primate
   social systems. In captivity it breeds polygynously, i.e., one male
   mates with several females, while females usually copulate only with the
   dominant male. The present project tested whether or not sexual size
   dimorphism, spatial distribution, and relative testis size of M. murinus
   correspond with predictions of the sexual selection theory concerning
   polygynous mating systems. The study was combined with a mark-recapture
   study and radio tracking of 12 animals in 1993 in a dry deciduous forest
   of western Madagascar at the end of the dry season. Large overlapping
   home ranges in males, lack of sexual size dimorphism, and relatively
   large testes suggest a multi-male mating system, i.e., one that is
   promiscuous rather than polygynous. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-48},
Abstract = {Seven measurements were performed on the cerebellar complex of 30
   specimens, covering three species each of Cheirogaleidae, Lemuridae and
   Indriidae, and Daubentonia, and three each of Lorisinae, Galaginae, and
   Tarsius. The items measured were the volume of the medial (CM),
   interposed (CI), and lateral(CL) cerebellar nuclei, ventral pens (VPo),
   inferior olivary principal (OLIPr) and accessory (OLIAc) nuclei, and the
   vestibular nuclear complex (VES). The raw data for these measurements
   were previously reported {[}Matano et al., Folia Primatol 44:171-181,
   182-203, 1985; 47:189-203, 1986; Matano, Anthropol Soc Nippon 100:69-82,
   1992]. For this paper, the relative size of each nucleus was expressed
   in terms of size indices based upon the allometric line obtained by
   reduced major axis analysis and comparisons between species within
   family or subfamily were made. Lemur showed one of the highest
   cerebellar complex indices and Lepilemur one of the lowest. Generally,
   the three cerebellar nuclei (CM, CI, and CL) were enlarged to the same
   extent in each species. Only Daubentonia showed higher size indices of
   CL, VPo, and OLIPr than of CM and OLIAc. Characteristics of the
   cerebellar complex enlargement of Tarsius were comparable to those of
   prosimians. The VES indices for non-leaping Lorisinae were markedly
   lower than those for the actively leaping Galago and Tarsius. Am. J.

Title = {Theatre as a tool for conservation of threatened species},
Journal = {DODO},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {158-170},
Abstract = {This paper describes the use of theatre as a means of working with local
   communities in Madagascar to encourage environmental and conservation
   actions. We chose theatre as a means for reciprocal message transmission
   for several reasons: 1) it involves mainly oral skills, which in rural
   areas with high rates of illiteracy aids understanding; 2) people can be
   both actors and audience; and 3) this popular theatre is simple and
   cheap to organise. The villages where the events take place are selected
   because of their proximity to or impact on natural environments and
   threatened species, and their cultural and socio-economic importance.
   The theme, on which all activities are focused, is discussed with
   village leaders; usually it is either the habitat or the animals which
   make the region unique. Organisation is done by the villagers, who are
   both actors, and audience, and events are attended by and involve the
   entire village, local officials, and partners. A case study from Lac
   Alaotra, home of the critically endangered Alaotran gentle lemur
   Hapalemur griseus alaotrensis, describes the ``joro{''}, a ceremony to
   ask for blessings, and real theatre pieces based on traditional legend,
   performed by school students. The oral communication is followed up by
   written documents and actions. In Alaotra, actions following from the
   theatre festivals included a fishing ``dina{''} or convention in order
   to manage lake products sustainably, and replanting of areas of marsh.
   The theatre theme ``The marsh is life{''} became so widely known that
   the most important socio-economic event in the region was called the
   Marsh Fair. Interactive discussion and theatre on locally relevant
   environmental and conservation topics appears to be an effective way of
   raising awareness and empowering people to manage their natural
   resources, while also supporting traditional culture.},

Abstract = {Research on palms has: burgeoned in the decade since Genera Palmarum
   (GP) appeared. In 1987, approximately 80 genera were in need of
   monographs, 45 of these are now complete or in progress, leaving about
   35 genera still lacking a modern assessment. Fifteen of the 200 numbered
   genera and Antongilia (suggested in GP to be a species of Neodypsis)
   have been placed in synonymy. Thus, the number of genera has changed
   from 200 to 189. Four new genera, Satranala (Coryphoideae).
   Lemurophoenix and Voanioala (Arecoideae), and Aphandra
   (Phytelephantoideae) have been discovered, described, and named, and a
   fifth new genus, Paschalococos, based on a recently extinct cocoid palm
   from Easter Island, has also been described and named. The little known
   Medemia, Masoala, Carpoxylon, and Goniocladus and several other
   incompletely known genera have been rediscovered and reassessed. Major
   progress has been made in morphology and anatomy. including a synthesis
   of the structural biology of palms, and extensive contributions to stem
   anatomy in subfamily Calamoideae. Root anatomy has been studied for all
   subfamilies except Arecoideae. Pollen, with an assessment of fossil
   pollens and their assignment to palms, and chromosomal karyotype
   structure have been surveyed for all subfamilies. Cladistic analyses of
   morphological and of molecular characters from both restriction fragment
   length polymorphisms in chloroplast DNA and sequencing of chloroplast
   and nuclear genes have provided insights as to what groups are
   monophyletic and how some are related. However, if our goal is a
   phylogeny of all genera and a revision of the classification, such
   studies are far from complete: indeed, many are being reported for the
   first time in this symposium.},

Abstract = {A 1340-bp cDNA fragment encoding the lemurian presenilin 2 protein (PS2)
   was isolated from a Microcebus murinus brain cDNA library by PCR using
   oligonucleotide primers based on the nucleotide sequence of the human
   gene. Analysis of five isolated clones showed that the sequence encoded
   a 448-amino-acid open reading frame, 95.5\% identical to the human and
   93.5\% identical to the mouse presenilin 2 sequences. However, neither
   the localization of the 2 positions in PS2 nor that of the 43 positions
   in PS1 associated with early onset Alzheimer's disease were changed.
   Expression of the presenilin 2 was detected by RT-PCR and compared with
   that of presenilin I and beta APP in the brain and in peripheral tissues
   (liver, kidney, and spleen). Immunohistochemistry with a specific
   polyclonal antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide from the
   N-terminal part of the human PS2 showed that the protein is distributed
   throughout the microcebe brain, in vascular and nerve structures. In
   cortical and in subcortical areas, PS2 labeling was weak and granular in
   appearance and was scattered throughout the cytoplasm of many neurones,
   extending into neurites. The gene expression of PS2 increased with age
   but was not affected by the presence of numerous amyloid plaques. Double
   labeling immunocytochemistry detected very few neurones with combined
   immunoreactivity PS2 and APP, or PS2 and Tau. (C) 1998 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {The relationships within the superorder Archonta, which contains the
   orders Dermoptera (flying lemurs), Scandentia (tree shrews), Chiroptera
   (bats), and Primates, were examined through the analysis of five newly
   derived and complete mitochondrial 12S; rRNA sequences. The new data is
   combined with 83 additional known mammalian sequences to provide a full
   phylogenetic sampling. Phylogenetic hypotheses are generated using PAUP
   3.1.1 (Swofford {[}1993] Illinois Natural History Survey,Champaign, IL)
   through analyses of all characters equally weighted, transversions only,
   and the effect of alignment gaps on phylogeny. The Parsimony Jackknifer
   (Farris et al. {[}1996] Cladistics 12:99-124) was used to assess the
   level of ambiguity present in the sequence data, and therefore the
   strength of the tee topologies. The conclusions of Springer and Douzery
   (1996, J. Mel. Evol. 43:357-373) which states that 12S rRNA is reliable
   to a time depth of 100 mya is unsupported by these analyses. The
   usefulness of 12S rRNA to aid in solving Archonta relationships and
   others of similar time depth is found to be suspect. (C) 1998

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to identify causes for lower population
   densities of mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) in secondary than in
   primary dry deciduous forests of western Madagascar. Variations in the
   abundance of Microcebus murinus are linked to the capacity to enter
   energy-saving torpor during the dry season. Under natural conditions in
   primary forest, Microcebus murinus can maintain daily torpor (and
   possibly hibernation) as long as body temperatures remain below 28
   degrees C. Females are more likely to hibernate than males, resulting in
   skewed sec ratios of captured Microcebus murinus in the primary forest
   In the secondary forest the seu ratio of subjects captured during the
   dry season is more balanced than in primacy forest indicating that fewer
   females go into torpor in secondary than in primary forest. Secondary
   forests have fewer large standing or fallen trees that might provide
   holes as shelter for Microcebus murinus Ambient temperatures are higher
   in secondary than in primary forests and higher outside than inside free
   holes. These high ambient temperatures might hinder the ability of
   Microcebus murinus to maintain torpor for prolonged periods in secondary
   forests. Mouse lemurs from secondary forest have lower body mass than in
   primary forest. The year-to-year recapture rate is zero in secondary
   forest and thus significantly lower than in primary forest. This
   indicates that survival rates are lower in secondary than in primacy
   forests Thus, secondary forests may be of limited value as buffer zones
   or even corridors for mouse lemurs.},

Abstract = {Androgen effects mediated by the androgen receptor (AR) are essential
   for male reproductive development and virilization. Comparison of AR DNA
   coding sequence from five primate species, Homo sapiens (human), Pan
   troglodytes (chimpanzee), Papio hamadryas (baboon), Macaca fascicularis
   (macaque), and Eulemur fulvus collaris (collared brown lemur), supports
   their phylogeny with complete conservation of the DNA and steroid
   binding domain protein sequence. A linear increase in trinucleotide
   repeat expansion of homologous CAG and GGC sequences occurs in the
   NH2-terminal transcriptional activation region and is proportional to
   the time of species divergence. A serine phosphate/glutamine repeat
   interaction is observed where increasing CAG repeat length is associated
   with an increased rate of serine 94 phosphorylation. Disparity in the
   calculated and apparent molecular weight with CAG repeat expansion of an
   AR NH2-terminal fragment suggests self-aggregation with increasing
   glutamine repeat length into the pathological range. These results
   suggest that a CAG/glutamine repeat expanded during divergence of the
   higher primate species, which may have a direct effect on AR structure
   and support a common pathway in CAG trigenic diseases in the
   pathophysiology of neurodegeneration observed in X-linked spinal bulbar
   and muscular atrophy.},

Abstract = {Objective: We report the first case of cleft palate in a newborn male
   gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla).
   Case History and Results: The full-term infant was born to clinically
   healthy, wild-caught parents and survived 5 days. Autopsy disclosed a
   unilateral cleft palate, moderate scalp hemorrhage (birth versus
   postnatal trauma), cerebral edema, and a sterile fibrin vegetation in
   the heart. The palate was also shorter and narrower than expected, and
   the biorbital breadth was reduced; otherwise, growth and development
   appeared normal, Standard cranial and intraoral radiographs and
   three-dimensional reconstructions of computerized tomographic (CT) scans
   provided thorough and noninvasive methods of studying the craniofacial
   complex and extracranial skeleton. By this technique, major findings
   were: intact premaxilla, interpremaxillary, and premaxillary/maxillary
   sutures; intramaxillary cleft with ipsilateral choanal atresia; mildly
   asymmetric inferior turbinates; and normal nasal septum and vomer.
   Conclusions: Except for choanal atresia, cleft palate was not associated
   with other major craniofacial or extracranial anomalies in this case.
   Choanal atresia has been observed at times with cleft palate, but to our
   knowledge, the association has not been reported in nonhuman primates.
   Cleft palate, with or without cleft lip, has been recognized in a
   variety of nonhuman primates, including the lemur, marmoset, tamarin,
   squirrel monkey, and macaque. Some occurrences are spontaneous, while
   others are syndromic and/or arise from genetic or teratogenic
   influences. Each mode of presentation is poorly understood in nonhuman
   primates, but in this case, the absence of relevant environmental or
   parental history suggests that the occurrence was spontaneous. Anatomic
   studies of nonhuman primates are particularly valuable when they involve
   endangered species and will hopefully increase our understanding of the
   pathogenesis and etiology of congenital disorders, as well as other
   relationships between nonhuman primates and humans.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {172-182},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {To get insight into the early evolution of the primate Alu elements, we
   characterized sequences of these repeats from the Malagasy prosimians,
   lemurs (Lemuridae) and sifakas (Indriidae), as well as from galagos
   (Lorisidae). These sequences were compared with the oldest Alu species
   known from the human genome: dimeric Alu J and S and free Alu monomers.
   Our analysis indicates that about 60 Myr ago, before the prosimian
   divergence, free left and right monomers formed an Alu heterodimer
   connected by a 19-nucleotide-long A-rich linker. The resulting elements
   successfully propagated in diverging primate lineages until about
   similar to 20 Myr ago, conserving similar sequence features and
   essentially the same Alu RNA secondary structure. We suggest that until
   that time the same `'retropositional niche'', molecular machinery making
   possible the proliferation by retroposition, constrained the evolution
   of Alu elements in extant primate species. These constraints became
   subsequently relaxed. In the Malagasy prosimians the dimeric Alu
   continued to amplify after acquiring a 34- to 36-nucleotide extension of
   their linker segment, whereas in the galago genome the ``retropositional
   niche{''} was occupied by novel short elements.},

Abstract = {In the male lesser mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), a polygamous
   long-day breeder of which the life span may reach 12-14 years, the
   effects of aging on socio-sexual relationships were studied on 44
   captive animals of various ages. In this primate, new dominance
   relationships must be established at the beginning of each breeding
   season. During the breeding season induced by exposure to artificial
   long days, preoestrous females were introduced into cages of paired
   males to elicit sexual competition. Sexual behaviors, social
   interactions through chemical signals, and dominance relationships were
   recorded in paired males either of similar age (young or aged pairs), or
   of mixed ages. In all pairs, competition for priority access to females
   always occurred and dominance relationships were established unrelated
   to body weight. Although aged animals exhibited significantly less
   number of sexual and aggressive behaviors, they outranked younger males
   excepted when reaching oldest age. Independent of male's age, the
   typical pattern of seasonal rhythm of testosterone was observed, but
   aged males demonstrated a significant reduction in mean hormonal levels
   (25.5 +/- 2.8 ng/mL, n = 8) compared to young animals (50 +/- 2.7 ng/mL,
   n = 8). Moreover, their hormonal response to photoperiod was
   phase-shifted leading to reduced testosterone values when females
   entered oestrus. Despite the fact that testosterone levels and sexual
   behaviors decreased with aging in this primate, older males reached a
   dominant position, increasing thus their reproductive success. (C) 1998

Abstract = {Great apes (Pongidae) possess a chromosome similar to human chromosome
   21 (HSA21), whose trisomy was described in both chimpanzee and
   orangutan. Having studied more than 200 mammalian species by chromosome
   banding techniques and reconstructed Primates phylogeny, we
   reinvestigated, using fluorescence in situ hybridization, primate and
   non-primate mammals that we considered to possess a karyotype
   representative of their taxonomic group. DNA sequences from HSA21 and
   human chromosome 3 (HSA3) are synthenic and form a large and similar
   chromosome in species from distinct orders, such as Primates, Carnivora,
   Artiodactyla and Scandentia. In Primates, this syntheny was maintained
   in lemurs and was disrupted by a fission in Old World monkeys
   (catarrhines). Another fission occurred in New World monkeys
   (platyrrhines), conserving a syntheny between HSA21 and a very short
   segment of HSA3 DNA sequences. Thus, the ancestral HSA21 was formed
   after the divergence between platyrrhines and catarrhines and before the
   emergence of Cercopithecidae. This exposed the human and Pongidae
   ancestry to trisomy 21 for a period of 30-50 million years, while, in
   other catarrhines, the equivalent of HSA21 was further involved in
   various translocations forming large chromosomes whose aneuploidy, very
   probably incompatible with life, protected them against trisomy 21.},

Title = {Base-compositional biases and the bat problem. III. The question of
   microchiropteran monophyly},

Abstract = {Using single-copy DNA hybridization, we carried out a whole genome study
   of 16 bats (from ten families) and five outgroups (two primates and one
   each dermopteran, scandentian, and marsupial). Three of the bat species
   represented as many families of Rhinolophoidea, and these always
   associated with the two representatives of Pteropodidae. All other
   microchiropterans, however, formed a monophyletic: unit displaying
   interrelationships largely in accord with current opinion. Thus
   noctilionoids comprised one clade, while vespertilionids, emballonurids,
   and molossids comprised three others, successively more closely related
   in that sequence. The unexpected position of rhinolophoids may be due
   either to the high AT bias they share with pteropodids, or it may be
   phylogenetically authentic. Reanalysis of the data with varying
   combinations of the five outgroups does not indicate a rooting problem,
   and the inclusion of many bat lineages divided at varying levels
   similarly discounts long branch attraction as an explanation for the
   pteropodid -rhinolophoid association. If rhinolophoids are indeed
   specially related to pteropodids, many synapomorphies of Microchiroptera
   are called into question, not least the unitary evolution of
   echolocation (although this feature may simply have been lost in
   pteropodids). Further, a rhinolophoid-pteropodid relationship-if
   true-has serious implications for the classification of bats. Finally,
   among the outgroups, an apparent sister-group relation of Dermoptera and
   Primates suggests that flying lemurs do not represent the ancestors of
   some or all bats; yet, insofar as gliding of the type implemented in
   dermopterans is an appropriate model for the evolution of powered
   mammalian flying, the position of Cynocephalus in our tree indirectly
   strengthens the argument that true flight could have evolved more than
   once among bats.},

   of Lepilemur leucopus (circa 800 animals per square kilometre) can be
   explained by its peculiar adaptation to leaf eating. The stability of
   the nocturnal lemur popultation in areas frequently visited by tourists
   shows that opening animal reserves with adequate protection does not

Abstract = {Human D4 dopamine receptor (D4DR) is polymorphic in terms of the repeat
   numbers of the 48-base pairs (bp) sequence located in the third
   cytoplasmic loop of the receptor. The repeated sequence and its
   polymorphism in D4DR genes have also been identified in higher non-human
   primates, suggesting that the structure of D4DR has been maintained
   during primate evolution. To clarify the origin and divergence of the
   polymorphism in the D4DR gene, we determined the nucleotide sequence of
   this region of the D4DR gene in several species of prosimians and the
   tree shrew, a species which is closely related to primates. Prosimians
   except the tarsier had one or two unit(s) of the 48-bp sequence, and
   conserved sequences were recognized in most of the units of the
   prosimians. The tree shrew had only one unit of the 48-bp sequence, and
   its sequence was 71-75\% identical to those of the units of galago,
   loris, and lemur. These findings suggest that the ancestral primate
   presumably had one 48-bp unit, and duplication of the unit occurred at
   the stage of prosimians. Tarsiers appeared to be distinct from other
   prosimians and simians because of the high repeat numbers of units and
   their sequences.},

Month = {MAR 29},
Abstract = {We conducted a series of parallel DNA-hybridization experiments on a
   small group of bats (species of Pteropus, Rhinolophus, Noctilio and
   Pteronotus) and outgroups (Lemur, Cynocephalus, Didelphis), using
   whole-genome labels and tracers made from extracts enriched with AT and
   two levels of GC content. FITCH (additive phylogenetic trees) topologies
   were constructed from the four sets of comparisons, indexed as both
   Delta T(mode) and Delta NPHs (normalized percentage of hybridization).
   Based on our previous work showing that the shared AT bias of
   pteropodids and some microchiropterans may affect the rank-ordering of
   taxa based on either AT-or GC-rich labels, our expectation was that the
   resulting trees would show differing topologies when generated from
   tracers made with the variously enriched DNA extracts. Whereas there was
   some variation among the trees, most of them grouped the bats together,
   and almost all paired the representative megachiropteran and
   rhinolophoid microchiropteran as sister-taxa in contrast to the other
   microchiropterans. As the pteropodid-rhinolophoid relationship is an
   unexpected and unlikely one, we attribute this association to an AT bias
   that was not obviated even by our most GC-rich labels, and suggest that
   such a bias may compromise the truth of some molecular trees.
   Accordingly, we believe the broader issue of bat monophyly remains
   unresolved by DNA-hybridization and probably also by gene-sequencing
   studies.},

Title = {Immune response to a hepatitis B DNA vaccine in Aotus monkeys: A
   comparison of vaccine formulation, route, and method of administration},
Journal = {MOLECULAR MEDICINE},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Background: Attempts to optimize DNA vaccines in mice include using
   different routes of administration and different formulations. It may be
   more relevant to human use to carry such studies out in nonhuman
   primates. Here we compare different approaches to delivery of a DNA
   vaccine against the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Aotus monkeys.
   Materials and Methods: Thirty-two adult Aotus l. lemurinus monkeys
   divided into 8 groups of four were immunized with 400 mu g of a DNA
   vaccine which encoded hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). DNA in saline
   was administered by intradermal (ID) or intramuscular (IM) injection
   with needle and syringe, LM injection with the Biojector(R) needleless
   injection system or combined ID (needle) and IM (Biojebor). DNA
   formulated with cationic liposomes (CellFECTIN)(R) was injected IM with
   needle or Biojector. DNA with added E. coli DNA (100 mu g) was injected
   IM with the Biojector or ID. A ninth group of 4 monkeys was injected LM
   (needle) with Engerix-B, a commercial vaccine containing recombinant
   HBsAg (10 mu g) adsorbed onto alum. Monkeys were boosted in an identical
   fashion to their prime at 8 weeks, but all received the protein vaccine
   (Engerix-B) at 16 weeks. Sera was assessed for antibodies against HBsAg
   (anti-HBs) by enzyme-linked imunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Results: The primary humoral response induced by IM delivery of the DNA
   vaccine was very poor. In most cases there was no detectable anti-HBs
   even after 2 DNA doses but the kinetics of the response to subsequent
   protein indicated that a memory B cell response had been induced. In
   contrast, following IM-administration of DNA using the Biojector,
   detectable anti-HBs were observed in 3 of 8 animals and evidence for
   immunological priming was apparent in an additional 4 of the 8 monkeys.
   ID injection of DNA vaccine in saline induced a potent antibody response
   which was augmented 6-fold by the addition of E. coli DNA. Combining ID
   and IM administration did not improve humoral immunity over ID injection
   alone.
   Conclusions: For immunization of primates with DNA vaccines, ID may be a
   preferable route to LM, although it is not clear whether the Aotus
   monkey is a relevant model for humans in this respect. Nevertheless, the
   use of the Biojector needleless injection system may improve responses
   with IM delivery of DNA vaccines. As well, the immunostimulatory action
   of E. coli DNA may be used to augment the humoral response induced by a
   DNA vaccine.},

Abstract = {In a variety of vertebrates, whether nocturnal or diurnal, the
   production of melatonin, a hormone mainly secreted by the pineal gland,
   is entrained by the daily light:dark cycle, which is a strong circadian
   and circannual zeitgeber, and occurs primarily during the dark phase.
   Because studies have revealed a direct relationship between the duration
   of melatonin signal and the duration of darkness, the pattern of
   melatonin secretion has been suggested to be important in photoperiodic
   measurement {[}1]. Consequently, many studies have been undertaken on
   the role of melatonin production in photoperiod-dependent species
   {[}2-3] and especially in seasonal breeding animals that use daylength
   to time changes in reproductive physiology and behavior. To another
   extent, circadian rhythmicity of melatonin concentration is
   significantly altered in advanced age in several species, including
   human {[}4-5], and these findings suggest that the function of the
   pineal gland may be substantially reduced in aging. The present study
   was carried out on a small nocturnal malagasy prosimian, the lesser
   mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), maintained in laboratory controlled
   photoperiods. This species exhibits various seasonal
   photoperiod-dependent rhythms and has been recently demonstrated to
   present accelerated aging when exposed to manipulations of photoperiodic
   cycles {[}6]. Urine excretion of a melatonin metabolite, the
   6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) was studied, because this metabolite has
   been demonstrated to be an excellent indicator of plasma melatonin
   production in human {[}7]. The aim of this paper was to determine
   changes in the pattern of aMT6s in relation to photoperiod in adult male
   mouse lemur, and the age-related effects on aMT6s production in both
   biologically and chronologically aged mouse lemurs.},

   activity only on the day of oestrus. Furthermore, they uttered a call
   with a complex acoustic structure which is not heard during other
   reproductive phases, the oestrus advertisement trill call. Therefore, in
   mouse lemurs, a combination of olfactory and acoustical signals can
   serve as multimodal oestrus advertisement.},

Abstract = {The systematics of all adapiforms is reviewed at the generic and
   specific levels. A new classification is proposed for the 30 genera of
   adapiforms, containing three families: Notharctidae, Adapidae and
   Sivaladapidae; and one subfamily of uncertain affinities, the new
   Pronycticebinae. A stratophenetic schema summarizing the distribution
   and phylogenetic relationships of all European adapiforms,
   Cercamoniinae, Notharctinae and Adapidae, is given. The particular
   characters of the skull of Pronycticebus gaudryi warrant its isolation
   in a separate subfamily Pronycticebinae, nocturnal adapiforms which are
   of special significance for lemuriform ancestry. Agerinia might pertain
   to the same group. Four genera are proposed as adapids outside the
   European adapine radiation. Amphipithecinae and several other Asiatic
   genera of uncertain affinities are discussed.},

Abstract = {DNA fingerprinting analysis was used to investigate genetic variability
   within and between three wild populations of Eulemur macaco living on
   two islands and on the mainland. The analyses revealed that the genetic
   variability of the population from the smaller island was, as expected,
   lower than that from the larger island. Surprisingly, on the larger
   island the genetic variability was greater than on the mainland. These
   results, in agreement with those previously obtained from blood markers,
   are discussed in relation to the history of these populations, In
   addition, the study suggests that settlement of the smallest island was
   not only by animals originating from the mainland, as previously
   proposed on the basis of blood marker data, but also by lemurs from the
   nearby, larger, island. Evidence is presented that reliable information
   about population structure can be derived only from studies using
   different genetic markers. This information is important to enable
   appropriate conservation programmes to be designed.},

Abstract = {Recent discovery of crania, dentitions, and postcrania of a primitive
   anthropoidean primate, Proteopithecus sylviae, at the late Eocene L-41
   quarry in the Fayum, Egypt, provides evidence of a new taxonomic family
   of early African higher primates, the Proteopithecidae. This family
   could be part of the basal radiation that produced the New World
   platyrrhine primates, or it could be unrelated to any subsequent
   lineages, Although no larger than a small callitrichid or a dwarf lemur,
   this tiny primate already possessed many of the derived features of
   later anthropoids and was a diurnal and probably dimorphic species, In
   dental formula and other dental proportions, as well as in known
   postcranial features, Proteopithecus more nearly resembles platyrrhines
   than does any other Old World higher primate, The small size of the
   Proteopithecus cranium demonstrates that the defining cranial
   haracteristics of Anthropoidea did not arise as a consequence of an
   increase in size during derivation from earlier prosimians.},

   lots of An. freeborni were fed through membranes on the blood of 34
   monkeys. During the days following the parasite count reaching greater

Abstract = {Mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) are prosimian primates described to be

   coefficient was higher for the pallidum (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) than for

   divided by the amygdala and temporal lobe intensity should be a valuable

   female in a prosimian primate (Microcebus murinus)},
Journal = {PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {62},
Number = {5},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In most mammals, olfactory cues play an important role in regulating
   socio-sexual behaviors, but the relative contributions of the main
   olfactory system and the vomeronasal system remain unclear. The lesser
   mouse lemur, a nocturnal prosimian, possesses well-developed
   chemosensory structures, including a functional vomeronasal organ (VNO).
   In this primitive primate, social communication and competition between
   males for priority access to receptive females includes reliance on
   urinary chemical cues. To assess the role of the VNO in mediating males'
   behavioural responses to females, sexually-experienced intact males (C,
   n = 8) or males deprived of their VNO (VNX, n = 8) were put in pairs and
   their socio-sexual behaviors in response to a preoestrous female were
   monitored. Independent of social context (with or without female), VNX
   males exhibited less sniffing behaviors than C males, but their marking
   behaviors, although reduced, were not significantly different. Removal
   of the VNO dramatically reduced the frequency of both sexual behaviors
   (anogenital investigations, mounts) and intermale aggressive behaviors.
   However, VNO removal did not impair successful mating and had no effect
   on plasma testosterone levels. Lastly, VNX males always exhibited a
   significantly lower general activity level than C males. The decrease in
   sexual behaviors and the lack of aggressive intermale competition in
   responses to a preoestrous female possibly proceed from functional
   disturbances of central nervous areas connected to the vomeronasal
   system rather than from a chemosensory deficit per se. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {Nuclear lamins are intermediate filament-type proteins forming a

   previously reported the identification of the human lamin B2 gene that
   maps to the subtelomeric band p13.3 of chromosome 19 in close proximity
   of a human DNA replication origin. Here we report the identification
   within the human lamin B2 gene of a novel repeated element (variable
   number of tandem repeats: VNTR) that appears to have a very recent
   origin, being absent in the genome of mouse and primates such as
   cercopitheques, lemurs and macaques. The VNTR is adjacent to exon 8 of
   the lamin B2 gene which, albeit encoding the nuclear localization signal
   of the protein, is highly divergent both at amino acid and nucleotide
   level among species. Moreover the VNTR, characterized by a repeated unit
   of about 100 bp, covers most of intron 8 of the gene and reiterates both
   the last 7 bp of the upstream exon and the exon!intron junction. RT-PCR
   experiments carried out on HeLa cell RNA suggest that none of the

Abstract = {The nuclear and mitochondrial genomes coevolve to optimize approximately
   100 different interactions necessary for an efficient ATP-generating
   system, This coevolution led to a species-specific compatibility between
   these genomes, We introduced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from different
   primates into mtDNA-less human cells and selected for growth of cells
   with a functional oxidative phosphorylation system, mtDNA from common
   chimpanzee, pigmy chimpanzee, and gorilla were able to restore oxidative
   phosphorylation in the context of a human nuclear background, whereas
   mtDNA from orangutan, and species representative of Old-World monkeys,
   New-World monkeys, and lemurs were not, Oxygen consumption, a sensitive
   index of respiratory function, showed that mtDNA from chimpanzee, pigmy
   chimpanzee, and gorilla replaced the human mtDNA and restored
   respiration to essentially normal levels, Mitochondrial protein
   synthesis was also unaltered in successful `'xenomitochondrial
   cybrids,'' The abrupt failure of mtDNA from primate species that
   diverged from humans as recently as 8-18 million years ago to

Abstract = {We cloned and mapped the dog and/or sheep homologues of two human
   pseudoautosomal genes CSF2RA and ANT3. We also cloned and mapped dog
   and/or sheep homologues of STS and PRKX, which are located nearby on the
   differential region of the human X and have related genes or pseudogenes
   on the Y. STS, as well as CSF2RA, mapped to the tips of the short arm of
   the sheep X and Y (Xp and Yp), and STS and PRKX, as well as ANT3, mapped
   to the tips of the dog Xp and Y long arm (Yq). These locations within
   the X-Y pairing regions suggest that the regions containing all these
   human Xp22.3-Xpter genes are pseudoautosomal in dog and sheep. This
   supports the hypothesis that a larger pseudoautosomal region (PAR)
   shared by eutherian groups was disrupted by chromosomal rearrangements
   during primate evolution. The absence of STS and ANT3 from the sex
   chromosomes in two prosimian lemur species must therefore represent a
   recent translocation from their ancestral PAR, rather than retention of
   a smaller ancestral PAR shared by mouse.},

   or focal pallor of the myocardium with occasional marked pulmonary
   congestion. Necrotizing nonsuppurative myocarditis was consistently
   present. EMCV was isolated from only one of 54 feral rodents examined.
   No antibodies to EMCV were detected with a serum neutralization test in
   79 stored sera from a wide variety of zoo mammals. Titers of 1:16, 1:16,

Abstract = {Synthetic polypeptides encompassing the non-repeated regions of the
   circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of Plasmodium falciparum are very
   immunogenic in mice and are recognized by sera from donors living in
   regions where malaria is endemic, both in Africa and South America. Long
   polypeptides, encompassing the N- or C-terminal regions, have now been
   used to demonstrate peptide-specific T cells in donors living in an
   endemic area of Colombia. Although the N-terminal peptide (22-125) was
   recognized almost exclusively by donors from the endemic area, the
   patterns of recognition of the C-terminal peptide (289-390) in donors
   from endemic and non-endemic areas were similar and like the pattern
   with smaller peptides. The availability of the long polypeptides made it
   possible to compare T-cell responses to the non-repeated regions of the
   CSP with the presence of peptide-specific antibodies. No correlation was
   found and no antibodies were detected in donors from non-endemic
   regions.
   The long polypeptides also elicited strong antibody and T-cell responses
   in owl monkeys (Aotus lemurinus). The antibodies generated against the
   synthetic peptides in such monkeys also recognized sporozoites, the
   natural infective form of the parasite.
   The results emphasise the potential of the peptides tested as
   malaria-vaccine candidates. Not only are they recognized by humans at
   both the B- and T-cell level but they also elicit strong responses in
   monkeys and encompass several distinct T-cell epitopes, thus overcoming
   the limitations of specific, major-histocompatibility-complex
   restriction.},

   circular arrangement. Some of many circular forms can give fertile new

   (pre-species), additional chromosomal rearrangements were followed to
   produce karyotypes of existing Eulemur species, Due to these

Abstract = {In the present report we examine the composition and organization of the
   heterochromatic fraction of the genome, making use of cytochemical
   techniques, in a few species of primates of the genus Eulemur, a
   homogeneous group of lemuroidea from Madagascar. Among the species
   examined, Eulemur coronatus shows large blocks of heterochromatin
   distributed in nearly all the large metacentric chromosomes, in the
   large and small acrocentrics and in the microchromosomes. According to
   our measurements, such heterochromatin represents about 35\% of the
   genome of the species, probably originated through amplification
   processes after the splitting off of the species from the common trunk.
   It must be recalled that in the genus, Robertsonian fusion represented
   the major mechanism acting in chromosome evolution. E. coronatus
   heterochromatin shows peculiar FRET (fluorescence resonance energy
   transfer) characteristics both before and after dehistonisation
   protracted to the destruction of the nucleosomal structure. Its
   characteristic FRET pattern differs greatly from that of E. macaco,
   supposed to have a longer history of evolution. Furthermore,
   quantitative histochemical analysis and imaging measurements highlighted
   a peculiar structure of the E. coronatus heterochromatin. Finally. the
   comparison of the data obtained with in situ hybridization, with probes
   like (TTAGGG)n and with probes obtained after genomic digestion with
   some restriction enzymes (Bam HI, Hae III, Pvu II) on E. coronatus,
   macaco, rubriventer and fulvus chromosomes clearly showed that E.
   coronatus heterochromatin has a more heterogeneous composition than the
   other species. Overall the data obtained lead us to reconsider
   heterochromatin in terms of its potential evolutionary plasticity.},

Abstract = {We have examined and dated primate divergences by applying a newly
   established molecular/paleontological reference, the evolutionary
   separation between artiodactyls and cetaceans anchored at 60 million
   years before present (MYBP). Owing to the morphological transformations
   coinciding with the transition from terrestrial to aquatic (marine) life
   and the large body size of the animals (which makes their fossils easier
   to fmd), this reference can be defined, paleontologically, within much
   narrower time limits compared to any local primate calibration marker
   hitherto applied for dating hominoid divergences. Application of the
   artiodactyl/cetacean reference (A/C-60) suggests that hominoid
   divergences took place much earlier than has been concluded previously.
   According to a homogenous-rate model of sequence evolution, the primary
   hominoid divergence, i.e., that between the families Hylobatidae
   (gibbons) and Hominidae, was dated at approximate to 36 MYBP. The
   corresponding dating for the divergence between Pongo (orangutan) and
   Gorilla-Pan (chimpanzee) -Homo is approximate to 24.5 MYBP, that for
   Gorilla vs Home-Pan is approximate to 18 MYBP, and that for Homo vs Pan
   approximate to 13.5 MYBP. The split between Sumatran and Bornean
   orangutans was dated at approximate to 10.5 MYBP and that between the
   common and pygmy chimpanzees at approximate to 7 MYBP. Analyses of a
   single gene (cytochrome b) suggest that the divergence within the
   Catarrhini, i.e., between Hominoidea and Old World monkeys
   (Cercopithecoidea), took place >40 MYBP; that within the Anthropoidea,
   i.e., between Catarrhini and Platyrrhini (New World monkeys), >60 MYBP;
   and that between Anthropoidea and Prosimii (lemur), approximate to 80
   MYBP. These separation times are about two times more ancient than those
   applied previously as references for the dating of hominoid divergences.
   The present findings automatically imply a much slower evolution in
   hominoid DNA (both mitochondrial and nuclear) than commonly recognized.},

   Cercopithecidae, one Hylobatidae, one Lemuridae, three Pongidae) are
   reported. The primate species were housed in four separate galleries.
   Six faecal samples of each host species were subjected to coprological
   analysis. Fifteen parasite species were detected: 11 protozoa (Entamoeba
   coli, E. chattoni, E. hartmanni, lodamoeba butschlii, Endolimax nana,
   Giardia intestinalis, Chilomastix mesnilii, Enteromonas hominis,
   Trichomonas intestinalis, Balantidium coli, and Blastocystis hominis)
   and 4 helminths (Ancylostoma sp., Strongyloides fuelleborni,
   Strongyloides sp., and Trichuris trichiura). The results reveal certain
   parasitic similarities between host species housed in the same gallery;
   however, these primate species do not always carry identical parasite
   species.},

Abstract = {The four orders of eutherian mammals which are traditionally placed in
   the superorder Archonta {[}Chiroptera (microbats and megabats),
   Dermoptera (flying lemurs), Primates (primates), and Scandentia (tree
   shrews)] are among the best-studied taxa of their infraclass from both
   the molecular and morphological perspectives. Nevertheless, the ordinal
   relationships of archontans remain unresolved. While morphological
   studies favor their monophyly, molecular investigations do not. To
   evaluate these opposing conclusions, parsimony analyses were conducted
   with three separate sets of DNA sequences from both the nuclear and
   mitochondrial genomes and one file of morphological data for archontans
   and other eutherian mammals. Statistical tests of character support and
   ordinal branching pattern differences documented that the three sets of
   DNA sequences and their results were homogeneous and congruent, thereby
   allowing for the combination of these data into one large matrix for
   further phylogenetic analysis. In contrast, these same tests revealed
   that the combined sequence and morphological files and their topologies
   were in strong conflict. Archontan monophyly was supported by the
   morphological evidence, but this arrangement was strongly rejected by
   the combined DNA sequences that favored instead a grouping of
   Dermoptera, Primates, and Scandentia with Lagomorpha (rabbits) and
   Rodentia (rodents). Resolution of these significant differences will
   require further evaluations about the homologies and evolutionary
   properties of the molecular and morphological characters and about the
   appropriateness of the chosen phylogenetic methods, as well as the
   incorporation of new comparative data from both sources. (C) 1996

Title = {Evolution of the sweetness receptor in primates .2. Gustatory responses
   of non-human primates to nine compounds known to be sweet in man},
Journal = {CHEMICAL SENSES},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {21},
Number = {6},
Pages = {747-762},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The gustatory responses of nine compounds, namely glycine,
   D-phenylalanine, D-tryptophan, cyanosuosan, magapame, sucrononate,
   campame, cyclamate and superaspartame, all known as sweet in man, were
   studied in 41 species or subspecies of non-human primates, selected
   among Prosimii (Lemuridae and Lorisidae), Platyrrhini (Callitrichidae
   and Cebidae) and Catarrhini (Cercopithecidae, Hylobatidae and Pongidae).
   The first six compounds are generally sweet to all primates, which
   implies that they interact with the primate sweetness receptors
   essentially through constant recognition sites. Campame is sweet only to
   Cebidae and Catarrhini, cyclamate only to Catarrhini, superaspartame
   principally to Callitrichidae and Catarrhini, which implies that all
   these compounds interact with the receptors partly through variable
   recognition sites. From the present work, from other previous results
   (where notably it was observed that alitame is sweet to all primates,
   ampame only to Prosimii and Catarrhini, and aspartame only to
   Catarrhini), and from the multipoint attachment (MPA) theory of
   sweetness reception (as elaborated by Nofre and Tinti from a detailed
   study of structure-activity relationships of various sweeteners in man),
   it is inferred that the primate sweetness receptors are very likely made
   up of eight recognition sites, of which the first, second, third,
   fourth, seventh and eighth are constant, and the fifth and sixth
   variable. From these results and from the MPA theory, it is also
   inferred that the recognition sites of the primate sweetness receptors
   could be: Asp-1 or Glu-1, Lys-2, Asp-3 or Glu-3, Thr-4, X-5, X-6, Thr-7,
   Ser-8, where the variable recognition sites X-5 and X-6 would be: Ala-5
   and Ala-6 for Callitrichidae, Ser-5 and Ala-6 for Cebidae, Ala-5 and
   Thr-6 for Prosimii, and Thr-5 and Thr-6 for Catarrhini. By using
   Tupaiidae (tree shrews) as a reference outgroup and by means of other
   structural and functional molecular considerations, it appears that
   Callitrichidae have retained the most primitive receptor among the four
   types of primate receptors. The possible taxonomic and phylogenetic
   implications of these findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {The evolutionary innovations in Eutheria (Placentalia) are: loss of
   yolk, formation of outer trophoblast and attachment of maternal and
   embryonic tissues and circulation systems. Notogenesis and morphogenesis
   are running the programme common for Amniota, but the early development
   of the blastocyst and of extraembryonic membranes differs among the
   species. Therefore we can assume that the first placentals were not a
   homogenous,coup; if they were, they would have responded to innovations
   in the same way. To serve this issue the characters of fourteen pairs of
   early ontogenetic events were used for cladistic analysis. In each pair
   the event exists both in its primitive and derived state. The pairs 1 to
   6 refer to the blastocyst, the pairs 7 to 14 refer to embryonic
   nutrition. The placental mammals under study branch into two groups;
   decisive for the division is the speed of attachment of the blastocyst
   to the endometrium, on which the course of the other events is
   dependent. The first group includes: Pholidota, Carnivora, Artiodactyla,
   Cetacea, Perissodactyla, Proboscidea, Hyracoidea, Sirenia and
   Scandentia. The second group includes: Macroscelidea, Dermoptera,
   Chiroptera, Rodentia (incl. Lagomorpha) and Edentata. The orders
   Insectivora and Primates appear as diphyletic. From the order
   Insectivora, the superfamilies Soricoidea and Chrysochloroidea belong to
   the first group, the superfamilies Tenrecoidea and Erinacoidea belong to
   the second group. From the order Primates, the first group includes
   tribus Strepsirhini (i.e. prosimian superfamilies Lorisoidea and
   Lemuroidea). Tribus Haplorhini (prosimians of the superfamily Tarsoidea
   and suborder Anthropoidea), belongs to the second group.},

Abstract = {The aims of this study were to examine potential causes of variation in
   fundamental life-history traits and to illuminate their consequences for
   social behavior in the most primitive living primates. Specifically, I
   reexamined the claim that hfe histories of strepsirhine primates (lemurs
   and lorises) are metabolically constrained and tested the hypothesis
   that female social dominance, a behavioral idiosyncracy of Malagasy
   strepsirhines, is the result of unusually high energetic maternal
   investment in reproduction. I collected data on body mass, brain mass,
   metabolic rate, and fetal and postnatal litter growth rates for 21 lemur
   and 13 loris species to examine the relationship between maternal
   investment and the other variables after controlling for allometric and
   phylogenetic effects. I found that evolutionary changes in fetal growth
   rates, relative litter mass, and postnatal growth rates were associated
   with evolutionary changes in maternal mass but that neither brain size
   nor metabolic rate were independently correlated with variables
   reflecting maternal investment. Evolutionary changes in all three
   variables reflecting maternal investment were positively correlated with
   one another, however, indicating that they are coadapted, only broadly
   constrained by body size, and unconstrained by brain size and metabolic
   rate. Lemurs and lorises were found to have similar postnatal litter
   growth rates, which reflect the bulk of maternal reproductive
   investment, indicating that the energetic costs of reproduction did not
   figure prominently in the evolution of female dominance. The suggested
   unusual energetic stress of reproducing lemur females is further refuted
   by qualitative comparison with higher primates and other mammals. Thus,
   strepsirhine life histories are not narrowly constrained by nonadaptive
   forces and have no direct consequences for social relations between
   adult males and females.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to investigate the extent of convergence in
   four basic life history and socioecological traits among the primates of
   Africa, Asia, South America and Madagascar. The convergence hypothesis
   predicts that similar abiotic conditions should result in similar
   adaptations in independent taxa. Because primates offer a unique
   opportunity among mammals to examine adaptations of independent groups
   to tropical environments, we collected information on body mass,
   activity pattern, diet and group size from all genera for quantitative
   rests of this hypothesis. We revealed a number of qualitative and
   quantitative differences among the four primate groups, indicating a
   lack of convergence in these basic aspects of life history and
   socio-ecology. Our analyses demonstrated that New World primates are on
   average significantly smaller than primates in other regions and
   characterized by a lack of species larger than about 10 kg. Madagascar
   harbours significantly more nocturnal species than the other regions and
   is home to all but one of the primates with irregular bursts of
   activity. Asia is the only region with strictly faunivorous primates,
   but lacks primarily gummivorous ones. The Neotropics are characterized
   by the absence of primarily folivorous primates. Solitary species are
   not represented in the New World, whereas solitary and pair-living
   species make up the majority of Malagasy primates. Lemurs live in
   significantly smaller groups than other primates, even after controlling
   for differences in body size. The lack of convergence among the major
   primate groups is neither primarily due to phylogenetic constraints as a
   result of founder effects, nor can it be sufficiently explained as a
   passive consequence of body size differences. However, because the role
   of adaptive forces, such as interspecific competition, predation or
   phenology in shaping the observed differences is largely unexplored, we
   conclude that it is premature to discard the convergence hypothesis
   without further rests. (C) 1996 The Linnean Society of London},

Abstract = {We assessed effects of selective logging of rain forest upon a diverse
   assemblage of folivorous (leaf-eating) marsupials in tropical
   Queensland, Australia. Spotlighting censuses of mammal populations were
   conducted for I-yr periods before logging (1886/87) and 3 yr after
   logging (1993/94), on a 150-ha sire in which an average of 8-10 trees/ha
   (50-55 m(3)/ha) were extracted. Two formerly logged `'reference sites''
   were censused concurrently to assess effects of sampling variation and
   between-year population fluctuations on census results.
   Lemuroid ringtail possums (Hemibelideus lemuroides) declined markedly in
   logged forest, while three other possums (Pseudocheirops archeri,
   Trichosuras vulpecula, Pseudocheirus herbertensis) and a tree-kangaroo
   (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) did not differ significantly between pre- and
   pen-logging censuses. Folivores char are highly dependent upon primary
   forest clearly are most vulnerable to logging. The magnitude and
   duration of logging impacts on arboreal mammal populations is probably
   strongly affected by the level of forest structural damage incurred
   during logging operations. We suggest that ecological and behavioral
   traits such as the degree of arboreality, diet, denning requirements and
   territorial behavior influenced the responses of these marsupials to
   logging.},

Title = {New pedal remains of Megaladapis and their functional significance},

Year = {1996},
Volume = {100},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {New remains of Megaladapis from the caves within the Ankarana Range of
   northern Madagascar and the cave site of Ankilitelo near Toliara in
   southwestern Madagascar add considerably to the present sample of pedal
   remains for this genus, Here we describe and analyze the new pedal
   material and discuss the function of the Megaladapis foot in terms of
   positional behavior and substrate use. The northern specimens belong to
   the M. madagascariensis/M. grandidieri group in terms of size and
   morphology, whereas the new southwestern fossils are assigned to M.
   madagascariensis. The new specimens demonstrate that the small and
   intermediate sized M. madagascariensis and M. grandidieri were very
   similar in anatomy and inferred locomotor function, findings that also
   support the prior suggestion that they belong to a single widespread
   subgenus (Megaladapis). The new fossils provide the first examples of
   many pedal elements and present the first opportunity to analyze the
   whole pedal complex from associated remains.
   The foot of Megaladapis is distinctive among primates in numerous
   features, Intrinsic proportions of the hindlimb indicate that the foot
   is relatively longer than that of any other primate. The first complete
   calcanei reveal a large and highly modified hindfoot. The calcaneus is
   reduced distally, indicating an emphasis on climbing over leaping or
   quadrupedal walking and running. Proximally, a large, medially directed
   calcaneal tuberosity; suggests both a strong inversion component to
   plantarflexion and a well-developed abductor mechanism and recalls the
   calcaneal morphology of the larger lorisines in some respects. Talar
   shape is consistent with considerable tibial rotation during
   plantarflexion and dorsiflexion. The subtalar joint is designed to
   emphasize supination/pronation and medial/lateral rotation over
   proximodistal translation. The distal tarsals are extremely reduced in
   length, and they form a high transverse arch and a serial tarsus; this
   configuration promotes inversion/eversion at the transverse tarsal
   joint. The phalanges are long and moderately curved, and the hallux is
   very long, robust, and abducted.
   Pedal morphology suggests that Megaladapis (subgenus Megaladapis) was
   well adapted to exploit an arboreal environment, The grasping mechanism
   of Megaladapis is an extreme modification of the prosimian condition,
   emphasizing a highly inverted set, mobility in rotation, and a powerful
   abduction/`flexion type grasp using the large hallux and the lateral
   abductor musculature. Such a mechanism insures a secure grasp regardless
   of the position of the hindlimb or the substrate. These pedal design
   features contrast with the grasping strategy seen in the highly arboreal
   palaeopropithecids (or `'sloth lemurs''), a group that reduces and
   modifies the hindfoot, culminating in Palaeopropithecus, and emphasizes
   extrinsic digital flexors in a more hooklike mechanism. Much less is
   known of M. (Peloriadapis) edwardsi. The larger body size, more
   gorilla-like talar articular morphology, and anatomy of the proximal
   fifth metatarsal suggest that this species may have been more
   terrestrial than the smaller forms, but other aspects of pedal
   morphology suggest it also exploited arboreal habitats. (C) 1996

Abstract = {The eucalypt forests of temperate eastern Australia contrast with many
   forests in tropical Australia, Asia, Africa and Central America in terms
   of degrees of sclerophylly, concentrations of nutrients in foliage,
   types and amounts of chemical challenges posed for herbivores, and the
   range of alternatives to foliage as food. Comparisons between digestive
   strategies employed by arboreal herbivorous marsupials and primates
   inhabiting these forests reveal several trends: (i) foregut-fermenters
   occur only in tropical and sub-tropical forests, whereas caecum and
   caecum-colon fermenters occur in both temperate eucalypt and the
   tropical forests; (ii) the arboreal marsupials and primates (koalas,
   greater gliders, ringtail possums and sportive lemurs) that are the most
   folivorous are caecum or caecum-colon fermenters with colonic
   specializations for selective retention of small particles of digesta;
   (iii) no caecum or caecum- colon fermenters lacking colonic separation
   mechanisms achieve consistently high degrees of folivory; (iv) even the
   most folivorous foregut-fermenting arboreal marsupials (tree kangaroos)
   of primates (colobus monkeys) include a substantial proportion of
   high-quality components (fruits or seeds) in their diet. Caecum or
   caecum-colon fermentation with colonic separation is postulated to be
   essential for a high degree of folivory in small mammals because it
   offsets potential limits on intake of high-fibre food and minimizes
   losses of faecal nitrogen that otherwise would be prohibitive. This
   digestive strategy is common among folivores in eucalypt forests because
   the low abundance of large seeds and fleshy fruits limits
   folivory-frugivory and folivory-granivory. Foregut fermentation
   employing a sacciform/tubiform forestomach (as in tree kangaroos and
   colobus monkeys) is postulated to be optimal for mixed leaf/fruit and
   leaf/seed diets that are available in many tropical forests, assuming it
   allows high-fibre meals to be retained for microbial fermentation while
   permitting low-fibre meals to pass rapidly to the hindstomach for
   acid/enzymic digestion. However, foregut fermentation appears
   innappropriate for either primary frugivory or exclusive folivory due to
   the inefficiency of microbial digestion of simple sugars and constraints
   on microbial fermentation as a primary energy source for small mammals.},

Abstract = {The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a baculovirus recombinant
   polypeptide based on the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein
   1 (MSP-1) has been evaluated in Aotus lemurinus griseimembra monkeys.
   The MSP-1-based polypeptide, BVp42, corresponds to the 42-kDa C-terminal
   processing fragment of the precursor molecule, Immunization of Aotus
   monkeys,vith BVpl2 in complete Freund's adjuvant resulted in high
   antibody titers against the immunogen as well as parasite MSP-1. Fine
   specificity studies indicated that major epitopes recognized by these
   antibodies localize to conserved determinants of the 19-kDa C-terminal
   fragment derived from cleavage of the 42-kDa processing fragment,
   Effective priming of MSP-1-specific T cells was also demonstrated in
   lymphocyte proliferation assays, All three Aotus monkeys immunized with
   BVp42 in complete Freund's adjuvant showed evidence of protection
   against blood-stage challenge with P. falciparum. Two animals were
   completely protected, with only one parasite being detected in thick
   blood films on a single day after infection. The third animal had a
   modified course of infection, controlling its parasite infection to
   levels below detection by thick blood smears for an extended period in
   comparison with adjuvant control animals, All vaccinated, protected
   Aotus monkeys produced antibodies which inhibited in vitro parasite
   growth, indicating that this assay may be a useful correlate of
   protective immunity and that immunity induced by BVp42 immunization is
   mediated, at least in part, by a direct effect of antibodies against the
   MSP-1 C-terminal region. The high level of protection obtained in these
   studies supports further development of BVp42 as a candidate malaria
   vaccine.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I provide data on the possible effects of group size and
   seasonal changes in food availability on the activity and habitat use
   patterns of two species of prosimian primate: the rufous lemur (Eulemur
   fulvus rufus) and the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer). General
   and subtle seasonal differences were observed between lemur species in
   (1) group size and composition, (2) activity profiles, and (3) habitat
   use. Rufous lemur groups were larger (mean = 8 individuals) and
   contained more adults than red-bellied lemur groups (mean = 3
   individuals). The overall degree and distribution of diurnal activity
   differed between lemur species and varied within species with seasonal
   changes in food availability. In general, rufous lemurs traveled more
   often than red-bellied lemurs. During food scarcity, both species
   increased the amount of time spent feeding, although peak feeding and
   traveling times differed. Both species also preferred horizontal
   substrates; however, during food scarcity, red-bellied lemurs used
   terminal branches more often while feeding than rufous lemurs. In
   addition, red-bellied lemurs used the lower middle story forest and
   rested in taller, upper canopy trees more often than rufous lemurs.
   Differences in activity and habitat use patterns between lemur species
   were more related to seasonal changes in food availability than overall
   differences in group size. These behavioral patterns may represent
   different strategies used by each lemur species to avoid directly
   competing for similar resources during times of food scarcity. (C) 1996

Abstract = {It is generally accepted that most taxa living today in Madagascar came
   from Africa. But new paleogeographic results suggest another geographic
   origin for some of the Malagasy fauna. By the end of the Cretaceous,
   India was connected to Asia by a land route, although it was still in a
   southern position at that time. Moreover, India was still close to
   Madagascar, and the Seychelles Plateau intervened between these two
   plates, enabling exchange between them. Such a connection could have
   permitted certain groups such as <<Iguanidae>> (Lacertilia) and Boinae
   (Serpentes) to migrate to Madagascar from Laurasia. These groups, which
   are present today in Madagascar but are lacking in Laurasia and Africa,
   had reached the former by the end of the Cretaceous and the early
   Tertiary. Assuming that the absence of fossils of these groups in Africa
   does not represent a gap in the paleontological record, it is
   hypothesized that iguanids and boines reached Madagascar from Laurasia
   via an Indian route. Other groups (perhaps including lemurs, the closest
   relatives of which were Laurasian) may have reached Madagascar in a
   similar manner. This hypothesis is not incompatible with the existence
   of exchanges between Madagascar and Africa.},

Abstract = {Despite the continuous close proximity of Madagascar to Africa since its
   separation from the continent ca. 165 MYA, the Malagasy flora exhibits a
   remarkably high affinity with the Indo-autralo-malesian floras far to
   the east. Such phytogeographic connections are especially prevalent
   among eastern humid forest taxa, and represent both ancient vicariance
   that has resulted in relictual (Cretaceous) Gondwanan disjunctions, as
   well as continuous dispersal events across the Indian Ocean. Three major
   patterns of dispersal/vicariance modality can be identified: 1)

Abstract = {The separation of Madagascar from the African mainland is generally
   thought to have substantially predated the earliest known euprimates in
   Africa and the northern continents. There now seems little alternative
   to the implantation of primates on Madagascar by the << sweepstakes >>
   route: rafting. The width of the Mozambique Channel even in the late
   Cretaceous period seems to have been such that survival of sufficient
   founders to establish a viable population requires explanation. In the
   absence of fossil evidence of Malagasy lemurs from the Eocene and
   earlier, we must base our reconstruction of the early adaptive radiation
   on the island from neontology. The radiation of living strepsirhine
   primates on Madagascar is distinctly different from those on mainland
   Africa, and in East and S.E. Asia. While the Malagasy radiation is more
   diverse, it curiously appears to lack the small, saltatory animalivores
   occupying the lowest strata of primary forest, which are found today in
   large parts of Africa and S.E. Asia, and which have close resemblance to
   one of the domininant morphotypes among the Eocene northern-continent
   primate radiations. The most specialized leapers found on Madagascar are
   much larger, and at least partially folivorous. Moreover, they include
   species which have amongst the lowest metabolic rates among placental
   mammals. This paradox suggests that low metabolic rates, and the
   seasonal torpor which is]present in many of the mouse and dwarf lemurs,
   may have been key to the implantation of the lemurs on Madagascar.
   Whether or not this is so, the combination of low metabolic rates, and a
   frugivorous/folivorous diet with the hindlimb dominated locomotion which
   characterizes the whole order, has closely constrained the nature of the
   radiation, not only of the living lemurs, but their relatives among the
   subfossil lemurs.},

Abstract = {Humans, apes and Old World monkeys (catarrhines) differ from other
   mammals in that they do not synthesize alpha-galactosyl epitopes (Gal
   alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc-R) on cell surface glycoprotein and
   glycolipid molecules. In contrast these primates produce large amounts
   of a natural antibody. anti-Gal, which interacts specifically with
   alpha-galactosyl epitopes. It is suggested that these differences
   between catarrhines and other mammals are the result of a major
   evolutionary selective process which occurred in ancestral Old World
   primates during the Miocene and which led to the inactivation of the
   alpha 1,3galactosyl-transferase gene. In New World monkeys, prosimians
   (lemurs) and non-primate mammals this gene codes for the enzyme
   synthesizing alpha-galactosyl epitopes. The potential causes for this
   gene inactivation, the possible relationship of this genetic event to
   the fossil record and some of the clinical outcomes of this evolutionary
   event are discussed. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited},

Abstract = {The evolutionary history and differentiation of the owl or night monkeys
   (Aotus), remain poorly resolved. Variation in pelage and skeletal
   morphology is relatively minor across their broad range, but cytogenetic
   studies have revealed that at least 12 karyotypically distinct forms
   exist, with 2N chromosome numbers ranging from 46 to 58. We obtained DNA
   samples from three putative species-A. lemurinus, A. nancymae, and A.
   azarae-and five karyotypes (I, II, III, IV, and VI), amplified the
   mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene (COII) via PCR and
   sequenced ii. Comparisons of the sequences indicate relatively high
   levels of sequence divergence among the putative species (4.3 to 6.3\%),
   and suggest that the taxa are genetically quite distinct and have likely
   experienced extended periods of isolated evolution. The levels of COII
   divergence represent approximately one-third of the levels found between
   divergent platyrrhine genera, such as Aotus, Saimiri and Callimico.
   Using estimates of substitution rates of COII-evolution in hominoid
   primates, the estimated date of divergence for the Aotus COII sequences
   is 3.6 million years. The Aotus COII data support the existence of
   multiple species of Aotus, with origins predating late Pleistocene
   climatic events. Although A. nancymae and A. azarae both live south of
   the Amazon River and have been considered members of the same species
   group, phylogenetic analysis of the COII sequences does not support a
   close relationship between them.},

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Pages = {326-336},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {We present a direct test of the long-standing hypothesis that food
   competition limits primate group size. Group size is a critical social
   variable because it constrains most other aspects of social
   organization. We develop a simple population-specific index of indirect
   feeding competition based on daily foraging costs. This index explains
   nearly two-thirds of between-population variation in mean group sizes of
   mostly fruit-eating (but not of mostly leaf-eating) primates. Group size
   is also significantly related to body size and terrestriality (or use of
   open country), which are suspected correlates of predation risk,
   although feeding competition remains an important predictor of group
   size even when these correlates are controlled. Phylogeny also appears
   to be important: the differences between observed mean population group
   sizes and those predicted using ecological factors are most positive for
   the Old World monkeys and most negative for the lemuroid in our sample.
   The weak relationship between group size and feeding competition found
   for folivorous species may be explained either by the energetic
   constraints of a leafy diet or by limits to group size imposed by
   infanticide as a habitual male reproductive strategy.},

Abstract = {The evolution of ADP-ribosyltransferase (NAD(+)) pseudogene 1 (ADPRTP1)
   was studied among higher primates. When the human pseudogene was used to
   probe genomic DNA from chimpanzee, gorilla, macaque, howler monkey and
   lemur, a fragment from gorilla produced the most intense hybridization
   signal. The resultant hybridization pattern indicated a modified
   pseudogene structure in these primates relative to the human and gorilla
   loci. Sequence comparison of this new DNA locus (ADPRTP1 and surrounding
   retroposons) showed a nucleotide (nt) identity of 98.13\% (over 5.8 kb)
   between the genomic regions of human and gorilla, A unique duplicated
   region of 30 base pairs (bp) was found in gorilla ADPRTP1, separate from
   the duplicated region (193 bp) responsible for the restriction-fragment
   length polymorphism (RFLP) previously reported in humans, and which
   appeared to represent a marker for a predisposition to cancer. An
   endogenous pol (gene encoding polymerase) related element that flanked
   the human pseudogene was used as a probe to identify a fragment from
   this retroviral family in New World monkeys. Altogether, analysis of
   these retroposons will provide an opportunity for future studies on the

Abstract = {The presence of significant numbers of intestinal methanogens among
   vertebrates does neither depend on elaborated morphological structures
   nor on predominantly plant-based diets. Phylogenetic rather than dietary
   restrictions limit the occurrence of methanogenic bacteria also in the
   hindguts of primates. The Old-World monkeys are methanogenic - with the
   only exceptions of Cheirogaleid lemurs and bush-babies. In contrast,
   among New World monkeys the lack of intestinal methanogens is observed
   frequently in capuchins and marmosets. Since the absence of methanogens
   does not parallel distinct morphological, physiological, or ethological
   characteristics, it is likely that methanogenesis depends on a
   hereditary predisposition.
   In humans, methane-producers account for approximately 50 \% of the
   European populations. In this study, 56 individuals belonging to 5
   families were studied for the occurrence of methane in the breath. The
   results of this screen are compatible with the assumption that the trait
   `'methane emission'' segregates as an autosomal, dominant character. Our
   findings suggest a high specificity of the symbiosis between primates
   and methanogenic bacteria. Therefore, the persistence of significant
   numbers of methanogens in the hindgut might be facilitated by a specific
   receptor for methanogenic bacteria.},

Abstract = {Four young (2 to 4-year-old) and four aged (9 to 10-year-old) grey mouse
   lemurs (Micro-cebus murinus) were given a simple visual discrimination
   task, and a delayed response visual discrimination task with variable
   retention delay. The response to the test is a motor one, that consists
   of choosing one out of lour corridors of an apparatus based upon the
   degree of illumination. The aged animals did not show any learning
   deficiency, and were capable of memorizing the task for several months.
   However, they were more sensitive to the length of the delay in the
   delayed response task than the young animals. It is, therefore, possible
   to argue that the memory for recent stimulus events is affected during
   aging. These results corroborate those obtained in other primates, and
   demonstrate the usefulness of the grey mouse lemur as a new animal model
   for analyzing aging.},

Abstract = {Proton magnetic resonance microscopy of biological systems at a field
   strength 11.7T (500 MHz resonance frequency) is examined from the point
   of view of signal-to-noise and resolution. Results from three imaging
   schemes are discussed. These are: (1) spin warp spin echo (SW-SE); (2)
   projection reconstruction using free induction signals (PR-FID); and (3)
   constant time with free induction decay signals (CT-FID). The point
   spread functions for the various factors that contribute to resolution
   in each scheme are examined. The SW-SE method meets most of the
   challenges in biological imaging and provides T-2 contrast. CT-FID is a
   useful method for imaging of biological solids with short T-2{*} but
   long data collection times limits its usefulness for in vivo imaging. In
   comparison, PR-FID is shown to be capable of fast imaging using small
   gradients. Consequently, diffusion effects can be reduced. Using images
   of the head of a mouse lemur we conclude that a signal-to-noise ratio of
   5 is adequate to extract useful neuro-anatomical details in T-2-weighted
   images. We emphasize the importance of isotropically resolved
   three-dimensional imaging for examination of anatomical structures,
   developing cellular patterns, and connectivity relationships in
   biological systems.},

Abstract = {Bamboo has been inferred to have comprised a significant portion of the

   occlusal microwear on the teeth of this Pleistocene ape is compared with
   that on the molars of two extant bamboo specialists, Hapalemur griseus
   (the gentle lemur) and Ailuropoda melanoleuca (the giant panda). Bamboo
   feeding does not appear to produce a consistent pattern of microwear in
   pandas and lemurs. Their wear fabrics may vary because of differences in
   tooth and body size, dissimilar dental morphologies and concomitant
   differences in masticatory dynamics, the utilization of different plant
   parts by the two taxa, and/or differences in oral food preparation prior
   to mastication. Because extant bamboo specialists exhibit dissimilar
   microwear patterns, tooth wear of G. blacki provides little direct
   evidence for bamboo feeding. Compared to the dental microwear of living
   anthropoids, however, Gigantopithecus is intermediate between folivorous
   forms and hard-object specialists, and is most similar to Pan
   troglodytes, a predominantly frugivorous species.},

Abstract = {For this paper, we sampled a fenced and an unprotected portion of a dry
   gallery forest (the Beza Mahafaly Reserve) in southwestern Madagascar
   for structure and floristic composition. Seedling plots were also
   sampled to assess invasion and regeneration. A total of 923 plants
   greater-than-or-equal-to 2.5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were
   censused in 25 transects. Sixty-nine species and 43 genera were
   represented. In plant density, diversity, and size classes of
   individuals, the forest is similar to many continental tropical dry
   forests in Africa and the Neotropics. Over 80 percent of those species
   identified were native, as were 26 percent of the genera. Unlike many
   insular forests, Beza Mahafaly is not being invaded by fast-growing
   exotic species. There were no noticable differences in density,
   diversity, size classes, or proportion of native species between
   transects within and outside of the protected reserve.
   Two distinct microhabitats were noticed. Individual plants were more
   dense on `'drier'' soils; whereas, large trees greater-than-or-equal-to
   25 cm DBH were over twice as frequent on `'wetter'' soils. The floristic
   composition also differed, with only two species of tree, Tamarindus
   indica and Azima tetracantha, being common to both habitats. The
   distribution and density of lemur populations within the forest appear
   to be directly related to microhabitat differences.},

Abstract = {Microsatellites are tandem repeats of short sequences elements (most
   often CA repeats) interspersed in many genomes and which frequently show
   multiallele polymorphism. They have proved invaluable for genomic
   mapping in man and other species and may be used for evolutionary
   studies provided that the available primers can be used in different
   species. The dystrophin gene, which show high sequence conservation
   between man, rodents and chicken contains such polymorphic CA repeats.
   Using the oligonucleotides primers developed for testing the polymorphic
   CA repeat of the 3' untranslated region of the dystrophin gene in man,
   we achieved the amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the
   analogous region in five non human primates species (Pan troglodytes,
   Gorilla, gorilla, Macaca tonkeana, Macaca fascicularis, Lemur fulvus).
   All were proved to posses the CA repeat while intraspecies variations of
   the microsatellite length was observed in chimpanzees, gorilla and
   tonkean macaques. As it was demonstrated by sequencing, these length
   variations depend on the number of CA repeats in the microsatellite.},

Abstract = {As part of a wider study on the molecular evolution of
   alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase 1 (AGT1) intracellular
   compartmentalization, we have determined the subcellular distribution of
   immunoreactive AGT1, using postembedding protein A-gold immunoelectron
   microscopy, in the livers of various members of the classes Mammalia,
   Aves, and Amphibia. As far as organellar distribution is concerned,
   three categories could be distinguished. In members of the first
   category (type I), all, or nearly all, of the immunoreactive AGT1 was
   concentrated within the peroxisomes. In the second category (type II),
   AGT1 was found more evenly distributed in both peroxisomes and
   mitochondria. In the third category (type III), AGT1 was localized
   mainly within the mitochondria with much lower, but widely variable,
   amounts in the peroxisomes. Type I animals include the human, two great
   apes (gorilla, orangutan), two Old World monkeys (anubis baboon,
   japanese maraque), a New World monkey (white faced Saki monkey), a
   lagomorph (European rabbit), a bat (Seba's short tailed fruit bat), two
   caviomorph rodents (guinea pig, orange-rumped agouti), and two
   Australian marsupials (koala, Bennett's wallaby). Type II animals
   include two New World monkeys (common marmoset, cotton-top tamarin),
   three prosimians (brown lemur, fat-tailed dwarf Lemur, pygmy slow
   loris), five rodents (a hybrid crested porcupine, Colombian ground
   squirrel, laboratory rat, laboratory mouse, golden hamster), an American
   marsupial (grey short-tailed opossum), and a bird (raven). Type III
   animals include the large tree shrew, three insectivores (common
   Eurasian mole, European hedgehog, house shrew), four carnivores
   (domestic cat, ocelot, domestic dog, polecat ferret), and an amphibian
   (common frog). In addition to these categories, some animals (e.g.
   guinea pig, common frog) possessed significant amounts of cytosolic
   AGT1. Whereas the subcellular distribution of AGT1 in some orders (e. g.
   Insectivora and Carnivora) did not appear to vary markedly between the
   different members, in other orders (e.g. Primates, Rodentia and
   Marsupialia) it fluctuated widely between the different species.
   Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the subcellular distribution of
   AGT1 has changed radically on numerous occasions during the evolution of
   mammals. The new observations presented in this paper are compatible
   with our previous demonstration of a relationship between AGT1
   subcellular distribution and either present or putative ancestral
   dietary habit, and our previous suggestion that the molecular evolution
   of the AGT gene has been markedly influenced by dietary selection
   pressure.},

Abstract = {Expression of the anthropoid (simian) gamma gene in fetal life contrasts
   with the exclusively embryonic expression pattern of the gamma-like
   genes of other eutherian mammals. To elucidate the factors responsible
   for this change in expression pattern, we utilized a strategy called
   differential phylogenetic footprinting (DPF). This strategy entails the
   following: (a) identification, within regulatory regions, of the gamma
   promoter, of individual nucleotides that differ between human (fetal
   expression), and galago (embryonic expression) gamma genes, (b) analysis
   of the effect of these nucleotide differences on the binding of nuclear
   proteins to human and galago sequences, and (c) assessment of the
   functional consequences of these binding changes in expression assays.
   The DPF analysis revealed several proteins that bind upstream from the
   CCAAT motif in the galago gamma promoter but do not bind to the
   corresponding region of the human gamma promoter. In transfection
   assays, binding of these proteins is associated with erythroid-specific
   repression of promoter strength. Binding sites for these proteins also
   occur near the CCAAT box of other embryonically expressed genes,
   including rabbit, mouse, and dwarf lemur gamma genes and the human
   epsilon globin gene. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that
   sequence changes near the proximal CCAAT box in the ancestral simian
   gamma gene may have facilitated a novel expression pattern by reducing
   the binding of repressors that act in the fetal stage.},

Abstract = {MHC class II genes of the DRB family were partially sequenced from 10
   individuals representing six species of prosimians: Galago senegalensis,
   G. moholi, Otolemur garnettii, Loris tardigradus, Petterus (Lemur)
   fulvus, and Lemur catta. Altogether, 41 different genes were discerned,
   all distinct from genes identified previously. Comparative analysis of
   the sequences has led to the following conclusions. First, the DRB loci
   present in human populations diverged from one another before the
   divergence of prosimian and anthropoid primates. Second, major allelic
   lineages of the DRB1 locus, such as DRB1{*}03 (DRB1{*}13) and DRB1{*}04,
   were established more than 85 million years ago. Third, the DRB6 gene
   was inactivated before the separation of prosimians and anthropoids, and
   has remained a pseudogene for more than 85 million years. Fourth, the
   primate DRB region is structurally and functionally unstable. In Lemur
   catta, for example, all DRB genes have apparently been lost and their
   function taken over by DOB and/or DPB genes. DRB genes are, however,
   present in a related species, Petterus (Lemur) fulvus. Fifth, the
   prosimian DRB3 genes are all inactive; their function seems to have been
   taken over by new genes. Sixth, several of the prosimian DRB genes and
   pseudogenes have recently been duplicated. In Otolemur garnetti, for
   example, one chromosome carries at least three copies of the DRB3
   pseudogene.},

Volume = {94},

Abstract = {Evidence from DNA sequences on the phylogenetic systematics of primates
   is congruent with the evidence from morphology in grouping
   Cercopithecoidea (Old World monkeys) and Hominoidea (apes and humans)
   into Catarrhini, Catarrhini and Platyrrhini (ceboids or New World
   monkeys) into Anthropoidea, Lemuriformes and Lorisiformes into
   Strepsirhini, and Anthropoidea, Tarsioidea, and Strepsirhini into
   Primates. With regard to the problematic relationships of Tarsioidea,
   DNA sequences group it with Anthropoidea into Haplorhini. In addition,
   the DNA evidence favors retaining Cheirogaleidae within Lemuriformes in
   contrast to some morphological studies that favor placing Cheirogaleids
   in Lorisiformes. While parsimony analysis of the present DNA sequence
   data provides only modest support for Haplorhini as a monophyletic
   taxon, it provides very strong support for Hominoidea, Catarrhini,
   Anthropoidea, and Strepsirhini as monophyletic taxa. The parsimony DNA
   evidence also rejects the hypothesis that megabats are the sister group
   of either Primates or Dermoptera (flying lemur) or a Primate-Dermoptera
   clade and instead strongly supports the monophyly of Chiroptera, with
   megabats grouping with microbats at considerable distance from Primates.
   In contrast to the confused morphological picture of sister group
   relationships within Hominoidea, orthologous noncoding DNA sequences
   (spanning alignments involving as many as 20,000 base positions) now
   provide by the parsimony criterion highly significant evidence for the
   sister group relationships defined by a cladistic classification that
   groups the lineages to all extant hominoids into family Hominidae,
   divides this ape family into subfamilies Hylobatinae (gibbons) and
   Homininae, divides Homininae into tribes Pongini (orangutans) and
   Hominini, and divides Hominini into subtribes Gorillina (gorillas) and
   Hominina (humans and chimpanzees). A likelihood analysis of the largest
   body of these noncoding orthologues and counts of putative
   synapomorphies using the full range of sequence data from mitochondrial
   and nuclear genomes also find that humans and chimpanzees share the
   longest common ancestry. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The effects of age on the activities of the two enzymes of the
   glutathione redox cycle, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione
   reductase, were studied in lenses of primates. Three species were Old
   World simians (orangutan, olive baboon and pigtail monkey) and two were
   prosimians (galago and mouse lemur).
   Glutathione peroxidase activity of the olive baboon lens increased
   steadily with age while that of the pigtail monkey increased during the
   first 6-8 years and then plateaued. Enzyme activity in the orangutan
   increased steadily from 9 months to 28 years. This enzyme activity
   decreased steadily in the galago but increased only slightly in the
   mouse lemur lens.
   The lenticular glutathione reductase activity profiles showed decreases
   with age for all three simian species. Enzyme activity in the galago
   decreased gradually from birth to the age of 16.5 years. The enzyme
   activity values of the mouse lemur lens did not yield a comprehensible
   pattern.
   Lens weight increased with age in all five primate species, particularly
   in the infant and juvenile years and leveled off in adulthood.
   The current investigation demonstrated that the responses of these
   enzyme activities to aging were very different in Old World simians as
   compared to prosimians. These studies are consistent with earlier enzyme
   activity and thermolability data and are indicative of probable critical
   differences in the primary structures of the enzymes between the two
   primate groups.},

Abstract = {We examined the nucleotide and amino acid sequence variation of the

   hominoids, 8 Old World monkeys, 2 New World monkeys, 2 tarsiers, 7
   lemuriforms, 2 lorisiforms). Marginal support was found for three
   phylogenetic conclusions: (1) sister-group relationship between tarsiers
   and a monkey/ape clade, (2) placement of the aye-aye (Daubentonia)
   sister to all other strepsirhine primates, and (3) rejection of a
   sister-group relationship of dwarf lemurs (i.e., Cheirogaleus) with
   lorisiform primates. Stronger support was found for a sister-group
   relationship between the ring-tail lemur (Lemur catta) and the gentle
   lemurs (Hapalemur). In congruence with previous studies on COII, we
   found that the monkeys and apes have undergone a nearly two-fold
   increase in the rate of amino acid replacement relative to other
   primates. Although functionally important amino acids are generally
   conserved among all primates, the acceleration in amino acid
   replacements in higher primates is associated with increased variation
   in the amino terminal end of the protein. Additionally, the replacement
   of two carboxyl-bearing residues (glutamate and aspartate) at positions
   114 and 115 may provide a partial explanation for the poor enzyme
   kinetics in cross-reactions between the cytochromes c and cytochrome c

Title = {SERRATUS VENTRALIS FUNCTION IN VERVET MONKEYS (CERCOPITHECUS-AETHIOPS) -
   ARE PRIMATE QUADRUPEDS UNIQUE},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},

Abstract = {The serratus ventralis in mammals is a fan-shaped scapulo-thoracic
   muscle that is believed by most morphologists both to support body
   weight and to rotate the scapula during quadrupedal locomotion.
   Electromyographic studies of this muscle in cats, dogs and opossums
   confirm the dual supportive and rotatory roles of the serratus
   ventralis. Although this muscle has been studied in several primate
   species, the concentration on arboreal locomotion has resulted in an
   inadequate data set to permit direct comparisons to non-primate
   terrestrial quadrupeds. In order to provide a more comparable data set,
   we examined cranial, mid- and caudal thoracic regions of the serratus
   ventralis during terrestrial quadrupedalism in the vervet monkey,
   Cercopithecus aethiops. Our results indicate that the serratus ventralis
   does support the body during the stance phase of quadrupedalism in this
   primate. However, unlike several non-primate mammals, it plays a
   relatively insignificant rotatory role during swing phase.
   Additional published and unpublished data on Lemur, Alouatta, Ateles and
   Pan indicate a pattern of serratus ventralis recruitment similar to that
   of the vervet during terrestrial quadrupedalism. However, the
   mid-thoracic digitations of serratus ventralis are recruited during
   swing phase of quadrupedalism on a branch. We suggest that serratus
   ventralis activity during swing phase will cause ventral displacement of
   the scapula that has the potential for interfering with the ability of
   the forelimb to clear the substratum. The occurrence of swing phase
   activity in serratus ventralis during branch quadrupedalism reflects
   reduced constraints on forelimb clearance since the hand can be allowed
   to pass laterally along the bough.
   The potential negative effect of ventral girdle displacement may also
   explain the contrast in serratus ventralis recruitment between primates
   and non-primates during swing phase of terrestrial quadrupedalism.
   Primates are known to have uniquely long stride lengths relative to
   non-primate mammals owing in part to their highly protracted arm
   position at touchdown. Ventral displacement of the scapula caused by
   swing phase recruitment of serratus ventralis could cause premature
   touchdown that would hinder proper hand placement in primates. Such
   displacement is more tolerable in non-primate mammals owing to their
   highly retracted arm position throughout swing phase.
   The unique de-emphasis on the serratus ventralis during swing phase of
   terrestrial quadrupedalism in primates does not indicate a lack of
   involvement of this muscle in scapular rotation. Data on muscle activity
   during reaching behaviours demonstrates a major contribution by the
   serratus ventralis to scapular rotation when it is combined with
   scapular protraction, thus providing further support for the importance
   of this muscle in arm-raising activities in primates.},

Abstract = {Data are presented from a field study of aye-ayes (Daubentonia
   madagascariensis) in an area of degraded secondary forest in northeast
   Madagascar. Animals were followed by radiotelemetry for 3 months during
   the cool dry season, when productivity of the forest is at a minimum.
   Population density was variable. Male home ranges were larger and
   overlapped the range of at least 1 female. Male ranges also overlapped,
   and areas of overlap could be occupied by 2 animals simultaneously. Most
   of the parties were solitary, but aggregations were observed at feeding
   sites. All activity was observed during darkness, and aye-ayes were
   always found to nest singly during the daytime. These patterns conform
   to those described for other nocturnal solitary prosimians. The aye-ayes
   showed versatility in their locomotor patterns, enabling them to use all
   types of supports and forest levels. Dietary diversity was high,
   although a preference for flower nectar was noted. These results suggest
   that, despite their anatomical specializations, aye-ayes are able to
   exploit a wide range of resources within recently degraded forest. This
   ability seems to allow aye-ayes to remain active throughout the year,
   unlike certain other nocturnal lemurs which become torpid during the dry
   season.},

   Microcebus murinus were found to be highly species-specific, bearing
   little resemblance to those of the galagines or the lemurids. Common

   DQB1 and DQB2 in all three species of prosimians studied suggests that
   the divergence of DQB1-DQB2 allelic lineages predates the divergence of
   human and prosimian lineages. The DQB2-like sequences from both species
   of the Galago seem more distant to human DQB2, and somewhat distant to
   that of the lemur DQB2 and bear numerous species-specific substitutions.
   It is not clear whether these DQB2-like alleles belong to a third DQB
   locus or are a true homologue of the contemporary HLA-DQB2 locus.},

Abstract = {Microscopic tooth-wear (microwear) patterns can be an important tool for
   assessing modes and rates of abrasive tooth wear, but their analysis and
   interpretation is complicated by the fact that microwear is influenced
   by many factors. Three of these factors were here tested under
   conditions of compressive loading: (I) species differences in enamel
   structure, (2) abrasive particle size and (3) magnitude of force. Teeth
   of four species (Homa sapiens, Lemur fulvus, Ovis aries and Crocodylus
   rhombifer) were abraded in vitro using three sizes of abrasive
   silicon-carbide grit (average diameters 73, 23 and 14 mu m), at two
   loads (50 and 100 kg). Microwear features were assessed by scanning
   electron microscopy of lightly etched enamel surfaces and epoxy
   replicas. Microwear pits (length:width <4:1) were the predominant
   feature type. Factorial analysis of variance of rank-transformed,
   feature-area measurements demonstrated that, under conditions of
   compressive loading, the size of abrasive particles was the primary
   determinant of microwear size. These results contrast with previous
   experimental tests of abrasion by predominantly shearing loads, where
   feature size was influenced by interaction among experimental factors,
   including the microscopic orientation of enamel crystallites. Although
   magnitude of compressive force was not a factor in microwear size
   variation, it may be a critical factor in explaining the presence or
   absence of microwear on tooth surfaces. The relatively small compressive
   bite force generated during typical chewing may not consistently produce
   abrasive pitting. These experiments demonstrate that, as the same
   abrasive regime can produce both large and small pits, the mechanism by
   which wear features are formed (i.e. compression or adhesion) cannot be
   determined from the size of features alone. Nevertheless, the dependence
   of pit size on abrasive particle size demonstrates that metrical
   variation in wear features can elucidate important attributes of an
   animal's diet.},

   hominoids (five species), Old World monkeys (seven species), New World
   monkeys (five species), tarsiers (two species), lemurs (six species),

   groups or combinations of groups were noted for gamma-glutamylcysteine
   synthetase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase
   activities. Lenticular gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase activity was
   very low in the Old World simian lenses and highest in the prosimians.
   Glutathione peroxidase activity was extraordinarily high in lenses of
   Old World monkeys. Glutathione reductase activity was low in all the
   prosimians but tenfold higher in hominoid lenses with intermediate
   values in monkeys of both the Old World and New World. Glutathione
   synthetase activity was variable, and no clear pattern which might be
   useful for primate classification was noted. Lenticular activity ratios
   of glutathione synthetase:gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase were highest

Abstract = {The lemurs of Madagascar typically exhibit a strictly seasonal pattern
   of breeding, with a limited number of successive estrous cycles

   strictly seasonal polyestrous pattern. Data from the author's 2-year
   field study of aye-ayes on the island of Nosy Mangabe, combined with
   information from recently initiated captive breeding programs, now
   indicate that this species in fact shows an extended breeding season or
   even year-round breeding. Actual mating or signs of estrus were observed
   in the field throughout a 5-month period (October-February). Further,
   data from captured pregnant females and young offspring indicate that
   births take place during the period from February to September. Apart
   from aye-ayes, extended breeding periods have been reported for wild
   Eulemur coronatus and for captive Eulemur fulvus and Mirza coquereli.
   Analysis of information on seasonal variation in food availability for

Abstract = {Twelve nonhuman primates of four species (two black and white ruffed
   lemurs {[}Varecia v. variegata], seven ring-tailed lemurs {[}Lemur
   catta], one white-handed gibbon {[}Hylobates lar], and two greater
   spotnose guenons {[}Cercopithecus n. nictitans]) developed typhoidal
   tularemia during a 6-wk tularemia epizootic in a zoological collection.
   Six died despite antibiotic treatment. An additional 13 asymptomatic
   primates of four species (three brown lemurs {[}Lemur macaco
   mayottensis], six thick-tailed bushbabies {[}Galago crassicaudatus],
   three greater spotnose guenons, and one white-handed gibbon) housed with
   or adjacent to symptomatic primates were prophylactically treated and
   did not develop illness. Seventy-three primates in the facility were not
   treated and did not develop tularemia nor did any other zoo animal.
   Clinical signs ranged from peracute death to varying degrees of lethargy
   and depression. Most ill primates were febrile (40.4-41.4 degrees C).
   Consistently observed serum biochemical abnormalities included
   elevations of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, phosphorus, alkaline
   phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, lactate
   dehydrogenase, and creatine phosphokinase. Two black and white ruffed
   lemurs had radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Gross necropsy
   abnormalities of the six primates (four ring-tailed lemurs, one greater
   spotnose guenon, one white-handed gibbon) included marked splenomegaly
   with 1-2-mm pale parenchymal foci, livers that were friable or had
   rounded or blunted margins, and pulmonary consolidation. Significant
   histologic findings included diffuse, acute, necrotizing splenitis with
   focal microabscess formation, hepatic necrosis with microabscesses, and
   acute bronchopneumonia. Francisella tularensis Type B was isolated in
   pure culture from the liver and lung of each primate that died. All but
   one of the six surviving symptomatic primates seroconverted or developed
   a fourfold rise in antibody titer. Two (a brown lemur and a thick-tailed
   bushbaby) of the 13 prophylactically treated asymptomatic primates and 3
   asymptomatic untreated lion-tailed macaques (Macaca silenus) were also
   seropositive. For several weeks prior to the nonhuman primate tularemia
   epizootic, multiple house mice (Mus musculus) had been found dead in the
   building in which the primates were housed. Indigenous rodent
   populations also appeared to be decreased. Francisella tularensis Type B
   was isolated from three of six mice collected in the building suggesting

Abstract = {Regurgitated food remains of the Barn Owl Tyto alba were collected
   within the rain forest of the Eastern Region of Madagascar (Andasibe and
   Manombo) and in the sub-arid thorn scrub of the Western Region (Beza
   Mahafaly). The material from Andasibe and Manombo represent single point
   samples, while 24 samples were collected from Beza Mahafaly between
   November 1990 and November 1991. A minimum of 176 individual
   vertebrates. representing 18 taxa, was identified from the Andasibe
   sample, and a minimum of 90 individual vertebrates of 5 taxa from the
   Manombo sample. The Beza Mahafaly samples included a minimum of 1013
   individual vertebrates of 22 taxa. At all three sites introduced rodents
   made up the bulk of the prey by number and by biomass, but at Beza
   Mahafaly lemurs and amphibia were also significant prey items. Insects
   constituted a small proportion of the prey. The results from these sites
   are compared with records of Barn Owl prey from mainland Africa.},

Title = {RELATIVE GROWTH OF THE LIMBS AND TRUNK IN SIFAKAS - HETEROCHRONIC,
   ECOLOGICAL, AND FUNCTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {92},
Number = {4},
Pages = {499-520},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Limb, trunk, and body weight measurements were obtained for growth
   series of Milne-Edwards's diademed sifaka, Propithecus diadema edwardsi,
   and the golden-crowned sifaka, Propithecus tattersalli. Similar measures
   were obtained also for primarily adults of two subspecies of the western
   sifaka: Propithecus verreauxi coquereli, Coquerel's sifaka, and
   Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi, Verreaux's sifaka. Ontogenetic series
   for the larger-bodied P. d. edwardsi and the smaller-bodied P.
   tattersalli were compared to evaluate whether species-level differences
   in body proportions result from the differential extension of common
   patterns of relative growth. In bivariate plots, both subspecies of P.
   verreauxi were included to examine whether these taxa also lie along a
   growth trajectory common to all sifakas.
   Analyses of the data indicate that postcranial proportions for sifakas
   are ontogenetically scaled, much as demonstrated previously with cranial
   dimensions for all three species (Ravosa, 1992). As such, P. d. edwardsi
   apparently develops larger overall size primarily by growing at a faster
   rate, but not for a longer duration of time, than P. tattersalli and P.
   verreauxi; this is similar to results based on cranial data. A
   consideration of Malagasy lemur ecology suggests that regional
   differences in forage quality and resource availability have strongly
   influenced the evolutionary development of body-size variation in
   sifakas. On one hand, the rainforest environment of P. d. edwardsi
   imposes greater selective pressures for larger body size than the
   dry-forest environment of P. tattersalli and P. v. coquereli, or the
   semi-arid climate of P. v. verreauxi. On the other hand, as
   progressively smaller-bodied adult sifakas are located in the east,
   west, and northwest, this apparently supports suggestions that adult
   body size is set by dry-season constraints on food quality and
   distribution (i.e., smaller taxa are located in more seasonal habitats
   such as the west and northeast). Moreover, the fact that body-size
   differentiation occurs primarily via differences in growth rate is also
   due apparently to differences in resource seasonality (and juvenile
   mortality risk in turn) between the eastern rainforest and the more
   temperate northeast and west.
   Most scaling coefficients for both arm and leg growth range from slight
   negative allometry to slight positive allometry. Given the low
   intermembral index for sifakas, which is also an adaptation for
   propulsive hindlimb-dominated jumping, this suggests that differences in
   adult limb proportions are largely set prenatally rather than being
   achieved via higher rates of postnatal hindlimb growth. Our analyses
   further indicate that the larger-bodied P. d. edwardsi has a higher
   adult intermembral index than P. tattersalli and P. verreauxi, thus
   supporting the allometric argument regarding the interspecific scaling
   of limb proportions in arboreal primates which employ vertical postures
   (Cartmill, 1974, 1985; Jungers, 1978, 1985).
   Lastly, additional analyses indicate that P. d. edwardsi exhibits
   significant sexual dimorphism where adult females are larger than adult
   males in about one-third of all adult comparisons, whereas P.
   tattersalli exhibits significant sexual dimorphism in about one-fifth of
   all adult comparisons. Among western sifakas, adult P. v. coquereli
   exhibit significant sex dimorphism in about one-third of all
   comparisons, whereas adult P. v. verreauxi show no significant
   differences between the sexes. Given that all taxa are ontogenetically
   scaled, this suggests that sexual dimorphism develops via such processes
   as well. Interestingly, our data indicate that sex dimorphism is
   allometric, with larger-bodied taxa like P. d. edwardsi being more
   dimorphic.},

Abstract = {I studied the diets of two sympatric species of Eulemur (E. fulvus rufus
   and E. rubriventer) in the Ranomafana National Part in southeastern
   Madagascar from July 1988 through August 1989. Both species were highly
   frugivorous throughout the year and devoted similar amounts of time to
   feeding daily; the composition of their diets were similar. Three
   aspects of both lemur species' diets were correlated with seasonal food
   availability: changes in interspecific dietary overlap, the length of
   feeding bouts, and the amount of time devoted to feeding daily.
   Throughout the year neither species had a more diverse or more
   folivorous diet than its sympatric congener: However, there were several
   consistent year-round differences between their diets. E. f. rufus
   initiated more feeding bouts daily that were shorter in duration than
   those of E. rubriventer. E. f. rufus also consistently exploited more
   unripe fruits and mature leaves than E. rubriventer did throughout the
   study. E. f. rufus migrated from the study site during a period of fruit
   scarcity. These dietary patterns are discussed here in regard to feeding
   patterns observed in other sympatric congeneric primate species, whether
   these dietary differences can contribute to these two species' ability
   to coexist, and how differences in diet may be influenced by differences
   in social structure. I suggest that subtle, consistent differences in
   diet and seasonal dietary differences are sufficient to allow these two
   species to coexist.},

Abstract = {This survey examines placental and fetal membrane structure, function,
   and development in nonhuman primates. It will focus on these aspects of
   fetal membranes in species exemplifying the two main types of primate
   placentation. The chorioallantoic placentas of most strepsirhine
   primates (e.g., lorises and lemurs), are diffuse, villous and
   epitheliochorial in structure. Villi are stout, usually unbranched and
   interdigitate with indentations in the uterine lining. Early in
   gestation trophoblast cells are columnar but with advancing gestational
   age considerable thinning of the interhemal membrane occurs. The villous
   tips have indented regions that appear to be involved in absorption of
   histotroph. Accessory placental structures known as areolae or chorionic
   vesicles occur in many strepsirhines. These are cup-shaped
   specializations that develop opposite the mouths of uterine glands and
   appear active in absorption of glandular secretions. In addition, most
   strepsirhines are characterized by a large yolk sac early in gestation,
   a transient choriovitelline placenta, and most have a large allantoic
   sac. In strepsirhines, amniogenesis occurs by folding. In contrast, the
   chorioallantoic placentas of most haplorhines are discoidal, villous,
   and hemochorial. The species emphasized in the review are macaque
   monkeys. The placental villi are covered by a layer of
   syncytiotrophoblast; the latter is active in maternal-fetal transport
   and hormone synthesis. In some haplorhines, extravillous trophoblast
   invades deeply into the endometrium and also into spiral arteries
   supplying the placenta. Other fetal membranes include 1) nonvillous
   chorion (chorion laeve); there is evidence supporting both an absorptive
   and synthetic role for trophoblast of the chorion laeve; 2) yolk sac,
   which is unusual in that a secondary yolk sac is formed. The yolk sac
   has both synthetic and absorptive functions in early gestation; and 3)
   amnion; amniogenesis in haplorhines occurs by cavitation. (C) 1993

Abstract = {Observations on the floral biology of the traveller's tree (Ravenala

   variegata), both endemic to the island of Madagascar, suggest a closely
   coevolved plant-pollinator relationship. The plant has many
   specializations for flower visitation by large non-flying animals and
   the lemurs appear to be dependent on nectar as a food source during
   specific times of the year. The basal phylogenetic position of Ravenala
   in the family Strelit-ziaceae, which diversified in the late Cretaceous
   and early Tertiary, is consistent with the hypothesis that pollination
   by lemurs is an archaic system in the family whereas bird- and
   bat-pollination systems are derived in the more advanced genera. These
   results provide supporting data for earlier hypotheses on the evolution
   of non-flying mammals as ancient pollinators of flowering plants.},

   examinations were subsequently performed and included bacteriologic
   culturing of fecal specimens for enteropathogenic bacteria and parasites
   and cytologic examination of feces. Data were collected for a 1-year
   period from 82 primates, and 14 gibbons were studied intensively.
   White-cheeked and siamang gibbons shed Shigella flexneri sporadically,
   but persistently. All gibbons were affected with a mean point prevalence
   of 30.7\% (range 0 to 71\%). Shigella flexneri also was isolated from
   feces of lion-tailed macaques. Shigella sonnei was isolated from feces
   of grey-cheeked mangabeys, celebes macaques, and spider monkeys. Of 180
   colonic mucosal biopsy specimens from 60 primates, 3 contained Shigella
   spp. Most S flexneri isolates were serotype Y.
   Our findings substantiated that enzootic shigellosis was more widespread
   at the National Zoological Park than signs of disease and results of a
   few bacteriologic cultures suggested. Those primate species affected
   were pinpointed, and the heterogeneity of Shigella spp involved was
   elucidated. Supportive diagnostic techniques were investigated and an
   unconventional protocol for performing bacteriologic culturing of fecal
   specimens was found useful in decreasing false-negative results.
   Epidemiologic findings and shedding patterns defined appropriateness of
   clinical management options.},

Abstract = {The relationship between phylogeny and taste is of growing interest. In
   this study we present recordings from the chorda tympani proper (CT)
   nerve of two lemuriforme primates, the lesser mouse lemur (Microcebus
   murinus) and the mongoose lemur (Eulemur mongoz), to an array of taste
   stimuli which included the sweeteners acesulfame-K, alitame, aspartame,
   D-glucose, dulcin, monellin, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (NHDHC),
   saccharin, sodium superaspartame, stevioside, sucralose (TGS), sucrose,
   suosan, thaumatin and xylitol, as well as the non-sweet stimuli NaCl,
   citric acid, tannin and quinine hydrochloride. In M. murinus the effects
   of the taste modifiers gymnemic acid and miraculin on the CT response
   were recorded. Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) experiments in M.
   murinus and two-bottle preference (TBP) tests in E. mongoz were also
   conducted. We found that all of the above tastants except thaumatin
   elicited a CT response in both species. The CTA technique showed that M.
   murinus generalized from sucrose to monellin but not to thaumatin. The
   intake of aspartame, ranging in concentration from 0.1 to 30 mM was
   measured in E. mongoz with TBP tests. At no concentration did we see a
   preference, but there was a significant rejection of 10 and 30 mM
   aspartame (P<0.025). Miraculin had no effects on the CT response to
   acids, and gymnemic acid did not selectively suppress the CT response to
   sucrose or that of any other sweeteners. The absence of ability to taste
   thaumatin in these species supports the dichotomy between catarrhine and
   non-catarrhine species. The difference in results with thaumatin and
   monellin indicate that their sweet moieties are not identical. It also
   points to a phylogenetic difference in taste within the prosimian group.
   Further, the results with aspartame indicate that the perception of
   sweetness from aspartame is limited to catarrhine species. Finally,
   neither miraculin nor gymnemic acid exhibit the same taste modifying
   effects in lemufiformes as they do in hominoidea. Thus the results with
   gymnemic acid and miraculin corroborate those obtained earlier in other
   prosimians.},

Abstract = {The immunoglobulin (Ig) allotypes (Gm, Am, and Km systems) are the

   light chain(Km). The Gm system, with 18 allotypes shows the greatest
   degree of polymorphism and we define two Am and three Km allotypes.
   In this review, we report all the results observed in non-human primates
   belonging to Hominoidea, Cercopithecoidea, Ceboidea, Lorisoidea,
   Lemuroidea, and Tupaoidea superfamilies (72 species and subspecies).
   They concern published data and new unpublished ones. The distribution
   of the human allotypes and their localization are reported, as well as
   discordant results observed in some cases with anti-allotype reagents of
   the same specificity (human and animal origin).
   Some allotypes are restricted to man. Hominoidea have the greatest
   number of Gm allotypes and the richest polymorphism. Relatively few
   allotypes have been found in Cercopithecoidea and Prosimians; most
   Platyrrhinian species have no allotype. The epitopic polymorphism has
   been interpreted in terms of evolution of Ig allotypes from primate to
   man and of the phylogenetic relationships of non-human primate species.},

Journal = {PRIMATES},

Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {181-196},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Populations and distributions of fiber types were studied in 19 limb
   muscles of Microcebus murinus. Proportions and cross-sectional areas of
   muscles fiber types were compared with data from the literature for
   other prosimians (Galago, Lemur, and Nycticebus), another primate
   (Macaca cynomolgus), and the rat.
   Most muscles are heterogenous, with type I fibers (slow oxidative)
   localized in the deeper part, near the bone. Type IIA fibers (fast
   oxidative glycolytic) are more evenly distributed than type I and type
   IIB (fast glycolytic). The combination of large number and large size of
   type I fibers results in enhanced slow-twitch and oxidative properties
   as required for antigravity function of postural muscles.
   Compared with other primates, Microcebus shows relatively small
   cross-sectional areas of fibers and less numerous type I fibers, in
   every muscle, which is probably related to small body mass. The fiber
   type population of the different components of the quadriceps femoris is
   also related to the particular mode of locomotion of the mouse-lemur:
   running and leaping, climbing and hopping. M. vastus medialis and m.
   vastus lateralis are made up only of fast twitch fibers, IIA and IIB.
   A possible repercussion of hypothyroidism during the rest season and a
   decrease in locomotor activity was the subject of investigation of the
   fiber type proportion and section areas. No difference were found
   between individuals euthanized during the active period and those at
   rest period. Either a very low level of thyroxine associated with
   reduced activity is sufficient to maintain the processes controlling
   myosin expression, or the effects on muscles fibers of natural
   hypothyroidism and hypokinesia neutralize each other during the rest
   season.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We present a new approach to the control of versions of software and
   other hierarchically structured entities. Any part of a system, from the
   smallest component to a complete system, may exist in different
   versions. The set of all possible versions under the refinement relation
   forms a partial order (in fact, a lattice). The fact that version V
   approximates version V' in this order means that V is relevant to V' in
   this sense: when constructing version V' of a system, we can sometimes
   use version V of a component if nothing more appropriate is available.
   More precisely, a particular version of an entire system is formed by
   combining the most relevant existing versions of the various components
   of the system. We call this the variant structure principle; it makes
   precise the idea that components of a given version of the system can be
   inherited by more refined versions of the system. We give an algebraic
   version language which allows histories (numbered series), subversions
   (or variants), and joins. In particular, the join operation is simply
   the lattice least upper bound. The join operation, together with the
   variant structure principle, provide a systematic framework for
   recombining divergent variants. We demonstrate the utility of this
   approach through LEMUR, a programming environment for modular C
   programs, which was developed using itself. Finally, we show how this
   notion of versions is related to the possible world semantics of
   intensional logic.},

Abstract = {The relationship between obesity and taste, especially sweet taste, has
   been and is of interest. From this point of view of a small primate, the
   lesser mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), is of particular interest. It
   goes through a yearly cycle of physiological changes, one of which is an
   extreme variation in body weight of up to 100 \%. This occurs
   concomitantly with significant changes of the animal's liking for
   sucrose; measured by two-bottle preference tests, the threshold for
   sucrose changes from 28-45 in lean to 77-105 mM in obese animals. It is
   possible that a change in peripheral taste sensitivity might be the
   cause for these preference changes. To test this possibility we studied
   the ability of M. murinus to taste sucrose with electrophysiological and
   conditioned taste aversion techniques. The electrophysiological
   recordings were obtained from the chorda tympani proper nerve in two
   heavy and three lean animals. We did not record any difference between
   the two groups in their neural response to a series of sucrose
   concentrations. Conditioned taste aversion experiments with 200 mM
   sucrose as conditioning stimulus and 50 and 200 mM sucrose as test
   stimuli gave similar results. No difference was found between three
   heavy and four lean animals; both groups rejected the sucrose
   concentrations. The results support the notion that the seasonal
   variations in preference threshold to sucrose were unrelated to the
   ability of M. murinus to taste sucrose.},

Abstract = {In haplorhine primates (tarsiers, monkeys, apes, and humans), there is a
   significant correlation between brain weight and maximum life-span when
   the effect of body size is removed. There is also a significant
   correlation in haplorhine primates between brain weight and female age
   at first reproduction. For strepsirhine primates (lorises and lemurs),
   there are no significant correlations between brain weight and either
   life-span or female reproductive age when the effect of body size is
   removed. This lack of correlation in strepsirhine primates may be
   related to the fact that these primates are nocturnal and/or natives of
   the island of Madagascar, both of which conditions may reduce
   competition for resources and predation pressure. These findings suggest
   that in haplorhine primates the genetic systems controlling brain growth
   are linked to the systems governing the life cycle so that species with
   longer cycles have larger brains. When the effect of body weight is
   removed, leaf-eating haplorhines have significantly smaller brains and
   shorter lives than haplorhines with other diets. Harem-living
   haplorhines also have significantly smaller brains and shorter
   life-spans than troop-living haplorhines when the effect of body weight
   is removed. We also sought to test the rate-of-living hypothesis by
   determining whether primates with basal metabolic rates that are higher
   than would be expected for their body size have shorter maximum
   life-spans than would be expected for their body size. Metabolic rate is
   not correlated with life-span or female age at first reproduction when
   the effect of body size is removed.},

Abstract = {The myxosporean parasite Kudoa thyrsites (Gilchrist) is well recognised
   as a cause of flesh liquefaction post-mortem in several fishes from both
   hemispheres. The observation of this condition in cultured mahi mahi,
   Coryphaena hippurus L., in Western Australia led us to search for
   possible reservoirs of infection amongst the abundant clupeoid fishes of
   the area. Prevalent and severe infections were found in Sardinops sagax
   neopilchardus (Steindachner), which we consider to be a major reservoir
   host for K. thyrsites in south-west Australian coastal waters. The
   parasite occurred less frequently in Spratelloides robustus Ogilby,
   Sardinella lemuru Bleeker and Engraulis australis (Shaw) from the same
   waters. Infection was not detected in Hyperlophus vittatus (Castelnau),
   Etrumeus teres (De Kay) or Nematalosa vlaminghi (Munro), which may
   reflect differences in range or dietary composition. Engraulis japonicus
   (Temminck \& Schlegel) imported from Japan were also infected, but a
   single sample of E. mordax Girard from California contained only an
   equipolar Kudoa species. These records expand the known host range of K.
   thyrsites to 20 species in 10 families, and several of these host
   species appear to be major reservoirs of infection in certain locations.
   Flesh spoilage due to the liquefactive effects of the parasite could
   occur in any of these hosts, and was seen here in S. sagax
   neopilchardus, S. robustus and E. japonicus in association with mature
   spores. Detection of infection with ultra-violet light was found to be
   ineffective because a cellular host response was not mounted by the
   clupeoids.},

Abstract = {Quadrupedal locomotion was mechanically studied for four species of
   primates, the chimpanzee, the rhesus macaque, the tufted capuchin, and
   the ring-tailed lemur, from low to high speeds of about two to ten times
   the anterior trunk length per second. A wide variety of locomotor
   patterns was observed during the high-speed locomotion of these
   primates. Positive correlations were observed between the peak magnitude
   of foot force components and speed. The differentiation of the foot
   force between the forelimb and the hindlimb did not largely change with
   a change of speed for each species. The vertical component and the
   accelerating component for the rhesus macaque were relatively large in
   the forelimb from low- to high-speed locomotion. The rhesus macaque,
   which habitually locomotes on the ground, differed in the quadrupedal
   locomotion from the other relatively arboreal primates, for which the
   hindlimb was clearly dominant in their dynamic force-producing
   distribution between the forelimbs and the hindlimbs. The previously
   reported locomotor difference, which was indicated among primates from
   the foot force pattern between the forelimb and the hindlimb during
   walking, also applied to high-speed locomotion.},

Abstract = {The activities of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione

   Gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase activity decreased as a function of
   age in all three Old World simians. The rate of decrease was greatest in
   the juvenile lenses. In contrast, the enzyme activity increased
   continuously with age in the galago lens. In the mouse lemur the enzyme
   activity increased per lens, but was constant when expressed as specific
   activity or as units per gram of lens. The loss of enzyme activity with
   age was limited to Old World higher primates apparently representing

Abstract = {The evolutionary relationships of the various orders of placental
   mammals remain an issue of uncertainty and controversy. Molecular
   studies of mammalian phylogeny at the DNA level that include more than
   just a few orders are still relatively meager. Here we report results on
   mammalian phylogeny deduced from the coding sequence of the single-copy
   nuclear gene for the inter-photoreceptor retinoid binding protein
   (IRBP). Analysis of 13 species representing eight eutherian orders and
   one marsupial yielded results that falsify the hypothesis that
   megachiropteran bats are ``flying primates,{''} only convergently
   resembling microchiropteran bats. Instead, in agreement with more
   traditional views, as well as those from other recent molecular studies,
   the results strongly support a monophyletic Chiroptera (micro- and
   megabats grouped together). The IRBP results also offer some rare
   molecular support for the Glires concept, in which rodents and
   lagomorphs form a superordinal grouping. Also in congruence with other
   recent molecular evidence, IRBP sequences do not support the view of a
   superorder Archonta that includes Chiroptera along with Dermoptera
   (flying lemur), Scandentia (tree shrew), and Primates. IRBP was not
   however, without its shortcomings as a molecular phylogenetic system:
   high levels of homoplasy, evident in the marsupial outgroup, did not
   allow us to properly root the tree, and several of the higher level
   eutherian clades were only weakly supported (e.g., a
   Carnivora/Chiroptera clade and an Artiodactyla/Carnivora/ Chiroptera
   clade). We suggest that these shortcomings may be diminished as the
   phylogenetic density of the data set is increased. (c) 1992 Academic

   megabats actually ``flying primates{''}? These questions were addressed
   by phylogenetic analysis of epsilon-globin gene sequences from a number

   not only support bat monophyly, but the strength of Chiroptera grouping
   is comparable to that supporting the monophyly of the prosimian primate
   suborder Strepsirhini (galago and lemur). Furthermore, 39 derived

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {In this paper, I describe the differential patterns of flower feeding
   observed in rufous lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus) and red-bellied lemurs
   (E. rubriventer) in the Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar.
   Red-bellied lemurs licked nectar from flowers while rufous lemurs ate
   all flower parts from the same flower species. Several hypotheses are
   examined to explain the significance of flower feeding in these two
   species. In many primate species, flower feeding functions as a keystone
   resource and/or primates act as pollinators while feeding on flowers.
   Although peak flower feeding occurred during a decline in food
   availability, fruit was always the preferred food item so that flowers
   did not function as a keystone resource. Second, red-bellied lemurs
   appear to be potentially better pollinators compared to the rufous
   lemurs because 1) they left flower reproductive parts intact while
   feeding, 2) they visited more than one tree or liana of the same plant
   species in the same day, 3) pollen was observed on the faces of
   individuals as they traveled from plant to plant, and 4) they have a
   feathered, brush-like tip on their tongue which rufous lemurs lack.
   Finally, the difference in flower feeding styles between the lemur
   species also affected three aspects of diet: 1) feeding bout duration,
   2) the size of feeding sub-groups, and 3) return visits to flowering
   sources. These subtle differences in diet within food categories can
   allow these two otherwise similar lemur species to coexist.},

Abstract = {The superorder Archonta has been hypothesized to include primates, tree
   shrews, bats, and flying lemurs as descendants of a common ancestor.
   More recently, a diphyletic origin for bats has been proposed. To
   evaluate these hypotheses, the nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial
   cytochrome oxidase subunit II gene was determined from a bushbaby
   (Galago senegalensis), flying lemur (Cynocephalus variegatus), tree
   shrew (Tupaia glis), spear-nosed bat (Phyllostomus hastatus), rousette
   bat (Rousettus leschenaulti), and nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus
   novemcinctus) and was compared with published sequences of a human, cow,
   and mouse. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences give evidence that
   primates, tree shrews, and flying lemurs have a recent common ancestor
   but that bats are genealogically distant. The monophyletic origin of
   bats is supported. Contrary to interpretations based on morphological
   data, tree shrews are shown to be no more closely affiliated with
   primates than are flying lemurs. Analyses of the cytochrome oxidase
   subunit II gene give marginally more support to a Dermoptera-Scandentia
   clade than to a Dermoptera-Primates clade.},

Abstract = {More than one hundred undescribed foot elements of Cantius and other
   closely related notharctine adapids (7 species in all) from throughout
   the early Eocene (Wasatchian) Willwood Formation of the Bighorn Basin,
   Wyoming, have been analyzed. For four species (Cantius ralstoni,
   ``Copelemur{''} feretutus, Cantius frugivorus, and ?Pelycodus jarrovii)
   these represent the first described postcranial material. The clade of
   Cantius and allied genera in the Bighorn Basin includes several
   speciation events and both increases and decreases in body size. The
   largest species represented by tarsal remains (?Pelycodus jarrovii) is
   several times larger than the smallest, Cantius ralstoni. However,
   despite the number of species, temporal duration, and range of body size
   represented, there are no obvious changes in foot morphology as measured
   by various indices or by observation of qualitative features. This
   contrasts with the more obvious changes in dental features (e.g.,
   development of hypocone and mesostyle) in the same group of species
   described by earlier authors. The fossil record of Cantius thus
   illustrates different kinds of evolutionary change in the dentition and
   tarsus. The dentition changes in both size and shape while the tarsus
   changes only in size. We describe significant differences in foot
   anatomy which distinguish notharctines from extant strepsirhines,
   including the nature of the articulations between the navicular and
   cuboid and the distal tarsus with the metatarsus. These features
   indicate that the fossil taxa are not particularly closely allied
   phylogenetically to either extant strepsirhines in general or lemurids
   in particular.},

Abstract = {The anisotropic fracturing and differential wear properties of enamel
   microstructure represent factors that can obscure the predictive
   relationship between dental microwear and diet.  To assess the impact of
   enamel structure on microwear, this in vitro experimental study examines
   the relative contributions to wear of three factors:  1) species
   differences in microstructure, 2) direction of shearing force relative
   to enamel prisms and crystallites, and 3) size of abrasive particles. 
   Teeth of Lemur, Ovis, Homo, and Crocodylus, representing, respectively,
   the structural categories of prismatic patterns 1, 2, and 3 and
   nonprismatic enamel, were abraded by shearing forces (forces having a
   component directed parallel to abraded surfaces) and examined by
   scanning electron microscopy.  Striation width increased with particle
   size for nonprismatic, but not for prismatic, specimens.  Direction of
   shear relative to prism and crystallite orientation had a significant
   influence on striation width in only some prismatic enamels.  The
   different responses of prismatic and nonprismatic enamels to abrasion
   reflect the influence of structure, but at the level of organization of
   crystallites rather than prisms per se.  Such interactions explain in
   part the inability of striation width to discriminate among animals with
   different dietary habits.  Heteroscedasticity and deviations from
   normality also may confound parametric analyses of microwear variables. 
   Variation in crystallite orientation in prismatic enamels may contribute
   to optimal dental function through the property of differential wear in
   functionally distinct regions of teeth.},

Abstract = {The delta-globin gene in simian primates is either weakly expressed (in
   hominoids and New World monkeys)  or silent (in Old World monkeys).  In
   prosimian primates, however, an unequal homologous crossover between the
   psi-eta and delta-loci of lemurs produced a hybrid
   psi-eta-delta-pseudogene locus, whereas in tarsier the delta-locus
   encodes a beta-type chain found in 18\% of adult tarsier hemoglobin
   molecules.  In the present study, the nucleotide and amino acid
   sequences of the galago-delta and beta-globin genes and their encoded
   peptides were determined, and evidence is provided showing that the
   galago-delta-locus encodes a beta-type chain  (beta-2) found in 40\% of
   the galago fetal and postnatal hemoglobin molecules, whereas the
   beta-locus encodes the remaining 60\% of the beta-type chain (beta-1). 
   Galago beta-1 and beta-2 chains differ from each other by only one amino
   acid residue.  The homology between the galago delta and beta-loci
   extends from 800 base pairs 5' of the proximal CCAAT element to near the
   end of exon 3 as a result of a recombination event in which
   beta-sequence replaced delta-sequence.  After this initial recombination
   event, concerted evolution between the loci continued over their
   conserved coding, intron 1, and promoter regions but failed to occur
   between the two loci in their intron 2 and distal 5'-flanking sequences
   where the two loci have now diverged by 20\%.  Calculations based on
   this divergence value and on a rate of noncoding sequence evolution of
   4.2 x 10(-9) to 5.5 x 10(-9) substitutions/site/year for the lorisform
   lineage to galago yielded a date of 18-24 million years ago for the
   initial recombination event.  The fact that the promoter sequences of
   the galago delta-locus are the same as that of the galago beta-locus may
   account for the high level of expression of the galago delta-gene.},

   DNA family (Type II) in the prosimian, Galago crassicaudatus.  We
   present here a detailed analysis of seventeen members of a third galago
   SINE family designated as the Monomer family.  Both the Monomer and Type
   II families are shown to be specific for the galago genome as compared
   to other primates, including another prosimian, the lemur.  Moreover, in
   vitro transcription of galago SINEs suggests that the Monomer and Type
   II families have appreciably stronger RNA polymerase III promoters than
   does the Alu family.  This agrees with the promoter sequence for each of
   these SINE families, in that the Monomer and Type II family promoters
   are more closely related to the RNA polymerase III promoter consensus
   sequence than is the Alu family promoter.  These promoter strength
   analyses also correlate with copy number and sequence divergence
   analyses, which suggests that the SINE families with the strongest
   promoters have been amplified most recently in the galago genome.},

Abstract = {We studied Aotus lemurinus, Panamanian night monkeys, for susceptibility
   to Toxoplasma infection and for their capacity to develop immunity using
   either sulfadiazine prophylaxis or the non-persistent ts-4 vaccine. The
   animals were highly susceptible to infection with a mouse pathogenic
   (T265) and a mouse nonpathogenic (T163) Toxoplasma isolate. A calculated
   single bradyzoite by mouth gave rise to infection which was fatal in
   nine to 12 days. Chemoprophylaxis with 60-300 of sulfadiazine mg per day
   for up to 40 days protected the animals; however this was followed by
   fatal reactivation of infection between 11 and 70 days after treatment
   was stopped. Vaccination was carried out in two or three doses
   subcutaneously. Challenge was performed in 26 animals using both
   Toxoplasma isolates. Five monkeys (19\%) survived for over a year, 10
   died after a prolonged illness, and 11 died as rapidly as the seven
   controls. Safety tests showed the vaccine to be nonpathogenic in 111
   adults except for slight fever and local inflammation, although one of
   four juveniles died from disseminated infection. Vaccination of 25
   pregnant monkeys was non-pathogenic; however two of 25 fetuses were
   aborted, one of which was infected and one newborn had microphthalmia,
   retinitis and a cataract; four of the offspring were not tested. When
   six lactating monkeys were vaccinated, Toxoplasma was not transmitted to
   the infants. The high susceptibility to Toxoplasma and the low
   immunizability was circumstantially attributed to absence of exposure
   and lack of selection by Toxoplasma of these arboreal monkeys even
   though about 50\% of terrestrial animals from the same area were
   infected. Therefore, because they are apparently unselected by
   Toxoplasma, these monkeys proved to be a sensitive primate model for
   safety tests. They are however, unsuitable for evaluation of vaccine
   potency which was demonstrated in mice, hamsters and rabbits.},

Abstract = {Recently it was reported that limb joint surface areas scale positively
   allometrically with body weight in anthropoid primates. This was
   attributed to the biomechanics of weight bearing: larger animals must
   require relatively larger joint surfaces to withstand relatively greater
   weight-related stresses on the joints. Our data on humeral and femoral
   geometry and joint surface areas in 73 species belonging to six
   mammalian orders (including primates) demonstrate that positive
   allometry of joint surface areas is not a general phenomenon for mammals
   and cannot have its basis among Anthropoidea in the biomechanics of
   weight bearing. We argue that, to the extent that positive allometric
   scaling of joint surface areas occurs in anthropoid primates, it is an
   artifact of differences in positional behaviour among distinct taxonomic
   groups that also happen to differ widely in body weight. Furthermore, we
   argue that, among mammals ranging in body size from sportive lemurs to
   giant pandas, functionally similar groups tend to exhibit: (1) linear
   dimensions (especially diameters and shaft circumferences) that scale in
   direct proportion to each other; and (2) joint surface areas that scale
   in direct proportion to the squares of linear dimensions and to the 2/3
   power of body mass. In other words, limb bones of functionally similar
   animals fit the theoretical model of geometric similarity (or skeletal
   isometry). Differences in relative sizes of joint surface areas are
   related to differences in force transmission and movement potential
   among functionally distinct groups of animals.},

Abstract = {An 8.4-kb genomic region spanning both the psi-eta-globin gene locus and
   flanking DNA was sequenced from the common gibbon (Hylobates lar). In
   addition, sequencing of the entire orthologous region from galago
   (Galago crassicaudatus) was completed. The gibbon and galago sequences,
   along with published orthologous sequences from 10 other species, were
   aligned. These noncoding nucleotide sequences represented four human
   alleles, four apes (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon), an Old
   World monkey (rhesus monkey), two New World monkeys (spider and owl
   monkeys), tarsier, two strepsirhines (galago and lemur), and goat.
   Divergence and maximum parsimony analyses of the psi-eta genomic region
   first groups humans and chimpanzees and then, at progressively more
   ancient branch points, successively joins gorillas, orangutans, gibbons,
   Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, tarsiers, and strepsirhines (the
   lemuriform-lorisiform branch of primates). This cladistic pattern
   supports the taxonomic grouping of all extant hominoids into family
   Hominidae, the division of Hominidae into subfamilies Hylobatinae
   (gibbons) and Homininae, the division of Homininae into tribes Pongini
   (orangutans) and Hominini, and the division of Hominini into subtribes
   Gorillina (gorillas) and Hominina (chimpanzees and humans). The
   additional gibbon and galago sequence data provide further support for
   the occurrence of a graded evolutionary-rate slowdown in the descent of
   simian primates, with the slowing rate being more pronounced in the
   great-ape and human lineages than in the gibbon or monkey lineages. A
   comparison of global versus local molecular clocks reveals that local
   clock predictions, when focused on a specific number of species within a
   narrow time frame, provide a more accurate estimate of divergence dates
   than do those of global clocks.},

Abstract = {Two opposing hypotheses concerning the origin of bats, as well as flight
   in mammals, have been proposed.  In one, all bats shared a common
   ancestor after diverging from the remainder of extant Mammalia, whereas
   in the other, Megachiroptera, Primates, and Dermoptera shared a common
   ancestor after diverging from the Microchiroptera.  In the latter
   hypothesis, flight in mammals would have evolved twice.  To discriminate
   between the two competing hypotheses, we mapped 52 restriction sites for
   the ribosomal cistron (rDNA) for representative taxa using a mole, a
   shrew, and Mus as outgroups.  We examined 14 genera representing 13
   families of Microchiroptera, 5 genera of Megachiroptera, Cynocephalus
   (order Dermoptera), and Homo and Lemur (order Primates).  Of the 52
   mapped restriction sites, 24 were shared among all taxa.  Resolution of
   the two alternative hypotheses was not found within these data.  The
   only potentially resolving site was a Pvu II site in the nontranscribed
   spacer that united Dermoptera with the five genera of Megachiroptera. 
   No synapomorphic site linked all bats, all Microchiroptera, or
   Megachiroptera, Dermoptera, and Primates.  It is hypothesized that the
   lack of resolution from these molecular data originates from these taxa
   sharing a common ancestor for a relatively short time after diverging
   from the remainder of extant Mammalia.  Such a short time in a common
   ancestor would permit few molecular events in conservatively evolving
   DNA sequences to become established to document a common origin. 
   Alternatively, events that became established in rapidly evolving
   molecules would be lost or obscured due to extensive evolution over the
   long term since the Primates, Megachiroptera, Microchiroptera, and
   Dermoptera separated from each other.},

Abstract = {The fine structure of spermatozoa from the cauda epididymidis of six
   species of elephant shrews (Petrodromus tetradactylus, Macroscelides
   proboscideus, Elephantulus brachyrhynchus, E. edwardii, E. intufi, E.
   myurus) is described.  The spermatozoa of all species are generally
   similar with minor interspecific differences.  The head is long and
   flattened, capped with an acrosome which has a long apical segment and
   which extends distally for 60-70\% of the length of the nucleus.  A
   prominent subacrosome is present in all species, in Elephantulus spp. it
   is anvil-shaped with two lateral `barbs'.  Axonemal coarse fibres 1, 5,
   6 and 9 are larger than the others.  In E. edwardii the coarse fibres
   are particularly large and are associated with a wider and longer
   midpiece and more mitochondrial gyres than in any other species.  The
   ultrastructure of elephant shrew spermatozoa gives no support for a
   suggested relationship with lagomorphs, but shows some similarities with
   Megachiroptera, moles (Insectivora) and lemurs (Primates):  orders
   sometimes associated in the Archonta.},

   when females were parous and ovipositing (i.e. during spring at the

   as a measure of dung burial the most important spring active beetles at

   laticollis, Onthophagus lemur and Copris hispanus, and at the temperate
   sites:  C. lunaris, O. vacca, and O. ovatus.  These results confirmed
   the previous choice of C. hispanus, C. lunaris, B. bison and O. vacca
   for introduction into Australia.  In addition it is suggested that B.
   bubalus, S. laticollis and O. lemur be considered for introduction into
   mediterranean areas of south western Australia to complement those

Abstract = {Proteins secreted by human seminal vesicles are strongly positively
   charged. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis show how the presence of two
   protein bands of vesicular origin (N3 and N4). When studied on SDS-PAGE
   there are three main bands of molecular weight 67, 45 and 40 kDa,
   respectively. These proteins may be separated by a chromatographic
   process using gel filtration on Sephadex G 25 M and ion exchange
   chromatography on CM and SP Sephadex C 50. Fructose, secreted by seminal
   vesicles, is excreted with specific proteins and these complexes take
   part to coagulum formation. During liquefaction glucose appears
   progressively and fructose is released from complexes with proteins.
   Interconversion processes that transform fructose into glucose,
   originate from prostatic secretion. In man, the liquefaction process
   seems to be not due to proteolysis, but by the way of other mechanisms
   that transform vesicular proteins of very high molecular weight into
   sub-units with lower molecular weights in the first minutes after
   ejaculation. In species other than man, i.e. lemurian, fructose takes
   part in the coagulation process with other components (albumin, ions,
   -SH groups). Cholesterol appears to be in relation with proteins which
   have high molecular weights. Half of phospholipid content of seminal
   plasma is probably free. Incubation of seminal plasma with spermatozoa
   show that these cells use triglycerides for their metabolism. The ratio
   between cholesterol and phospholipids is an important marker for the
   capacitation-decapacitation process.},

Abstract = {Simple Summary The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made
   it harder to effectively protect and manage biodiversity, and this could
   make it more difficult for countries to show progress towards the
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here, we surveyed experts in early
   2022 from 30 countries to collect data on the impacts of COVID-19 on
   non-human primate research and conservation initiatives. Of the 93
   experts that responded to our survey, we found that 39\% had not been
   able to visit any of their field sites since March 2020 and only one out
   of ten had managed to achieve at least 76-100\% of their planned
   primate-related work since March 2020. Six out of ten respondents (61\%)
   felt that primate conservation efforts in protected areas were worse
   than before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and one-third (33\%) felt
   hunting was happening more frequently than before. This study provides
   evidence of the impacts of COVID-19 on progress towards achieving SDG15
   (Life on Land) and provides practical lessons learned for biodiversity
   conservation efforts moving forward. There is evidence to suggest that
   the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may hamper our
   achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here, we use
   non-human primates as a case study to examine the impacts of COVID-19 on
   the ability to achieve biodiversity conservation and management
   sustainability targets. We collected data through a survey of members of
   the IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group from January to March 2022. Of the
   93 experts that responded to our survey, we found that 39\% had not been
   able to visit any of their field sites since March 2020, 54\% said they
   had less funding available for their primate-related work, and only one
   out of ten said they had managed to achieve at least 76-100\% of their
   planned primate-related work since March 2020. Six out of ten
   respondents (61\%) felt that primate conservation efforts in protected
   areas were worse than before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and
   one-third (33\%) felt hunting was happening more frequently than before.

Title = {Widespread loss of mammalian lineage and dietary diversity in the early
   Oligocene of Afro-Arabia},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {Using time-scaled phylogenies of several endemic clades of small
   Afro-Arabian mammals, Dorien de Vries et al. infer a steep drop in
   species numbers around the Eocene-Oligocene transition. This dramatic
   decline coincides with a global cooling trend as well as the onset of
   widespread flood basalt volcanism in East Africa, and is found to be
   correlated with a major loss in dietary diversity.
   Diverse lines of geological and geochemical evidence indicate that the
   Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT) marked the onset of a global cooling
   phase, rapid growth of the Antarctic ice sheet, and a worldwide drop in
   sea level. Paleontologists have established that shifts in mammalian
   community structure in Europe and Asia were broadly coincident with
   these events, but the potential impact of early Oligocene climate change
   on the mammalian communities of Afro-Arabia has long been unclear. Here
   we employ dated phylogenies of multiple endemic Afro-Arabian mammal
   clades (anomaluroid and hystricognath rodents, anthropoid and
   strepsirrhine primates, and carnivorous hyaenodonts) to investigate
   lineage diversification and loss since the early Eocene. These analyses
   provide evidence for widespread mammalian extinction in the early
   Oligocene of Afro-Arabia, with almost two-thirds of peak late Eocene
   diversity lost in these clades by similar to 30 Ma. Using homology-free
   dental topographic metrics, we further demonstrate that the loss of
   Afro-Arabian rodent and primate lineages was associated with a major
   reduction in molar occlusal topographic disparity, suggesting a
   correlated loss of dietary diversity. These results raise new questions
   about the relative importance of global versus local influences in
   shaping the evolutionary trajectories of Afro-Arabia's endemic mammals
   during the Oligocene.},

Abstract = {Madagascar experienced a major faunal turnover near the end of the first
   millenium CE that particularly affected terrestrial, large-bodied
   vertebrate species. Teasing apart the relative impacts of people and
   climate on this event requires a focus on regional records with good
   chronological control. These records may document coeval changes in
   rainfall, faunal composition, and human activities. Here we present new
   paleontological and paleoclimatological data from southwestern
   Madagascar, the driest part of the island today. We collected over 1500
   subfossil bones from deposits at a coastal site called Antsirafaly and
   from both flooded and dry cave deposits at Tsimanampesotse National
   Park. We built a chronology of Late Holocene changes in faunal
   assemblages based on 65 radiocarbon-dated specimens and subfossil
   associations. We collected stalagmites primarily within Tsimanampesotse
   but also at two additional locations in southern Madagascar. These
   provided information regarding hydroclimate variability over the past
   120,000 years. Prior research has supported a primary role for drought
   (rather than humans) in triggering faunal turnover at Tsimanampesotse.
   This is based on evidence of: (1) a large freshwater ecosystem west of
   what is now the hypersaline Lake Tsimanampesotse, which supported
   freshwater mollusks and waterfowl (including animals that could not
   survive on resources offered by the hypersaline lake today); (2)
   abundant now-extinct terrestrial vertebrates; (3) regional decline or
   disappearance of certain tree species; and (4) scant local human
   presence. Our new data allow us to document the hydroclimate of the
   subarid southwest during the Holocene, as well as shifts in faunal
   composition (including local extirpations, large-vertebrate population
   collapse, and the appearance of introduced species). These records
   affirm that climate alone cannot have produced the observed vertebrate
   turnover in the southwest. Human activity, including the introduction of
   cattle, as well as associated changes in habitat exploitation, also
   played an important role.},

Abstract = {Documenting the impacts of climate change and human activities on
   tropical rainforests is imperative for protecting tropical biodiversity
   and for better implementation of REDD+ and UN Sustainable Development
   Goals. Recent advances in very high-resolution satellite sensor systems
   (i.e., WorldView-3), computing power, and machine learning (ML) have
   provided improved mapping of fine-scale changes in the tropics. However,
   approaches so far focused on feature extraction or the extensive tuning
   of ML parameters, hindering the potential of ML in forest conservation
   mapping by not using textural information, which is found to be powerful
   for many applications. Additionally, the contribution of shortwave
   infrared (SWIR) bands in forest cover mapping is unknown. The objectives
   were to develop end-to-end mapping of the tropical forest using fully
   convolution neural networks (FCNNs) with WorldView-3 (WV-3) imagery and
   to evaluate human impact on the environment using the Betampona Nature
   Reserve (BNR) in Madagascar as the test site. FCNN (U-Net) using
   spatial/textural information was implemented and compared with
   feature-fed pixel-based methods including Support Vector Machine (SVM),
   Random Forest (RF), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Results show that the
   FCNN model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 90.9\%, while
   SVM, RF, and DNN provided accuracies of 88.6\%, 84.8\%, and 86.6\%,
   respectively. When SWIR bands were excluded from the input data, FCNN
   provided superior performance over other methods with a 1.87\% decrease
   in accuracy, while the accuracies of other models-SVM, RF, and
   DNN-decreased by 5.42\%, 3.18\%, and 8.55\%, respectively.
   Spatial-temporal analysis showed a 0.7\% increase in Evergreen Forest
   within the BNR and a 32\% increase in tree cover within residential
   areas likely due to forest regeneration and conservation efforts. Other
   effects of conservation efforts are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Tropical ecosystems host a large proportion of global biodiversity and
   directly support the livelihoods of many of the world's poorest, and
   often marginalized, people through ecosystem goods and services and
   conservation employment. The coronavirus pandemic has challenged
   existing conservation structures and management but provides an
   opportunity to re-examine strategies and research approaches across the
   tropics to build resilience for future crises. Based on the personal
   experiences of conservation leaders, managers, and researchers from
   Madagascar during this period, we discuss the coping strategies of
   multiple biodiversity conservation organizations during the coronavirus
   pandemic. We highlight the vital role of local communities in building
   and maintaining resilient conservation practices that are robust to
   global disruptions such as the COVID-19 crisis. We argue that the
   integration of local experts and communities in conservation, research,
   and financial decision-making is essential to a strong foundation for
   biodiversity conservation in developing countries to stand up to future
   environmental, political, and health crises. This integration could be
   achieved through the support of training and capacity building of local
   researchers and community members and these actions would also enhance
   the development of strong, equitable long-term collaborations with
   international communities. Equipped with such capacity, conservationists
   and researchers from these regions could establish long-term
   biodiversity conservation strategies that are adapted to local context,
   and communities could flexibly balance biodiversity and livelihood needs
   as circumstances change, including weathering the isolation and
   financial challenges of local or global crises.},

Title = {A comparative analysis of the vestibular apparatus in Epipliopithecus
   vindobonensis: Phylogenetic implications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {151},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Pliopithecoids are an extinct group of catarrhine primates from the
   Miocene of Eurasia. More than 50 years ago, they were linked to
   hylobatids due to some morphological similarities, but most subsequent
   studies have supported a stem catarrhine status, due to the retention of
   multiple plesiomorphic features (e.g., the ectotympanic morphology)
   relative to crown catarrhines. More recently, some morphological
   similarities to hominoids have been noted, raising the question of
   whether they could be stem members of this Glade. To re-evaluate these
   competing hypotheses, we examine the morphology of the semicircular
   canals of the bony labyrinth of the middle Miocene pliopithecid
   Epipliopithecus vindobonensis. The semicircular canals are suitable to
   test between these hypotheses because (1) they have been shown to embed
   strong phylogenetic signal and reliably discriminate among major clades;
   (2) several potential hominoid synapomorphies have been identified
   previously in the semicircular canals; and (3) semicircular canal
   morphology has not been previously described for any pliopithecoid. We
   use a deformation-based (landmark-free) three-dimensional geometric
   morphometric approach to compare Epipliopithecus with a broad primate
   sample of extant and extinct anthropoids. We quantify similarities in
   semicircular canal morphology using multivariate analyses, reconstruct
   ancestral morphotypes by means of a phylomorphospace approach, and
   identify catarrhine and hominoid synapomorphies based on discrete
   characters. Epipliopithecus semicircular canal morphology most closely
   resembles that of platyrrhines and Aegyptopithecus due to the retention
   of multiple anthropoid symplesiomorphies. However, Epipliopithecus is
   most parsimoniously interpreted as a stem catarrhine more derived than
   Aegyptopithecus due to the possession of a crown catarrhine synapomorphy
   (i.e., the rounded anterior canal), combined with the lack of other
   catarrhine and any hominoid synapomorphies. Some similarities with
   hylobatids and atelids are interpreted as homoplasies likely related to
   positional behavior. The semicircular canal morphology of
   Epipliopithecus thus supports the common view that pliopithecoids are
   stem catarrhines. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   composition on Leptospira prevalence in northeast Madagascar},

Abstract = {Human activities can increase or decrease risks of acquiring a zoonotic
   disease, notably by affecting the composition and abundance of hosts.
   This study investigated the links between land use and infectious
   disease risk in northeast Madagascar, where human subsistence activities
   and population growth are encroaching on native habitats and the
   associated biota. We collected new data on pathogenic Leptospira, which
   are bacteria maintained in small mammal reservoirs. Transmission can
   occur through close contact, but most frequently through indirect
   contact with water contaminated by the urine of infected hosts. The
   probability of infection and prevalence was compared across a gradient
   of natural moist evergreen forest, nearby forest fragments, flooded rice
   and other types of agricultural fields, and in homes in a rural village.
   Using these data, we tested specific hypotheses for how land use alters
   ecological communities and influences disease transmission. The relative
   abundance and proportion of exotic species was highest in the
   anthropogenic habitats, while the relative abundance of native species
   was highest in the forested habitats. Prevalence of Leptospira was
   significantly higher in introduced compared to endemic species. Lastly,
   the probability of infection with Leptospira was highest in introduced
   small mammal species, and lower in forest fragments compared to other
   habitat types. Our results highlight how human land use affects the
   small mammal community composition and in turn disease dynamics.
   Introduced species likely transmit Leptospira to native species where
   they co-occur, and may displace the Leptospira species naturally
   occurring in Madagascar. The frequent spatial overlap of people and
   introduced species likely also has consequences for public health.
   Author summary
   Many neglected tropical diseases have reservoirs in wildlife. The
   effects of human activities on wildlife include changes in species
   abundance, community composition, and the transmission dynamics of
   parasites. Introduced species, especially black rats (Rattus rattus) are
   known to transmit zoonotic diseases among wildlife species and people.
   Leptospira, a water-borne bacterium that infects wildlife and people, is
   an important pathogen in the tropics, and in Madagascar, multiple
   strains and hosts have been identified. We tested how land use gradients
   in a forest-frontier agricultural system affect the composition of small
   mammal communities, and in turn the prevalence of Leptospira. We
   investigated 11 species of small mammals, including native rodents and
   tenrecs, as well as introduced rodents and shrews, in old growth forest,
   forest fragments, agricultural fields, and in a village. Leptospira
   prevalence and infection risk were highest in introduced species
   compared to native species and lower in forest fragments. The results
   highlight how the introduction of non-native species affects the
   variation in disease prevalence in small mammals, with potential
   consequences for spill-over to people.},

Abstract = {The DC traction networks arc widely used for urban transportation and
   short distances. The DC substations transfer the power between the main
   AC grid and the DC network. The open circuit voltage of the DC
   substation may be fixed based on the tap changer configuration of the
   transformer or using a dynamic control over the AC/DC converter. This
   article studies the effects of the selection of this voltage over the
   network performance which can be represented by the overall energy
   efficiency of the system. The simulation models are simplified to speed
   up the solver under the consideration of the required accuracy. The
   Aggregated data are used to reduce the storage requirements to save the
   results of all simulations. This study represents a systematic procedure
   for selecting the substation voltage to reduce the total losses of the
   system. The results of the testing on a real case demonstrates the
   improvement in the overall energy efficiency and the reduction of the
   total losses.},

Abstract = {Manual grasping is widespread among tetrapods but is more prominent and
   dexterous in primates. Whether the selective pressures that drove the
   evolution of dexterous hand grasping involved the collection of fruit or
   predation on mobile insects remains an area of debate. One way to
   explore this question is to examine preferences for manual versus oral
   grasping of a moving object. Previous studies on strepsirrhines have
   shown a preference for oral grasping when grasping static food items and
   a preference for manual grasping when grasping mobile prey such as
   insects, but little is known about the factors at play. Using a
   controlled experiment with a simple and predictable motion of a food
   item, we tested and compared the grasping behaviours of 53 captive
   individuals belonging to 17 species of strepsirrhines while grasping
   swinging food items and static food items. The swinging motion increased
   the frequency of hand-use for all individuals. Our results provide
   evidence that the swinging motion of the food is a sufficient parameter
   to increase hand grasping in a wide variety of strepsirrhine primates.
   From an evolutionary perspective, this result gives some support to the
   idea that hand-grasping abilities evolved under selective pressure
   associated with the predation of food items in motion. Looking at a
   common grasping pattern across a large set of species, this study
   provides important insight into comparative approaches to understanding
   the evolution of the hand grasping of food in primates and potentially
   other tetrapod taxa.},

Title = {Does the shape of forelimb long bones co-vary with grasping behaviour in

Abstract = {Fine prehensile activities are often thought to have been associated
   with the evolution of the human hand. However, there has been no
   holistic approach establishing the link between the morphology of the
   forelimb and grasping ability in living primates. The present study
   investigated the possible relationships between grasping behaviour and
   the morphology of the forelimb in strepsirrhines in a phylogenetic
   context. To do so, grasping behaviour during feeding and the shape of
   the long bones of the forelimb were analysed for 22 species of
   strepsirrhines. The data obtained show that there is a phylogenetic
   signal in forelimb morphology in primates in relation to grasping
   behaviour, but also that there is a marked co-evolution between grasping
   behaviour and the shape of the humerus and radius. This latter finding
   suggests a functional association between grasping and forelimb shape,
   which in turn suggests that bone shape constrains or facilitates
   behaviour. This result may permit future inferences to be made regarding
   this behaviour in extinct species and deserves further examination in
   more detail.},

Abstract = {Although hand grasping is ubiquitous in primate species, its origins
   remain uncertain. This is in part because uncertainty about hand skills
   and grasping strategies persists in strepsirrhines, a monophyletic group
   of primates located near the base of the primate tree. In this study, we
   report and discuss our observations of the different grasping strategies
   adopted by 85 captive individuals belonging to 22 species of
   strepsirrhines during the grasping of food items of different sizes and
   consistencies. Our results indicate that although strepsirrhines do not
   present variability in their hand-grip types (sole whole-hand power
   grip), they are able to adjust their grasping strategy depending on the
   properties of the food. Notably, they use the mouth when more precision
   is needed (i.e. to grasp small items). Moreover, grasping strategies
   adopted for big items differ depending on food consistency, revealing a
   new and potentially essential factor to consider in future research on
   grasping abilities. We believe that by looking across this important set
   of species in unconstrained standardized conditions, this study provides
   valuable insight for further comparative research on the potential
   selective pressures involved in the evolution of hand grasping.},

   with immunohistochemical labelling for cytokeratin 7. A third aye-aye
   suffering from dental disease was diagnosed with an oral squamous cell
   carcinoma following an excisional biopsy from a non-healing wound in the
   lip. Due to progression of the neoplasia the animal was humanely
   destroyed and post-mortem examination revealed the presence on an

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel collision avoidance system for autonomous
   vehicles based on overtaking procedures. The proposed Overtaking
   Procedure for Collision Avoidance Systems (OP-CAS) takes a behavioral
   cloning-based approach which uses images obtained out of a low cost
   monocular camera. The algorithm selectively records the expert's
   corrective driving behavior during data collection. This is performed
   recording oscillatory driving behavior when the vehicle is returning to
   the center of the lane. This data augmentation method addresses the
   issue of covariate shift commonly found in behavioral cloning methods.
   This approach is computationally inexpensive, making it a viable option
   for real time embedded deployment. A feasibility study was performed
   with two remotely controlled scaled vehicles as a proof of concept.
   Results showed that when two expert drivers demonstrated overtaking
   behaviors for data collection, even a small dataset was sufficient to
   model the overtaking sequence. The overtaking maneuvers were deployed in
   real time on 1/8th scale RC platforms, validating OP-CAS for civilian
   vehicle safety applications.},

Abstract = {In Euclidian terms {[}5], a border is a line dividing elements that meet
   specific requirements to the ones that do not. However, under the
   biological perspective the border is inferred as the space on
   interchanges are intensified and where influences among realities
   emerge. Thus, while can be interpreted as a limit that isolates and
   segregates, we rather consider any border as a catalyst that multiplies
   interrelations over a permeable and porous field(1). In the architecture
   discipline it is possible to identify areas that have been understood as
   evident borders: scales, age ranges, professors and students
   relationship, being - no matter their interdependence-particularly
   relevant the separation set between the architecture project design and
   urbanism.
   Through 3 years of teaching based research in the course of Architecture
   Design and Urbanism (Projectes i Urbanisme) at the Reus Architecture
   School (ETSAR) it has been the endeavour to overcome the borders, both
   disciplinary and methodologically, working under marginal conditions,
   from the questions stated to the course program and the established
   working environments. As a teaching tool and fresh statement, the
   decision was to work under the conception of a hybrid environment in
   constant change, able to provide to students a holistic outlook to our
   conception of a multi-faceted urban reality. Workshops were made to
   empower students' leadership, autonomy and development driven by
   cross-sectional teaching and collaborative exercises. A methodology that
   required of the contribution of professionals of social and urban
   sciences, academics and local technicians who actively participated at
   different work stages of the course providing sharp insights onto the
   discussed and revealed topics going from economy to geography and
   anthropology.
   That being said, the main goal of the course was to recognize the
   territory and the city like a single complex ecosystem of
   interdependencies between collective wills, private interests, economic
   developments, political interests, social problems, technological
   improvements, climate risks and ecological potentials, that demands for
   a cross-scale focus and a cross-sectional study. A city was conceived as
   a collective construction that relies in society as one of the
   mechanisms to transform our living places and the landscapes we dwell
   in.
   This paper aims to sum up the experience gained through three years of
   academic work on the limits of the urban disciplines. By explaining the
   developed learning by doing process, we would like to highlight some of
   the results achieved, and the techniques implemented. Moreover,
   reorganization of the hypothesis, exercises, and works has been
   synthesized in form of handbook. A document that will be finally shaped
   as a digital open source tool able to improve cross interaction between
   students, professors and researchers from disciplines related to the
   urban environment. In other words, we propose a proactive tool to
   strengthen an integral approach to cities and territories through
   collaborative development among schools and disciplines hoping to happen
   an open and useful academic source.},

Title = {Island-wide aridity did not trigger recent megafaunal extinctions in

Abstract = {Researchers are divided about the relative importance of people versus
   climate in triggering the Late Holocene extinctions of the endemic
   large-bodied fauna on the island of Madagascar. Specifically, a dramatic
   and synchronous decline in arboreal pollen and increase in grass pollen
   ca 1000 yr ago has been alternatively interpreted as evidence for
   aridification, increased human activity, or both. As aridification and
   anthropogenic deforestation can have similar effects on vegetation,
   resolving which of these factors (if either) led to the demise of the
   megafauna on Madagascar has remained a challenge. We use stable nitrogen
   isotope (delta N-15) values from radiocarbon-dated subfossil vertebrates
   to disentangle the relative importance of natural and human-induced
   changes. If increasing aridity were responsible for megafaunal decline,
   then we would expect an island-wide increase in delta N-15 values
   culminating in the highest values at the time of proposed maximum
   drought at ca 1000 yr ago. Alternatively, if climate were relatively
   stable and anthropogenic habitat alteration explains the palynological
   signal, then we would anticipate little or no change in habitat
   moisture, and no systematic, directional change in delta N-15 values
   over time. After accounting for the confounding influences of diet,
   geographic region, and coastal proximity, we find no change in delta
   N-15 values over the past 10 000 yr, and no support for a period of
   marked, geographically widespread aridification culminating 900-950 yr
   ago. Instead, increases in grasses at around that time may signal a
   transition in human land use to a more dedicated agro-pastoralist
   lifestyle, when megafaunal populations were already in decline. Land use
   changes ca 1000 yr ago would have simply accelerated the inevitable loss
   of Madagascar's megafauna.},

Abstract = {The spiny forest of South Madagascar is one of the driest and most
   unpredictable habitats in Africa. The small-bodied, nocturnal primate
   Lepilemur leucopus lives in this harsh habitat with high diurnal and
   seasonal changes in ambient temperature. In this study, we investigated
   seasonal adaptions in energy budgeting of L. leucopus, which allow it to
   live under these conditions by measuring resting metabolic rate using
   open-flow respirometry. No signs of heterothermy were detected, and
   resting metabolic rate was significantly lower in the warmer wet season
   than in the colder dry season. In fact, L. leucopus possesses one of the
   lowest mass-specific metabolic rates measured so far for an endotherm,
   probably the result of adaptations to its habitat and folivorous and
   potentially toxic diet. Surprisingly, we identified a shift of the
   thermoneutral zone from between 25 and 30 A degrees C in the wet season
   to between 29 and 32 A degrees C in the cool dry season. L. leucopus
   seems to be more affected by the hot daytime temperatures during the dry
   season and thermoregulation seems to be more costly during this time,
   which makes this shift of the thermoneutral zone advantageous. Our
   findings suggest that L. leucopus has a very small scope to unfavorable
   conditions, making it highly vulnerable, e.g., to changing conditions
   due to climate change.},

Abstract = {It is hypothesized that retrotransposons have played a fundamental role
   in primate evolution and that enhanced neurologic retrotransposon
   activity in humans may underlie the origin of higher cognitive function.
   As a potential consequence of this enhanced activity, it is likely that
   neurons are susceptible to deleterious retrotransposon pathways that can
   disrupt mitochondrial function. An example is observed in the TOMM40
   gene, encoding a beta-barrel protein critical for mitochondrial
   preprotein transport. Primate-specific Alu retrotransposons have
   repeatedly inserted into TOMM40 introns, and at least one variant
   associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease originated from an Alu
   insertion event. We provide evidence of enriched Alu content in
   mitochondrial genes and postulate that Alus can disrupt mitochondrial
   populations in neurons, thereby setting the stage for progressive
   neurologic dysfunction. This Alu neurodegeneration hypothesis is
   compatible with decades of research and offers a plausible mechanism for
   the disruption of neuronal mitochondrial homeostasis, ultimately
   cascading into neurodegenerative disease. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Number = {6},
Pages = {1146-1153},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Males in many species compete intensely for access to females. In order
   to minimize costly interactions, they can assess their rivals'
   competitive abilities by evaluating traits and behaviors. We know little
   about how males selectively direct their attention to make these
   assessments. Using Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus) as a model system, we
   examined how males visually assess their competitors by continuously
   tracking the gaze of freely moving peacocks during the mating season.
   When assessing rivals, peacocks selectively gazed toward the lower
   display regions of their rivals, including the lower eyespot and
   fishtail feathers, dense feathers, body and wings. Their attention was
   modified based on the rivals' behavior such that they spent more time
   looking at rivals when rivals were shaking their wings and moving. The
   results indicate that peacocks selectively allocate their attention
   during rival assessment. The gaze patterns of males assessing rivals
   were largely similar to those of females evaluating mates, suggesting
   that some male traits serve a dual function in both intra- and
   intersexual selection. However, males spent more time than females
   looking at the upper eyespots and this could indicate that the upper
   eyespots function more in close- up rival assessment than mate choice.},

Title = {33 million year old Myotis (Chiroptera, Vespertilionidae) and the rapid
   global radiation of modern bats},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {The bat genus Myotis is represented by 120+ living species and 40+
   extinct species and is found on every continent except Antarctica. The
   time of divergence of Myotis has been contentious as has the time and
   place of origin of its encompassing group the Vespertilionidae, the most
   diverse (450+ species) and widely distributed extant bat family. Fossil
   Myotis species are common, especially in Europe, beginning in the
   Miocene but earlier records are poor. Recent study of new specimens from
   the Belgian early Oligocene locality of Boutersem reveals the presence
   of a relatively large vespertilionid. Morphological comparison and
   phylogenetic analysis confirms that the new, large form can be
   confidently assigned to the genus Myotis, making this record the
   earliest known for that taxon and extending the temporal range of this
   extant genus to over 33 million years. This suggests that previously
   published molecular divergence dates for crown myotines (Myotis) are too
   young by at least 7 million years. Additionally, examination of first
   fossil appearance data of 1,011 extant placental mammal genera indicates
   that only 13 first occurred in the middle to late Paleogene (48 to 33
   million years ago) and of these, six represent bats, including Myotis.
   Paleogene members of both major suborders of Chiroptera (Yangochiroptera
   and Yinpterochiroptera) include extant genera indicating early
   establishment of successful and long-term adaptive strategies as bats
   underwent an explosive radiation near the beginning of the Early Eocene
   Climatic Optimum in the Old World. A second bat adaptive radiation in
   the New World began coincident with the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum.},

Title = {Tracing a toad invasion: lack of mitochondrial DNA variation, haplotype
   origins, and potential distribution of introduced Duttaphrynus
   melanostictus in Madagascar},
Journal = {AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {197-207},
Abstract = {The black-spined toad, Duttaphrynus melanostictus, is widespread in
   South and South-East (SE) Asia, although recent molecular analyses have
   revealed that it represents a species complex (here called the D.
   melanostictus complex). Invasive populations of this toad have been
   detected in Madagascar since, at least, 2014. We here trace the origin
   of this introduction based on mitochondrial DNA sequences of 340
   samples. All 102 specimens from Madagascar have identical sequences
   pointing to a single introduction event. Their haplotype corresponds to
   a lineage occurring in Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and
   some locations of eastern Myanmar and northern Malaysia, here named the
   SE Asian lineage. Within this lineage, specimens from one location in
   Cambodia and three locations in Vietnam have the same haplotype as found
   in Madagascar. This includes Ho Chi Minh City, which has a major seaport
   and might have been the source for the introduction. Species
   distribution models suggest that the current range of the Madagascan
   invasive population is within the bioclimatic space occupied by the SE
   Asian lineage in its native range. The potential invasion zone in
   Madagascar is narrower than suggested by models from localities
   representing the full range of the D. melanostictus complex. Thus, an
   accurate taxonomy is essential for such inferences, but it remains
   uncertain if the toad might be able to spread beyond the potential
   suitable range because (1) knowledge on species-delimitation of the
   complex is insufficient, and (2) the native range in SE Asia might be
   influenced by historical biogeography or competition.},

Title = {Deciduous dentition and dental eruption sequence of Bothriogenys fraasi
   (Anthracotheriidae, Artiodactyla) from the Fayum Depression, Egypt},
Journal = {PALAEONTOLOGIA ELECTRONICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Paleogene anthracotheres are poorly documented from Afro-Arabian
   localities. This is due, in large part, to the fragmentary nature of the
   specimens that have been described. However, sediments in the Jebel
   Qatrani Formation, Fayum Depression, Egypt, preserve the richest
   anthracothere assemblage in all of Afro-Arabia. Unlike other samples,
   the Fayum collection includes many complete dentitions, skulls, and
   partial skeletons. Based on these extensive collections, this study
   provides the first description of the complete deciduous dentition and
   dental eruption sequence for the early Oligocene anthracothere
   Bothriogenys fraasi. A detailed discussion concerning the pattern and
   timing of dental growth in B. fraasi is provided, and the ontogenetic
   sequence documented for B. fraasi is compared with those available for
   suoids and hippos, the two extant groups currently considered as
   possible sister taxa to anthracotheres. Results show that anthracotheres
   and suoids share a more similar dental emergence pattern, and one that
   may be close to the primitive condition for artiodactyls, while hippos
   have a very different dental eruption sequence as a consequence of their
   highly divergent life history pattern. As a growing body of life history
   research indicates that taxa in close phylogenetic proximity may be
   expected to share features of their dental developmental pattern, this
   finding suggests a useful test of competing hypotheses of a relationship
   between Anthracotheriidae and either Hippopotamidae or Suiformes can
   potentially be developed based on eruption patterns.},

Abstract = {Animals selectively direct their visual attention toward relevant
   aspects of their environments. They can shift their attention using a
   combination of eye, head and body movements. While we have a growing
   understanding of eye and head movements in mammals, we know little about
   these processes in birds. We therefore measured the eye and head
   movements of freely behaving Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus) using a
   telemetric eye-tracker. Both eye and head movements contributed to gaze
   changes in peafowl. When gaze shifts were smaller, eye movements played
   a larger role than when gaze shifts were larger. The duration and
   velocity of eye and head movements were positively related to the size
   of the eye and head movements, respectively. In addition, the
   coordination of eye and head movements in peafowl differed from that in
   mammals; peafowl exhibited a near-absence of the vestibulo-ocular
   reflex, which may partly result from the peafowl's ability to move their
   heads as quickly as their eyes.},

Title = {Sex, social status and physiological stress in primates: the importance

Journal = {PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {370},

Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Social status has been associated with health consequences, although the
   mechanisms by which status affects health are relatively unknown. At the
   physiological level, many studies have investigated the potential
   relationship between social behaviour/rank and physiological stress,
   with a particular focus on glucocorticoid (GC) production. GCs are of
   interest because of their experimentally established influence on
   health-related processes such as metabolism and immune function. Studies
   in a variety of species, in both naturalistic and laboratory settings,
   have led to complex outcomes. This paper reviews findings from primates
   and rodents and proposes a psychologically and physiologically relevant
   framework in which to study the relationship between social status and
   GC function. We (i) compare status-specific GC production between male
   and female primates, (ii) review the functional significance of
   different temporal patterns of GC production, (iii) propose ways to
   assess these temporal dynamics, and (iv) present novel hypotheses about
   the relationship between social status and GC temporal dynamics, and
   potential fitness and health implications. To understand whether GC
   production mediates social status-related fitness disparities, we must
   consider social contest conditions and the temporal dynamics of GC
   production. This framework will provide greater insights into the
   relationship between social status, physiological stress and health.},

Title = {Indoor Positioning Using Efficient Map Matching, RSS Measurements, and
   an Improved Motion Model},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Unlike outdoor positioning, there is no unique solution to obtain the
   position of a person inside a building or in Global Navigation Satellite
   System (GNSS)-denied areas. Typical implementations indoor rely on dead
   reckoning or beacon-based positioning, but a robust estimation must
   combine several techniques to overcome their own drawbacks. In this
   paper, we present an indoor positioning system based on foot-mounted
   pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) with an efficient map matching, received
   signal strength (RSS) measurements, and an improved motion model that
   includes the estimation of the turn rate bias. The system was
   implemented using a two-level structure with a low-level PDR filter and
   a high-level particle filter (PF) to include all the measurements. After
   studying the effect of the step displacement on the PFs proposed in the
   literature, we concluded that a new state with the turn rate bias (a
   nonobservable state in PDR) is needed to correctly estimate the error
   growth and, in the long term, correct the position and heading
   estimation. Additionally, the wall crossing detection of map matching
   was optimized as matrix operations, and a room grouping algorithm was
   proposed as a way to accelerate the process, achieving real-time
   execution with more than 100 000 particles in a building with more than
   600 wall segments. We also include a basic path-loss model to use RSS
   measurements that allows a better initialization of the filter, fewer
   particles, and faster convergence, without the need for an extensive
   calibration. The inclusion of the map matching algorithm lowers the
   error level of the RSS-PDR positioning, from 1.9 to 0.75 m, 90\% of the
   time. The system is tested in several trajectories to show the
   improvement in the estimated positioning, the time to convergence, and
   the required number of particles.},

Abstract = {Prior research has shown that the use of apes, specifically chimpanzees,
   as performers in the media negatively impacts public attitudes of their
   conservation status and desirability as a pet, yet it is unclear whether
   these findings generalize to other non-human primates (specifically
   non-ape species). We evaluated the impact of viewing an image of a
   monkey or prosimian in an anthropomorphic or naturalistic setting,
   either in contact with or in the absence of a human. Viewing the primate
   in an anthropomorphic setting while in contact with a person
   significantly increased their desirability as a pet, which also
   correlated with increased likelihood of believing the animal was not
   endangered. The majority of viewers felt that the primates in all tested
   images were ``nervous.{''} When shown in contact with a human, viewers
   felt they were ``sad{''} and ``scared{''}, while also being less
   ``funny.{''} Our findings highlight the potential broader implications
   of the use of non-human primate performers by the entertainment
   industry.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a digital filter for the generation/correlation of binary
   Golay pairs of sequences of length 2(N) . 10(M) . 26(P) (N, M and P are
   non-negative integers) is proposed. It is carried out by means of a
   novel Golay kernel 26 decomposition, also introduced in this paper,
   combined with building blocks of Golay kernels 2 and 10, presented in
   previous works. The proposed filter has a similar architecture to the
   digital filter for the generation/correlation of Golay multilevel pairs
   of sequences, where the parameters at intermediate stages have to be
   adjusted to obtain Golay binary pairs of sequences in the final stage.

Abstract = {The early Miocene site of Wadi Moghra, Qattara Depression, Egypt, is
   important for interpreting anthracothere (Mammalia, Artiodactyla)
   evolution, because the Moghra sediments preserve a higher diversity of
   anthracotheres than any other pene-contemporaneous site. New specimens
   from Moghra are described and form the basis for the systematic revision
   of Moghra anthracotheres provided here. Among the important discoveries
   recently made at Moghra is the first complete skull of Sivameryx moneyi.
   Other new specimens described here include two new species of Afromeryx,
   and a new genus and species, all of which are unique to Moghra. A review
   of biogeographic information supports the conclusion that three of the
   Moghra anthracotheres (Brachyodus depereti, B. mogharensis, and
   Jaggermeryx naida, n. gen. n. sp.) are members of late surviving
   lineages with a long history in Africa, while three other species
   (Afromeryx grex, n. sp., A. palustris, n. sp., and Sivameryx moneyi)
   represent more recent immigrants from Eurasia.},

Title = {Selective attention in peacocks during predator detection},
Journal = {ANIMAL COGNITION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {767-777},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Predation can exert strong selective pressure on the evolution of
   behavioral and morphological traits in birds. Because predator avoidance
   is key to survival and birds rely heavily on visual perception,
   predation may have shaped avian visual systems as well. To address this
   question, we examined the role of visual attention in antipredator
   behavior in peacocks (Pavo cristatus). Peacocks were exposed to a model
   predator while their gaze was continuously recorded with a telemetric
   eye-tracker. We found that peacocks spent more time looking at and made
   more fixations on the predator compared to the same spatial location
   before the predator was revealed. The duration of fixations they
   directed toward conspecifics and environmental features decreased after
   the predator was revealed, indicating that the peacocks were rapidly
   scanning their environment with their eyes. Maximum eye movement
   amplitudes and amplitudes of consecutive saccades were similar before
   and after the predator was revealed. In cases where conspecifics
   detected the predator first, peacocks appeared to learn that danger was
   present by observing conspecifics' antipredator behavior. Peacocks were
   faster to detect the predator when they were fixating closer to the area
   where the predator would eventually appear. In addition, pupil size
   increased after predator exposure, consistent with increased
   physiological arousal. These findings demonstrate that peacocks
   selectively direct their attention toward predatory threats and suggest
   that predation has influenced the evolution of visual orienting systems.},

Title = {Improving Inertial Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning by Detecting Unmodified

Abstract = {This paper explores how inertial Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning (PDR)
   location systems can be improved with the use of a light sensor to
   measure the illumination gradients created when a person walks under
   ceiling-mounted unmodified indoor lights. The process of updating the
   inertial PDR estimates with the information provided by light detections
   is a new concept that we have named Light-matching (LM). The
   displacement and orientation change of a person obtained by inertial PDR
   is used by the LM method to accurately propagate the location
   hypothesis, and vice versa; the LM approach benefits the PDR approach by
   obtaining an absolute localization and reducing the PDR-alone drift.
   Even from an initially unknown location and orientation, whenever the
   person passes below a switched-on light spot, the location likelihood is
   iteratively updated until it potentially converges to a unimodal
   probability density function. The time to converge to a unimodal
   position hypothesis depends on the number of lights detected and the
   asymmetries/irregularities of the spatial distribution of lights. The
   proposed LM method does not require any intensity illumination
   calibration, just the pre-storage of the position and size of all lights
   in a building, irrespective of their current on/off state. This paper
   presents a detailed description of the light-matching concept, the
   implementation details of the LM-assisted PDR fusion scheme using a
   particle filter, and several simulated and experimental tests, using a
   light sensor-equipped Galaxy S3 smartphone and an external foot-mounted
   inertial sensor. The evaluation includes the LM-assisted PDR approach as
   well as the fusion with other signals of opportunity (WiFi, RFID,
   Magnetometers or Map-matching) in order to compare their contribution in
   obtaining high accuracy indoor localization. The integrated solution
   achieves a localization error lower than 1 m in most of the cases.},

Title = {Pedestrian navigation fusing inertial and RSS/TOF measurements with
   adaptive movement/measurement models: Experimental evaluation and
   theoretical limits},
Journal = {SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {A common approach for advanced Indoor Localization systems is the fusion
   of complementary techniques, such as inertial navigation systems like
   pedestrian dead-reckoning (PDR) and absolute measurement methods like
   radio-frequency (RF) beacon-based positioning. Although this fusion
   approach provides accurate drift-free absolute positioning, the best
   results are only obtained if the techniques are adapted to each
   environment and user. This requires a previous campaign of building
   calibration and movement model estimation that will be specific to the
   place and person. In this paper, we tackle this problem by presenting a
   real-time pedestrian navigation system that fuses PDR and RF
   beacon-based strategies using a flexible particle filter (PF)
   implementation, with the following innovative aspects: (1) the
   definition of an adaptive stride movement model valid for different
   walking styles, which is used in the PF prediction stage; (2) the
   dynamic estimation of the measurements model from real-time Received
   Signal Strength (RSS) and Time of Flight (TOF) values, which is used in
   the PF update stage; (3) the tracking of the person's position without
   an initial position/heading nor specific calibration. Additionally, we
   have obtained the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for our fusion-based
   approach, in order to assess rigorously the performance of the
   positioning accuracy. We have tested the system in a building fusing PDR
   with TOF and RSS values coming from WiFi access points or ZigBee nodes.
   For trajectories with a total length of approximately 1000 m we obtained
   an error of less than 1.75 m for 90\% of the total path length, with
   both systems. The empirical results match closely the CRLB, showing that
   our system performs close to the theoretical limit. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Pages = {3035-3046},

Abstract = {Conspicuous, multicomponent ornamentation in male animals can be favored
   by female mate choice but we know little about the cognitive processes
   females use to evaluate these traits. Sexual selection may favor
   attention mechanisms allowing the choosing females to selectively and
   efficiently acquire relevant information from complex male display
   traits and, in turn, may favor male display traits that effectively
   capture and hold female attention. Using a miniaturized telemetric
   gaze-tracker, we show that peahens (Pavo cristatus) selectively attend
   to specific components of peacock courtship displays and virtually
   ignore other, highly conspicuous components. Females gazed at the lower
   train but largely ignored the head, crest and upper train. When the
   lower train was obscured, however, females spent more time gazing at the
   upper train and approached the upper train from a distance. Our results
   suggest that peahens mainly evaluate the lower train during close-up
   courtship but use the upper train as a long-distance attraction signal.
   Furthermore, we found that behavioral display components (train rattling
   and wing shaking) captured and maintained female attention, indicating
   that interactions between display components may promote the evolution
   of multicomponent displays. Taken together, these findings suggest that
   selective attention plays a crucial role in sexual selection and likely
   influences the evolution of male display traits.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the design of a novel receiver for a broadband
   ultrasonic Local Positioning System (LPS). As in other devices based on
   matched filtering of the transmitted encoded signals, this receiver
   features high robustness to noise and multiple access capability. Unlike
   previous solutions, the proposed receiver is capable of detecting
   beacons emissions despite being installed in a fast moving device, and
   it also provides estimation of its velocity. The system has been
   implemented in an FPGA-based architecture. An experimental analysis of
   performance has been carried out. Firstly using a set of test signals
   synthetically generated to simulate different positions and velocities
   of the receiver. Secondly, a set of real signals obtained with a
   prototype have been used. The simulated results show the capability of
   the system to detect the encoded signals emitted by the LPS
   infrastructure when the device is moving at velocities of up to 3 m/s
   under low SNR conditions. The real results confirm the improved system
   capability, but also make evident the negative influence that phenomena
   such as the transducers response and multipath propagation can have on
   system performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a new architecture for the correlation of orthogonal
   complementary sets of sequences (OCSS) and their performance in an
   ultrasonic local positioning system (U-LPS). OCSS are sets of sequences
   whose addition of correlation functions has ideal properties, that makes
   interference-free code-division multiple access (CDMA) possible. They
   can be used to encode the signals emitted by a CDMAbased U-LPS,
   enhancing the performance of such systems in terms of immunity against
   noise, multipath propagation, and near-far effect. Also, the
   orthogonality of the codes offers an operation resistance to multiaccess
   interference, which endows the U-LPS with the capability of simultaneous
   emission from different beacons. On the other hand, the detection of
   OCSS codes can be performed by means of efficient algorithms. This paper
   presents an optimization of previous proposals allowing the simultaneous
   correlation of OCSS by using fewer operations and memory elements.
   Furthermore, the hardware implementation of the proposed optimization is
   also addressed, and an U-LPS based on this proposal is presented.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the problem of determining the position of beacon
   nodes in Local Positioning Systems (LPSs), for which there are no
   inter-beacon distance measurements available and neither the mobile node
   nor any of the stationary nodes have positioning or odometry
   information. The common solution is implemented using a mobile node
   capable of measuring its distance to the stationary beacon nodes within
   a sensing radius. Many authors have implemented heuristic methods based
   on optimization algorithms to solve the problem. However, such methods
   require a good initial estimation of the node positions in order to find
   the correct solution. In this paper we present a new method to calculate
   the inter-beacon distances, and hence the beacons positions, based in
   the linearization of the trilateration equations into a closed-form
   solution which does not require any approximate initial estimation. The
   simulations and field evaluations show a good estimation of the beacon
   node positions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The structure and function of primate communication have attracted much
   attention, and vocal signals, in particular, have been studied in
   detail. As a general rule, larger social groups emit more types of vocal
   signals, including those conveying the presence of specific types of
   predators. The adaptive advantages of receiving and responding to alarm
   calls are expected to exert a selective pressure on the auditory system.
   Yet, the comparative biology of primate hearing is limited to select
   species, and little attention has been paid to the effects of social and
   vocal complexity on hearing. Here, we use the auditory brainstem
   response method to generate the largest number of standardized
   audiograms available for any primate radiation. We compared the auditory
   sensitivities of 11 strepsirrhine species with and without independent
   contrasts and show that social complexity explains a significant amount
   of variation in two audiometric parameters-overall sensitivity and
   high-frequency limit. We verified the generality of this latter result
   by augmenting our analysis with published data from nine species
   spanning the primate order. To account for these findings, we develop
   and test a model of social drive. We hypothesize that social complexity
   has favoured enhanced hearing sensitivities, especially at higher
   frequencies.},

Abstract = {The dynamic and unpredictable characteristics of wireless channels in
   harsh environments have resulted in a poor performance of localization
   systems. Conventional implementations rely on unrealistic assumptions
   driven by tractability requirements, such as linear models or Gaussian
   errors. In this paper, we present a framework for data fusion in
   localization systems based on determining likelihood functions that
   represent the relationship between measurements and distances. In this
   framework, such likelihoods are dynamically adapted to the propagation
   conditions. The subsequent usage of a particle filter (PF) leads to an
   adaptive likelihood particle (ALPA) filter that addresses the nonlinear
   and non-Gaussian behavior of measurements over time. The ALPA filter's
   performance is quantified by using received-signal-strength (RSS) and
   time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements collected with wireless local area
   network (WLAN) devices. We compare the accuracy obtained to the accuracy
   of conventional implementations and to the posterior Cramer-Rao lower
   bound (PCRLB). Both empirical and simulation results show that the
   proposed ALPA filter significantly improves the accuracy of conventional
   approaches, obtaining an error close to the PCRLB.},

Abstract = {The Linearized Auto-Localization (LAL) algorithm estimates the position
   of beacon nodes in Local Positioning Systems (LPSs), using only the
   distance measurements to a mobile node whose position is also unknown.
   The LAL algorithm calculates the inter-beacon distances, used for the
   estimation of the beacons' positions, from the linearized trilateration
   equations. In this paper we propose a method to estimate the propagation
   of the errors of the inter-beacon distances obtained with the LAL
   algorithm, based on a first order Taylor approximation of the equations.
   Since the method depends on such approximation, a confidence parameter
   tau is defined to measure the reliability of the estimated error. Field
   evaluations showed that by applying this information to an improved
   weighted-based auto-localization algorithm (WLAL), the standard
   deviation of the inter-beacon distances can be improved by more than
   30\% on average with respect to the original LAL method.},

Abstract = {Existing indoor navigation solutions for pedestrian complement Global
   Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in GNSS-compromised areas. Recently,
   these solutions rely on pre-installed wireless sensor networks (WSN)
   where received signal strength (RSS) based techniques are the most
   spread due to their availability and cost. However, neither of the RSS
   based positioning techniques take into account the shadow effect of the
   human body who carries the RSS meter since the presence of the human
   body alters the pattern of wave propagation in its immediate proximity.
   In this paper, we assess the human shadow effect in a theoretical
   approach based on the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to
   weight the RSS information that feeds inertial navigation system (INS)

Title = {CRANIAL MORPHOLOGY OF THYROHYRAX DOMORICTUS (MAMMALIA, HYRACOIDEA) FROM
   THE EARLY OLIGOCENE OF EGYPT},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {32},

Pages = {166-179},
Abstract = {The Jebel Qatrani Formation in the Fayum Depression, Egypt, has yielded
   a diverse hyracoid fauna that includes both small-and large-bodied
   forms. Thyrohyrax domorictus is one of themost common hyracoids found in
   the upper sequence of the Formation, from sites dating to between 29 and
   31 Ma. The dental morphology of T. domorictus is more similar to that of
   living hyraxes than other Paleogene species, but additional
   morphological evidence is needed to test the hypothesis of procaviid
   affinities. Two fairly complete crania of T. domorictus are now known
   and provide a number of additional craniofacial characters for
   phylogenetic analysis. The specimens are comparable in size to other
   small-bodied Fayum hyracoids and extant procaviids. T. domorictus has a
   relatively long rostrum that is perforated by a nasomaxillary fossa,
   which is also present in Miocene Afrohyrax and Prohyrax and older
   Thyrohyrax pygmaeus. The anterior border of the orbit is positioned
   above the molars, and the orbital aperture is closed posteriorly by a
   complete postorbital bar. Compared to other Fayum hyracoids, T.
   domorictus exhibits relatively derived, and more procaviid-like, cranial
   morphology. The cranium of T. domorictus is most similar to that of the
   extant genus Dendrohyrax, and they share similar morphology of the orbit
   and cranial roof. Phylogenetic analysis including morphological and
   molecular data from a large sample of living and extinct afrotherians
   places Thyrohyrax domorictus as the closest known Paleogene relative of
   Procaviidae and Pliohyracidae, supporting the hypothesis of procaviid
   affinities that was originally proposed solely on the basis of dental
   morphology.},

Title = {Improved heuristic drift elimination with magnetically-aided dominant
   directions (MiHDE) for pedestrian navigation in complex buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LOCATION BASED SERVICES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {186-210},
Abstract = {The main problem of pedestrian dead-reckoning (PDR) using only a
   body-attached inertial measurement unit is the accumulation of heading
   errors. The heading provided by magnetometers in indoor buildings is in
   general not reliable and therefore it is commonly not used. Recently, a
   new method was proposed called heuristic drift elimination (HDE) that
   minimises the heading error when navigating in buildings. It assumes
   that the majority of buildings have their corridors parallel to each
   other, or they intersect at right angles, and consequently most of the
   time the person walks along a straight path with a heading constrained
   to one of the four possible directions. In this article we study the
   performance of HDE-based methods in complex buildings, i.e. with
   pathways also oriented at 45(circle), long curved corridors, and wide
   areas where non-oriented motion is possible. We explain how the
   performance of the original HDE method can be deteriorated in complex
   buildings, and also, how severe errors can appear in the case of false
   matches with the building's dominant directions. Although magnetic
   compassing indoors has a chaotic behaviour, in this article we analyse
   large data-sets in order to study the potential use that magnetic
   compassing has to estimate the absolute yaw angle of a walking person.
   Apart from these analysis, this article also proposes an improved HDE
   method called Magnetically-aided Improved Heuristic Drift Elimination
   (MiHDE), that is implemented over a PDR framework that uses foot-mounted
   inertial navigation with an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The EKF is fed
   with the MiHDE-estimated orientation error, gyro bias corrections, as
   well as the confidence over that corrections. We experimentally
   evaluated the performance of the proposed MiHDE-based PDR method,
   comparing it with the original HDE implementation. Results show that
   both methods perform very well in ideal orthogonal narrow-corridor
   buildings, and MiHDE outperforms HDE for non-ideal trajectories (e.g.
   curved paths) and also makes it robust against potential false dominant
   direction matchings.},

Title = {Accurate Pedestrian Indoor Navigation by Tightly Coupling Foot-Mounted

Abstract = {We present a new method to accurately locate persons indoors by fusing
   inertial navigation system (INS) techniques with active RFID technology.
   A foot-mounted inertial measuring units (IMUs)-based position estimation
   method, is aided by the received signal strengths (RSSs) obtained from
   several active RFID tags placed at known locations in a building. In
   contrast to other authors that integrate IMUs and RSS with a loose
   Kalman filter (KF)-based coupling (by using the residuals of inertial-
   and RSS-calculated positions), we present a tight KF-based INS/RFID
   integration, using the residuals between the INS-predicted reader-to-tag
   ranges and the ranges derived from a generic RSS path-loss model. Our
   approach also includes other drift reduction methods such as zero
   velocity updates (ZUPTs) at foot stance detections, zero angular-rate
   updates (ZARUs) when the user is motionless, and heading corrections
   using magnetometers. A complementary extended Kalman filter (EKF),
   throughout its 15-element error state vector, compensates the position,
   velocity and attitude errors of the INS solution, as well as IMU biases.
   This methodology is valid for any kind of motion (forward, lateral or
   backward walk, at different speeds), and does not require an offline
   calibration for the user gait. The integrated INS+RFID methodology
   eliminates the typical drift of IMU-alone solutions (approximately 1\%
   of the total traveled distance), resulting in typical positioning errors
   along the walking path (no matter its length) of approximately 1.5 m.},

Abstract = {The success of location-based services in open areas, mainly driven by
   Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), has pushed the research
   community towards the development of robust systems that provide a
   similar localization accuracy in harsh environments, where there is no
   line-of-sight (LOS) to satellites. Techniques based on time-of-arrival
   (TOA) measurements are the most promising since they can offer an
   appropriate balance between accuracy and complexity. However, their
   performance is commonly compromised by the knowledge of an accurate
   model relating TOA measurements and distance, which can involve an
   arduous task of calibration. In this paper, we present a method for
   real-time self-calibration of the model relating TOA and distance, based
   on TOA measurements exchanged among the anchors in the wireless network.
   Simulation and empirical results show the appropriateness of the derived
   models for a TOA-based localization system, since the obtained errors
   are remarkably close to the ones achieved with pre-calibrated
   parameters.},

Abstract = {Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning (PDR) and Radio Frequency (RF)
   ranging/positioning are complementary techniques for position estimation
   but they usually locate different points in the body (RF in the
   head/hand and PDR in the foot). We propose to fuse the information from
   both navigation points using a constraint filter with an upper bound in
   the distance between the estimated positions of both sensors.
   For a pedestrian with an IMU for PDR in the foot and a RF positioning
   system in the head, the simplest bound is a maximal distance of 2 m
   between the positions of the sensors, this establish a spherical limit
   to the difference in the positions. It is also possible to use a
   smaller, non-symmetrical bound that establishes an ellipsoid as the
   limit and improves the fusion. We propose the use of a grid of particles
   to approximate the mean and covariance of the states.
   We have tested the algorithm by processing data from an Ultra Wide Band
   (UWB) positioning sensor attached to an IMU, both placed on the helmet
   of a person, and a foot-mounted IMU. Our results show that the system is
   able to estimate the position of a person with a limited error growth
   for the dead reckoning system and a better position estimate between
   position updates for the UWB system.},

Abstract = {The localization of persons in indoor environments is nowadays an open
   problem. There are partial solutions based on the deployment of a
   network of sensors (Local Positioning Systems or LPS). Other solutions
   only require the installation of an inertial sensor on the person's body
   (Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning or PDR). PDR solutions integrate the signals
   coming from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which usually contains 3
   accelerometers and 3 gyroscopes. The main problem of PDR is the
   accumulation of positioning errors due to the drift caused by the noise
   in the sensors. This paper presents a PDR solution that incorporates a
   drift correction method based on detecting the access ramps usually
   found in buildings. The ramp correction method is implemented over a PDR
   framework that uses an Inertial Navigation algorithm (INS) and an IMU
   attached to the person's foot. Unlike other approaches that use external
   sensors to correct the drift error, we only use one IMU on the foot. To
   detect a ramp, the slope of the terrain on which the user is walking,
   and the change in height sensed when moving forward, are estimated from
   the IMU. After detection, the ramp is checked for association with one
   of the existing in a database. For each associated ramp, a position
   correction is fed into the Kalman Filter in order to refine the INS-PDR
   solution. Drift-free localization is achieved with positioning errors
   below 2 meters for 1,000-meter-long routes in a building with a few
   ramps.},

Title = {The Jaw Adductors of Strepsirrhines in Relation to Body Size, Diet, and

Abstract = {Body size and food properties account for much of the variation in the
   hard tissue morphology of the masticatory system whereas their influence
   on the soft tissue anatomy remains relatively understudied. Data on jaw
   adductor fiber architecture and experimentally determined ingested food
   size in a broad sample of 24 species of extant strepsirrhines allows us
   to evaluate several hypotheses about the influence of body size and diet
   on the masticatory muscles. Jaw adductor mass scales isometrically with
   body mass (beta = 0.99, r = 0.95), skull size (beta = 1.04, r = 0.97),
   and jaw length cubed (beta = 1.02, r = 0.95). Fiber length also scales
   isometrically with body mass (beta = 0.28, r = 0.85), skull size (beta =
   0.33, r = 0.84), and jaw length cubed (beta = 0.29, r = 0.88).
   Physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) scales with isometry or slight
   positive allometry with body mass (beta = 0.76, r = 0.92), skull size
   (beta = 0.78, r = 0.94), and jaw length cubed (beta = 0.78, r = 0.91).
   Whereas PCSA is isometric to body size estimates in frugivores, it is
   positively allometric in folivores. Independent of body size, fiber
   length is correlated with maximum ingested food size, suggesting that
   ingestive gape is related to fiber excursion. Comparisons of temporalis,
   masseter, and medial pterygoid PCSA in strepsirrhines of different diets
   suggest that there may be functional partitioning between these muscle
   groups. Anat Rec, 294:712-728, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {A refined chronology of prehistoric Madagascar and the demise of the

Abstract = {The vertebrate community of Madagascar is one of the most unique and
   diverse on Earth, yet faunal diversity today is just a fraction of that
   present in the Pleistocene and Early Holocene. An understanding of the
   chronology of extinction relative to climate change and anthropogenic
   factors is essential to test hypotheses for extinction. Here, I combine
   over 200 new radiocarbon dates with published C-14 dates from extinct
   and extant subfossil vertebrates. These new data provide evidence for
   the prolonged existence of both extant and extinct endemic terrestrial
   vertebrate species well before human arrival, with habitation of some
   localities extending back before the Last Glacial Maximum. I analyze the
   data for patterns among body sizes and ecoregions in relation to four
   major historical events: human arrival (ca 2500 years ago),
   establishment of human settlements (ca 1500 years ago), Late Holocene
   aridification (peaking ca 1000 years ago), and European arrival (ca 500
   years ago). Patterns in endemic species abundance after human arrival
   differ depending on body size and geographic location. Within the first
   500 years after human arrival, there were population declines in (1)
   very large species (> 150 kg) and large species (10-150 kg) in the Dry
   Deciduous Forest, (2) large species in the Central Highlands, and (3)
   very large species in the Spiny Thicket. This first pulse of declines
   was likely triggered by human predation. large species continued to be
   well represented in the Spiny Thicket and Succulent Woodland until ca
   1000 years ago, when their populations plummeted. This second pulse of
   declines may have been solely triggered by continued human predation, or
   it may have resulted from a combination of increasing Late Holocene
   aridity and human impacts in the form of hunting and habitat
   modification. The abundance of endemic animals weighing < 10 kg
   increased dramatically in the aftermath of the decline in large-bodied
   species. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {PALAEONTOLOGY},

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {A new genus and species of diminutive anomalurid rodent, Shazurus
   minutus, is described on the basis of 15 isolated teeth from the
   earliest late Eocene (approximately 37 Ma) Birket Qarun Locality 2 in
   the Fayum Depression of northern Egypt. Shazurus is surprisingly
   specialized for its age, being most similar in dental morphology to
   early Miocene Paranomalurus and extant Anomalurus, and is quite
   different from the roughly contemporaneous anomaluroid genera
   Nementchamys and Pondaungimys from Algeria and Myanmar, respectively.
   Parsimony analysis of dental features places Shazurus within crown
   Anomaluridae as a sister group of two species of Paranomalurus to the
   exclusion of extant Anomalurus and Idiurus. The marked morphological
   differences between the two oldest Afro-Arabian anomaluroids (Shazurus
   and Nementchamys) suggest that the taxa share a much more ancient common
   Afro-Arabian ancestor, possibly derived from Zegdoumyidae. Isolated
   teeth of Shazurus and other Eocene anomaluroids reveal little about
   their palaeobiology, but the complete absence of Anomaluroidea from the
   younger ( late Eocene to early Oligocene) Jebel Qatrani Formation is
   presumably a reflection of environmental change through the late Eocene
   in northern Africa.},

Abstract = {Prior to the trilateration process, different sources of error disturb
   the range estimates in any localization system, especially in dense
   cluttered environments where the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) between the
   mobile user (MU) and the access points (AP) becomes the main problem.
   Common error mitigation approaches are based on linear or Gaussian
   assumptions that are not fulfilled in this kind of scenarios, such as
   indoor or dense urban outdoor areas. This paper points out the better
   performance of a round-trip time (RTT)-based localization system when
   combining a prior NLOS measurements correction (PNMC) method with
   particle RTT-only tracking, since hard decisions are only made in the
   last stage of the positioning process, and neither linear nor Gaussian
   models are assumed. The final performance leads to a reduction of more
   than 57\% of the error obtained without any mitigation technique,
   keeping the requirement of no calibration stage.},

Title = {A LARGE-BODIED ANOMALUROID RODENT FROM THE EARLIEST LATE EOCENE OF

Abstract = {A new genus and species of anomaluroid rodent, Kabirmys qarunensis, is
   described based on isolated teeth, partial mandibles, and an edentulous
   partial maxilla from the earliest late Eocene Birket Qarun Locality 2
   (BQ-2) in the Fayum Depression of northern Egypt. Kabirmys is the
   largest known Paleogene anomaluroid, with first lower molar area being
   about 2.5 times that of the roughly contemporaneous Nementchamys and
   Pondaungimys from Algeria and Myanmar, respectively. The genus exhibits
   distinctive features not seen in other Paleogene taxa, such as a
   complete mure, weak neo-endoloph, and open lingual sinus on the upper
   molars; Kabirmys lacks the complex enamel crenulations seen in
   Nementchamys and Pondaungimys. Phylogenetic analysis of dental features
   nests Kabirmys within crown Anomaluridae as a sister taxon of
   Nementchamys and Pondaungimys, but parsimony analysis following addition
   of a chronobiogeographic character places all of these taxa as basal
   stem members of Anomaluridae. This new evidence indicates that there was
   considerable diversity in body size and molar morphology among African
   anomaluroids near the middle-late Eocene boundary, and suggests that the
   group had an ancient origin on that landmass. Kabirmys shares some
   primitive features with the possible zegdoumyid `Glibia' namibiensis
   from the Paleogene of Namibia, and suggests that anomaluroids might be
   derived from a zegdoumyid-like ancestor. The disappearance of
   anomaluroids in the upper (latest Eocene to early Oligocene) levels of
   the Fayum succession might be related to global cooling through the
   later Paleogene, which might have removed suitable habitats from
   northern Africa.},

Abstract = {The received signal strength (RSS) of radiofrequency signals emitted
   from beacons placed at known locations in an environment, can be used by
   a local positioning system (LPS) to estimate the location of a person or
   a mobile object. In indoor environments, interference, multipath
   propagation of RF signals, and the presence of obstacles and people,
   lead to a complex spatial distribution of the RSS, which is inaccurately
   described by simple parametric models. In this work, we present a
   Bayesian method for an indoor RFID location system which uses an
   observation model based in Gaussian processes (GPs) nonparametric
   regression to represent the environment-specific RSS distributions for
   the individual RFID tags. The experimental results in an indoor
   environment demonstrate the effectiveness of GPs in order to increase
   positioning accuracy.},

Title = {Scaling of Chew Cycle Duration in Primates},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {138},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-44},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The biomechanical determinants of the scaling of chew cycle duration are
   important components of models of primate feeding systems at all levels,
   from the neuromechanical to the ecological. Chew cycle durations were
   estimated in 35 species of primates and analyzed in conjunction with
   data on morphological variables of the feeding system estimating moment
   of inertia of the mandible an force production capacity of the chewing
   muscles. Data on scaling of primate chew cycle duration were compared
   with the predictions of Simple pendulum and forced mass-spring system
   models of the feeding system. The gravity-driven pendulum model best
   predicts the observed cycle duration scaling but is rejected as
   biomechanically unrealistic. The forced mass-spring model predicts
   larger increases in chew cycle duration with size than observed, but
   provides reasonable predictions of cycle duration scaling. We
   hypothesize that intrinsic properties of the muscles predict spring-like
   behavior of the jaw elevator muscles during opening and fast close
   phases of the jaw cycle and that modulation of stiffness by the central
   nervous system leads to spring-like properties during the slow
   close/power stroke phase. Strepsirrhines show no predictable
   relationship between chew cycle duration and jaw length. Anthropoids
   have longer chew cycle durations than nonprimate mammals with similar
   mandible lengths, possibly due to their enlarged symphyses, which
   increase the moment of inertia of the mandible. Deviations from general
   scaling trends suggest that both scaling of the jaw muscles and the
   inertial properties of the mandible are important in determining the
   scaling of chew cycle duration in primates. Am J Phys Anthropol

Title = {Phylogenetic relationships between Hapalemur species and subspecies
   based on mitochondrial DNA sequences},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {2},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Background: Phylogenetic relationships of the genus Hapalemur remains
   controversial, particularly within the Hapalemur griseus species group.
   In order to obtain more information on the taxonomic status within this
   genus, and particularly in the cytogenetic distinct subspecies group of
   Hapalemur griseus, 357 bp sequence of cytochrome b and 438 bp of 12S
   mitochondrial DNAs were analyzed on a sample of animals captured in
   areas extending from the north to the south-east of Madagascar. This
   sample covers all cytogenetically defined types recognized of the genus
   Hapalemur.
   Results: Phylogenetic trees and distances analyses demonstrate a first
   emergence of Hapalemur simus followed by H. aureus which is the sister
   clade of the H. griseus subspecies. Hapalemur griseus is composed of 4
   subspecies separated into two clades. The first contains H. g. griseus,
   H. g. alaotrensis and H. g. occidentalis. The second consists of H. g.
   meridionalis. A new chromosomal polymorphic variant from the region of
   Ranomafana, H. griseus ssp, has been analysed and was found in both
   clades.
   Conclusions: Our results support the raising of H. g. meridionalis to
   the specific rank H. meridionalis, while neither cytogenetic nor
   molecular evidences support the raising of H. g. alaotrensis to a
   species rank despite its morphological characteristics. The new cytotype
   H. g. ssp which has been previously characterized by cytogenetic studies
   contains animals clustering either with the group of Hapalemur griseus
   griseus or with that of Hapalemur meridionalis. This suggests the
   existence of an ancestral polymorphism or an introgression of
   mitochondrial DNA between subspecies.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the concept of flexibility management as a critical
   and necessary tool for the acceleration of the electrification process
   that will bring significant benefits in terms of decarbonization of the
   energy system. In addition to identifying the value created by
   flexibility and how it can be harnessed as a system operation tool, it
   reviews the current regulatory and technical barriers to the
   implementation of efficient flexibility management, taking into account
   that flexibility is concentrated in the low voltage distribution network
   and can interact with each and every one of the system's agents. (C)

Title = {Bridging the Research Gap between Live Collections in Zoos and Preserved
   Collections in Natural History Museums},
Journal = {BIOSCIENCE},
Abstract = {Zoos and natural history museums are both collections-based institutions
   with important missions in biodiversity research and education. Animals
   in zoos are a repository and living record of the world's biodiversity,
   whereas natural history museums are a permanent historical record of
   snapshots of biodiversity in time. Surprisingly, despite significant
   overlap in institutional missions, formal partnerships between these
   institution types are infrequent. Life history information, pedigrees,
   and medical records maintained at zoos should be seen as complementary
   to historical records of morphology, genetics, and distribution kept at
   museums. Through examining both institution types, we synthesize the
   benefits and challenges of cross-institutional exchanges and propose
   actions to increase the dialog between zoos and museums. With a growing
   recognition of the importance of collections to the advancement of
   scientific research and discovery, a transformational impact could be
   made with long-term investments in connecting the institutions that are
   caretakers of living and preserved animals.},

Title = {A Literature Review of Unintentional Intoxications of Nonhuman Primates},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Simple Summary This report is an overview of the published veterinary
   literature on unintentional poisonings in wild and captive nonhuman
   primates (NHP). Selected intoxications will be described with emphasis
   on the clinical signs, laboratory, and main postmortem findings as well
   as the available treatment options. Mostly, NHP died suddenly and
   unexpectedly without showing any preceding clinical signs. The
   (presumptive) diagnosis of a poisoning was mostly made postmortem by
   laboratory testing of post-mortem fluid, tissue samples, and stomach
   contents. From these reports, we concluded that the toxic threats to
   wild NHP are different to those of captive NHP because of the
   environment in which they live. We also concluded that a poisoning or an
   intoxication should be part of a differential diagnosis when a NHP
   presents with clinical signs that cannot be linked to a known disorder
   or dies suddenly with no preceding clinical signs. Reports of
   unintentional intoxications in nonhuman primates (NHP) are few and an
   up-to-date review of such intoxications in NHP is lacking. We reviewed
   the published veterinary literature on unintentional intoxications in
   wild and captive NHP in order to provide a useful resource on known
   toxic agents of NHP for veterinarians, caregivers, and researchers who
   work with NHP. To these ends, we first conducted a literature search for
   books, book chapters, peer-reviewed publications, conference
   proceedings, and newsletters in academic literature databases such as
   Google Scholar, PubMed, BioOne Complete, and Web of Science using the
   words and word combinations such as heavy metals, pesticides,
   poisonings, and nonhuman primates. We then evaluated the search results
   for those reports that we considered as clinically relevant and then
   classified them according to the toxic agent. We identified lead, zinc,
   phytotoxins, pesticides, botulinum toxin, polychlorinated biphenyls, and
   snake and spider venoms as the main toxic agents in wild and captive
   NHP. We concluded that the toxic threats to wild NHP are different to
   those of captive NHP because of the environment in which they live. We
   recommend that an intoxication should be part of a differential
   diagnosis when a NHP presents with clinical signs that cannot be linked
   to a known disorder or dies suddenly with no preceding clinical signs.
   In cases of the former, laboratory testing for known toxins and
   pollutants should be conducted. In cases of the latter, a thorough
   postmortem examination, together with extensive laboratory testing, for
   known toxins and environmental pollutants in all tissues and organs
   should be performed.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a passive and an online estimator of the dc bus
   parameters (series resistance R-s, inductance L-s, and capacitance C)
   used in doubly fed induction machines for wind applications. This kind
   of machines is widely adopted as generators for wind applications, where
   predictive maintenance is an important cost-reduction driver. Two
   implementations are described, plug-in or parallel, depending on whether
   the algorithm runs in the application digital control platform or as a
   standalone diagnostic device. Neither requires maintenance shutdown or
   dc current measurements to estimate bus parameters. In the plug-in
   operation, the proposed method relies only on the electrical quantities
   required by the control system, i.e., stator-side and rotor-side
   voltages and currents. Conversely, in parallel mode, dedicated external
   voltage and current sensors are used. In both cases, the series RLC
   estimation is based on a recursive least squares algorithm that works
   for the full speed range of regular operation required in wind energy
   applications. In this way, the replacement of deteriorated capacitors
   can be performed by monitoring the estimated parameters. The validity of
   the proposal is discussed based on a theoretical analysis, simulation
   results, and experimental validations.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Abstract = {Objectives (1) To investigate sex differences in molar wear in known-age
   Cayo Santiago rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and, (2) To explore sex
   differences in body weight and molar eruption timing as factors
   influencing sex differences in molar wear. Materials and methods Data
   set I comprises wear scores, ages and body weights of 212 living monkeys
   included in the 1985 roundup. Data set II consists of molar wear
   measurements taken on 2D images of 103 of these monkeys' dental remains.
   Ordinal logistic regression was used to analyze the first data set.
   General linear models were used to analyze the second. Results Males
   generally exhibited more wear than females at equivalent chronological
   ages, though results varied by tooth type for the second data set. Male
   body weight in the full 1985 living sample was significantly related to
   dental wear, when age was taken into account; however, when males less
   than 8 years of age were eliminated from the sample, the association
   between dental wear and weight became statistically insignificant.
   Analysis of the second data set suggested no statistically significant
   sex difference in dental wear for third molars, despite the
   approximately 2 year sex difference in eruption age for this tooth type.
   Discussion This study suggests that body weight in males might be a
   predictor of dental wear and that if it is, body weight might also
   influence sex differences in dental wear. Sex differences in dental
   eruption timing do not appear to explain sex differences in dental wear
   in this sample.},

Title = {Abundance of introduced rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) in central
   Florida},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS},
Abstract = {Introduced non-human primates threaten native ecosystems and have the
   potential to transmit diseases to humans and native wildlife, but
   primate population management is challenging and often controversial.
   Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), native to much of Asia, were
   introduced to an island in the Silver River in central Florida (Marion
   County, U.S.A.) in the 1930s and 40s. An initial population of
   approximately twelve individuals has grown and spread throughout what is
   now Silver Springs State Park. In 2015, the park was home to at least
   176 rhesus macaques despite the removal of approximately 1000 animals
   over the preceding 30 years. The Silver River flows east into the
   Ocklawaha River, where rhesus macaques were reported as early as the
   1970s. Population management or further research on the effects of
   rhesus macaques in Florida requires estimates of abundance, home range,
   and distribution, yet prior to this study the abundance and spatial
   distribution of the Ocklawaha groups were unknown. In this study, we
   evaluated minimum population size, number of groups, and minimum winter
   home range size of Ocklawaha River groups, and compared these metrics
   with the previously-studied Silver River groups. We surveyed a 52 km
   section of the Ocklawaha River using baited camera traps and river
   surveys for ten weeks. We identified six Ocklawaha River macaque groups,
   each containing between fourteen and 39 individuals, for a minimum
   abundance of 134 individuals. Minimum winter home ranges were between
   3.63 and 11.89 km, measured as the linear distance between the furthest
   points at which a group was observed. Overall, Ocklawaha groups were
   smaller and had larger winter home ranges than Silver River groups, a
   difference likely driven by provisioning from tourists along the
   heavily-visited Silver River. This information is crucial for management
   of the central Florida rhesus macaque population and for future research
   regarding population growth and ecology of this invasive species.},

Title = {Expert range maps of global mammal distributions harmonised to three
   taxonomic authorities},

Abstract = {Aim: Comprehensive, global information on species' occurrences is an
   essential biodiversity variable and central to a range of applications
   in ecology, evolution, biogeography and conservation. Expert range maps
   often represent a species' only available distributional information and
   play an increasing role in conservation assessments and macroecology. We
   provide global range maps for the native ranges of all extant mammal
   species harmonised to the taxonomy of the Mammal Diversity Database
   (MDD) mobilised from two sources, the Handbook of the Mammals of the
   World (HMW) and the Illustrated Checklist of the Mammals of the World
   (CMW).
   Location: Global.
   Taxon: All extant mammal species.
   Methods: Range maps were digitally interpreted, georeferenced,
   error-checked and subsequently taxonomically aligned between the HMW
   (6253 species), the CMW (6431 species) and the MDD taxonomies (6362
   species).
   Results: Range maps can be evaluated and visualised in an online map
   browser at Map of Life (mol.org) and accessed for individual or batch
   download for non-commercial use.
   Main conclusion: Expert maps of species' global distributions are
   limited in their spatial detail and temporal specificity, but form a
   useful basis for broad-scale characterizations and model-based
   integration with other data. We provide georeferenced range maps for the
   native ranges of all extant mammal species as shapefiles, with
   species-level metadata and source information packaged together in
   geodatabase format. Across the three taxonomic sources our maps entail,
   there are 1784 taxonomic name differences compared to the maps currently
   available on the IUCN Red List website. The expert maps provided here
   are harmonised to the MDD taxonomic authority and linked to a community
   of online tools that will enable transparent future updates and version
   control.},

Title = {Wild skuas can use acoustic cues to locate hidden food},
Journal = {ANIMAL COGNITION},
Abstract = {Among animals, the visual acuity of several predatory bird species is
   probably the most outstanding. This, and the ease with which visually
   based tasks are administered, has led researchers to predominantly use
   the visual modality when studying avian cognition. Some wild skua
   populations routinely use acoustic cues emitted by their prey during
   foraging. In this study, we thus assessed whether this species was able
   to locate hidden food using acoustic cues alone (training phase). During
   the subsequent test phase, we investigated the capacity of successful
   individuals to choose the correct baited container in four conditions:
   (i) baited (shaking the baited container), (ii) full information
   (shaking both containers), (iii) exclusion (shaking the empty
   container), and (iv) control (shaking neither container). Four out of
   ten subjects succeeded in locating the baited container in the training
   phase. During the test phase, most subjects chose the baited container
   significantly more than the empty container in the baited and full
   information condition, while their performance was at chance level in
   the control condition. When no sound emanated from the empty container
   in the exclusion condition, one out of four skuas chose the baited
   container with more accuracy than predicted by chance. As this bird
   chose correctly on the first trial and during the first five trials, its
   performance is unlikely due to learning processes (learning to exclude
   the empty container). Although further tests are necessary to draw firm
   conclusions, our results open the way for assessing further this
   species' reasoning abilities in the wild.},

Title = {A morphometric analysis of early Eocene Euprimate tarsals from Gujarat,
   India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {164},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Early Eocene primate postcranial bones from the Vastan lignite mine of
   Gujarat, India, have proven useful for understanding the haplorhine and
   strepsirrhine divergence. Previous analyses of material assigned to
   Asiadapidae supported interpretations that these primates were
   generalized arboreal quadrupeds, while the omomyid Vastanomys was likely
   to have been more proficient leaper than asiadapids. More recent
   examinations of long bone cross-sectional properties and calcaneal
   elongation have complicated the behavioral interpretations of these
   fossils. This study examines whole talar and calcaneal morphology of the
   Vastan material to refine the locomotor reconstructions of these
   fossils. A comparative sample of extant primate species representing
   various locomotor behaviors was obtained by accessing surface models
   from MorphoSource.org. Surface models of fossil specimens attributed to
   Asiadapis cambayensis, Marcgodinotius indicus, and Vastanomys major were
   generated from micro-computed tomography scans. A morphological analysis
   was carried out using weighted spherical harmonics, a Fourier-based
   method that represents surfaces using coefficients associated with a
   common set of spherical harmonic functions. The coefficients describing
   each surface were then used as shape variables in a principal components
   analysis. Significant differences between locomotor groups were assessed
   using nonparametric tests. Results from extant comparative samples show
   that locomotor behavior can be predicted from both talar and calcaneal
   morphology when phylogenetic relationships are known. Consistent with
   previous analyses, our results indicate that Asiadapis cambayensis and
   Marcgodinotius indicus were likely arboreal quadrupeds with some leaping
   capabilities. Vastanomys major is reconstructed as an arboreal quadruped
   with greater leaping proficiency than its asiadapid counterparts based
   on its talar morphology. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {MicroRNA families are ubiquitous in the human transcriptome, yet
   targeting of individual members is challenging because of sequence
   homology. Many secondary structures of the precursors to these miRNAs
   (pri-and pre-miRNAs), however, are quite different. Here, we demonstrate
   both in vitro and in cellulis that design of structure-specific small
   molecules can inhibit a particular miRNA family member to modulate a
   disease pathway. The miR-200 family consists of five miRNAs,
   miR-200a,-200b,-200c,-141, and-429, and is associated with type 2
   diabetes (T2D). We designed a small molecule that potently and
   selectively targets pre-miR-200c's structure and reverses a
   pro-apoptotic effect in a pancreatic b cell model. In contrast, an
   oligonucleotide targeting the RNA's sequence inhibited all family
   members. Global proteomics and RNA sequencing analyses further
   demonstrate selectivity for miR-200c. Collectively, these studies
   establish that miR-200c plays an important role in T2D, and small
   molecules targeting RNA structure can be an important complement to
   oligonucleotides.},

Title = {Dental macrowear, diet, and anterior tooth use in Colobus polykomos and
   Piliocolobus badius},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {163},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Two similarly-sized colobine species living sympatrically in the Ivory
   Coast's Tai Forest that differ in both diet and oral processing behavior
   provide an opportunity to explore the strength of associations between
   feeding behavior and dental wear patterns. Here we test the hypothesis
   that vigorous processing of tough, hard Pentaclethra macrophylla pods by
   Colobus polykomos manifests in greater anterior tooth wear relative to
   that observed in Piliocolobus badius, which does not exploit this
   resource. We assessed levels of anterior tooth wear in a sample of 160
   upper incisors and 131 lower incisors from 18 adult Colobus polykomos
   and 62 adult Piliocolobus badius naturally deceased individuals from Tai
   National Park. We operationalized tooth wear by dividing the area of
   exposed dentin by total occlusal crown area. To assess relative degrees
   of incisor wear, we regressed incisor wear against molar wear (sample
   1/4 105 upper molars, 135 lower molars) for the pooled Colobus polykomos
   and Piliocolobus badius wear data and compared the number of individuals
   from each species that fell above and below the pooled regression curve
   for each model using Chi-square tests of independence and odds ratios.
   Under our hypothesis, we would expect more Colobus polykomos points
   above the pooled regression curve than Piliocolobus badius, indicating
   higher incisor wear relative to molar wear in Colobus polykomos. Nine of
   sixteen interspecific comparisons demonstrated this predicted pattern;
   however, none of the Chi-square tests or odds ratios were significant,
   indicating no difference between Colobus polykomos and Piliocolobus
   badius incisor wear relative to molar wear. The absence of significant
   differences in incisor wear relative to molar wear highlights the
   challenge of identifying idiosyncratic feeding behavior in fossil taxa
   and the necessity for continued exploration of the relationship between
   diet and macrowear.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Comparing transmission potential networks based on social network

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE},

Abstract = {Social and spatial network analysis is an important approach for
   investigating infectious disease transmission, especially for pathogens
   transmitted directly between individuals or via environmental
   reservoirs. Given the diversity of ways to construct networks, however,
   it remains unclear how well networks constructed from different data
   types effectively capture transmission potential. We used empirical
   networks from a population in rural Madagascar to compare social network
   survey and spatial data-based networks of the same individuals. Close
   contact and environmental pathogen transmission pathways were modelled
   with the spatial data. We found that naming social partners during the
   surveys predicted higher close-contact rates and the proportion of
   environmental overlap on the spatial data-based networks. The spatial
   networks captured many strong and weak connections that were missed
   using social network surveys alone. Across networks, we found weak
   correlations among centrality measures (a proxy for superspreading
   potential). We conclude that social network surveys provide important
   scaffolding for understanding disease transmission pathways but miss
   contact-specific heterogeneities revealed by spatial data. Our analyses
   also highlight that the superspreading potential of individuals may vary
   across transmission modes. We provide detailed methods to construct
   networks for close-contact transmission pathogens when not all
   individuals simultaneously wear GPS trackers.},

Title = {An intergenerational androgenic mechanism of female intrasexual
   competition in the cooperatively breeding meerkat},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 17},
Abstract = {Female intrasexual competition can be intense in cooperatively breeding
   species, with some dominant breeders (matriarchs) limiting reproduction
   in subordinates via aggression, eviction or infanticide. In males, such
   tendencies bidirectionally link to testosterone, but in females, there
   has been little systematic investigation of androgen-mediated behaviour
   within and across generations. In 22 clans of wild meerkats (Suricata
   suricatta), we show that matriarchs 1) express peak androgen
   concentrations during late gestation, 2) when displaying peak feeding
   competition, dominance behaviour, and evictions, and 3) relative to
   subordinates, produce offspring that are more aggressive in early
   development. Late-gestation antiandrogen treatment of matriarchs 4)
   specifically reduces dominance behaviour, is associated with infrequent
   evictions, decreases social centrality within the clan, 5) increases
   aggression in cohabiting subordinate dams, and 6) reduces offspring
   aggression. These effects implicate androgen-mediated aggression in the
   operation of female sexual selection, and intergenerational transmission
   of masculinised phenotypes in the evolution of meerkat cooperative
   breeding.
   `In some mammals, matriarchal status can be conferred with androgens.
   Here, the authors identify effects of androgens that implicate
   androgen-mediated aggression in female sexual selection in meerkats and
   intergenerational transmission of masculinised phenotypes in the
   evolution of meerkat cooperative breeding.'},

Abstract = {Future biodiversity loss threatens the integrity of complex ecological
   associations, including among hosts and parasites. Almost half of
   primate species are threatened with extinction, and the loss of
   threatened hosts could negatively impact parasite associations and
   ecosystem functions. If endangered hosts are highly connected in
   host-parasite networks, then future host extinctions will also drive
   parasite extinctions, destabilizing ecological networks. If threatened
   hosts are not highly connected, however, then network structure should
   not be greatly affected by the loss of threatened hosts. Networks with
   high connectance, modularity, nestedness and robustness are more
   resilient to perturbations such as the loss of interactions than sparse,
   nonmodular and non-nested networks. We analysed the interaction network
   involving 213 primates and 763 parasites and removed threatened primates
   (114 species) to simulate the effects of extinction. Our analyses
   revealed that connections to 23\% of primate parasites (176 species) may
   be lost if threatened primates go extinct. In addition, measures of
   network structure were affected, but in varying ways because threatened
   hosts have fewer parasite interactions than non-threatened hosts. These
   results reveal that host extinctions will perturb the host-parasite
   network and potentially lead to secondary extinctions of parasites. The
   ecological consequences of these extinctions remain unclear. This
   article is part of the theme issue `Infectious disease macroecology:
   parasite diversity and dynamics across the globe'.},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {This article proposes a method to estimate the impedance of lithium-ion
   cells by using an excitation signal. The injection signal is intended to
   be delivered to the battery module by the power converter used for the
   interface of the energy storage and using the current and voltage
   measurements provided by the module battery management system (BMS). The
   estimation method is conducted in two steps. During the system
   commissioning, the impedance is estimated by using a frequency-domain
   method known as vector fitting. Despite its high accuracy, it has an
   important computational burden that makes it difficult to use in
   real-time applications running on the embedded systems often used for
   battery and converter control. For that reason, during the regular
   operation, a recursive least squares algorithm is proposed, being the
   initial estimation given by the frequency-domain method employed during
   the commissioning process. The discussion includes not only the
   description and testing of the method but also the effects due to the
   reduced digital-domain resolution of the acquired data used for the
   estimation (terminal current and cell voltage), as well as the
   discretization method used for the digital implementation. The proposal
   is validated by simulation and by experimental results using the cell
   measurements provided by a BMS of a commercial module.},

Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},

Month = {OCT 25},
Abstract = {Taste perception plays an essential role in food selection. Umami
   (savory) tastes are sensed by a taste receptor complex, T1R1/T1R3, that
   detects proteinogenic amino acids.' High sensitivity to L-glutamate
   (L-Glu) is a characteristic of human T1R1/T1R3, but the T1R1/T1R3 of
   other vertebrates does not consistently show this L-Glu response. 1 ` 2
   Here, we demonstrate that the L-Glu sensitivity of T1R1/T1R3 is a
   derived state that has evolved repeatedly in large primates that rely on
   leaves as protein sources, after their divergence from insectivorous
   ancestors. Receptor expression experiments show that common amino acid
   substitutions at ligand binding sites that render T1R1/T1R3 sensitive to
   L-Glu occur independently at least three times in primate evolution.
   Meanwhile T1R1/T1R3 senses 5'-ribonucleotides as opposed to L-Glu in
   several mammalian species, including insectivorous primates. Our
   chemical analysis reveal that L-Glu is one of the major free amino acids
   in primate diets and that insects, but not leaves, contain large amounts
   of free 5'-ribonucleotides. Altering the ligand-binding preference of
   T1R1/T1R3 from 5'-ribonucleotides to L-Glu might promote leaf
   consumption, overcoming bitter and aversive tastes. Altogether, our
   results provide insight into the foraging ecology of a diverse mammalian
   radiation and help reveal how evolution of sensory genes facilitates
   invasion of new ecological niches.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY},

Abstract = {Objective:\& nbsp;The curative effect of high-efficiency progesterone
   and other therapeutic drugs for endometrioid adenocarcinoma patients
   with preservation of reproductive capacity has not been satisfactory so
   far. Novel therapeutic drugs need to be explored.</p>
   <br></p>
   Methods:\& nbsp;We investigated the cytoplastic and nuclear expression
   levels of LMTK3 between endometrioid adenocarcinoma tissues and adjacent
   endometrial tissues by immunohistochemistry. We detected the effects of
   LMTK3 on cell viability of Ishikawa cells by CCK-8. We detected the
   effects of LMTK3 on cell cycle and apoptosis of Ishikawa cells by flow
   cytometry. We also detected the effects of LMTK3 knockdown on mRNA and
   protein levels of ERa by qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. We
   also used the cBioPortal online database to analyze the coexpression of
   LMTK3 and ESR1 in 1647 UCEC samples.</p>
   <br></p>
   Results:\& nbsp;We used TMAs to identify that LMTK3 was mainly detected
   in the cytoplasm of endometrioid tissues, and cytoplasmic LMTK3
   expression in endometrioid tissues was higher than that in adjacent
   endometrial tissues (P < 0.05). LMTK3 knockdown decreased the
   proliferation of Ishikawa cells through decreasing cell viability (P <
   0.01), increasing G1 (P < 0.001) arrest, and promoting apoptosis (P <
   0.01). There was a positive correlation between the mRNA expression
   levels of LMTK3 and ESR1 (Spearman: P=2.011e-5, R=0.13; Pearson:
   P=7.18e-8, R=0.17). Knockdown of LMTK3 also reduced the mRNA (P < 0.001)
   and protein (P < 0.001) levels of ERa.</p>
   <br></p>
   Conclusions:\& nbsp;Inhibitors of LMTK3 may be a possible future
   treatment for ERa and LMTK3 highly expressed endometrioid adenocarcinoma
   following appropriate studies.</p>},

Title = {The Infertility Trap: The Fertility Costs of Group-Living in Mammalian
   Social Evolution},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Mammal social groups vary considerably in size from single individuals
   to very large herds. In some taxa, these groups are extremely stable,
   with at least some individuals being members of the same group
   throughout their lives; in other taxa, groups are unstable, with
   membership changing by the day. We argue that this variability in
   grouping patterns reflects a tradeoff between group size as a solution
   to environmental demands and the costs created by stress-induced
   infertility (creating an infertility trap). These costs are so steep
   that, all else equal, they will limit group size in mammals to similar
   to 15 individuals. A species will only be able to live in larger groups
   if it evolves strategies that mitigate these costs. We suggest that
   mammals have opted for one of two solutions. One option (fission-fusion
   herding) is low cost but high risk; the other (bonded social groups) is
   risk-averse, but costly in terms of cognitive requirements.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Design science as a research paradigm is gaining popularity in the
   information systems (IS) discipline. E-government research explores IS
   artifacts designed to improve the quality and efficiency of public
   administration and service. This paper utilizes the E-government Design
   Research Model (EgovDR Model) to review e-government designs. Through a
   comprehensive literature review, this paper identifies prototypical
   e-government tasks for design science implementation and the
   corresponding solutions. We demonstrate whether and how the development
   and evolution of e-government designs continue to gain relevance in
   design science research. Additionally, this paper identifies and
   analyzes the theories employed in the literature to illustrate how the
   EgovDR Model has facilitated e-government designs in increasing rigor
   over time. Our findings indicate the majority of the workpractice tasks
   in existing e-government designs are decision-support tasks.},

Abstract = {Both biotic and abiotic factors are important for maintaining the
   activity cycles of animals and may determine the most advantageous
   periods for eating, moving, and sleeping. Although the solar day-night
   cycle is among the most central of abiotic variables, a number of
   species are active both day and night. Three-toed sloth (genus Bradypus
   Linnaeus, 1758) populations across the Neotropics show this pattern,
   with activity occurring at various times within the 24 h cycle. In the
   current study, we used radio-tracking techniques to investigate the
   daily temporal patterning of brown-throated three-toed sloth (Bradypus
   variegatus Schinz, 1825) displacement in Amazonian flooded igapo forest
   and compared the results with populations studied in other habitats. We
   concluded that igapo sloths are cathemeral, and discussed that
   environmental temperature, nutritional needs and the presence of
   predators may be the main factors influencing their activity pattern.},

Abstract = {The Oligocene Malembo locality, Cabinda exclave, Angola, has yielded a
   rich vertebrate fauna represented by fragmentary remains. This
   fossiliferous locality is the only definite occurrence of Oligocene
   terrestrial mammals in sub-Saharan West Africa. The hyracoids from
   Malembo have only been very succinctly described and compared thus far,
   so that their systematic attribution is not consensual among
   specialists. A revision now allows the identification of three (or four)
   medium to large-sized species represented by Geniohyus dartevellei,
   Pachyhyrax cf. crassidentatus, and two undetermined taxa. The species G.
   dartevellei is revived for the holotype of Palaeochoerus dartevellei
   Hooijer, 1963; this species is unique to Malembo but appears close to
   Geniohyus mirus, a species only known from the early Oligocene of the
   Fayum, Egypt. Other species of Geniohyus and Pachyhyrax crassidentatus
   are also only known from the early Oligocene of the Fayum. The presence
   of Geniohyus and Pachyhyrax cf. crassidentatus at Malembo thus supports
   an early Oligocene age for the fauna. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Title = {An Evolutionary Explanation for the Female Leadership Paradox},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {Social influence is distributed unequally between males and females in
   many mammalian societies. In human societies, gender inequality is
   particularly evident in access to leadership positions. Understanding
   why women historically and cross-culturally have tended to be
   under-represented as leaders within human groups and organizations
   represents a paradox because we lack evidence that women leaders
   consistently perform worse than men. We also know that women exercise
   overt influence in collective group-decisions within small-scale human
   societies, and that female leadership is pervasive in particular
   contexts across non-human mammalian societies. Here, we offer a
   transdisciplinary perspective on this female leadership paradox.
   Synthesis of social science and biological literatures suggests that
   females and males, on average, differ in why and how they compete for
   access to political leadership in mixed-gender groups. These differences
   are influenced by sexual selection and are moderated by socioecological
   variation across development and, particularly in human societies, by
   culturally transmitted norms and institutions. The interplay of these
   forces contributes to the emergence of female leaders within and across
   species. Furthermore, females may regularly exercise influence on group
   decisions in less conspicuous ways and different domains than males, and
   these underappreciated forms of leadership require more study. We offer
   a comprehensive framework for studying inequality between females and
   males in access to leadership positions, and we discuss the implications
   of this approach for understanding the female leadership paradox and for

Title = {The key role of aggregators in the energy transition under the latest
   European regulatory framework},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {134},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Future energy systems are reliant on the expansion and management of
   low-carbon technologies in order to reach climate goals. Impact studies
   of high-penetration intermittent renewable energy sources and electric
   vehicle (EV) integration in the distribution networks have demonstrated
   voltage violation and congestion issues. The role of a clustered
   coordination of distributed energy resources (DER) with a focus on
   aggregators is presented in terms of legal and techno-economic aspects.
   The latest European framework assigns aggregators a fundamental role in
   energy market liberalisation and DER integration towards carbon-neutral
   energy systems. Aggregator energy management strategies are examined for
   different DER scenarios, and analysed in the context of the actual
   situation of aggregators in Europe. The investigation aims to clearly
   depict how the new European policies of 2019 envision the future
   electricity network, in order to reevaluate the role of aggregators
   taking into account implemented concepts in the current market
   situation, and the status of aggregator research since 2015 up to date.},

Title = {Intraspecific variation in molar topography of the early Eocene stem

Abstract = {Variation in postcanine teeth is relevant to answering questions about
   both taxonomy and diet. In such contexts, understanding the patterns and
   the amounts of variation present in a single species is fundamentally
   important. Here we use dental topographic analysis (DTA) to study
   variation in functional aspects of the lower second molar (n = 51) and
   lower fourth premolar (n = 41) in a large, stratigraphically controlled
   sample of the early Eocene stem primate Microsyops latidens, which
   permits study of fine scale variation through time in a single species,
   during a period of notable climatic change. To contextualize variation
   in M. latidens, we used DTA to study extant euarchontan taxa,
   representing three orders and seven families (n = 96). Previous study of
   M. latidens suggested that it was highly variable in size and lower
   molar morphology, potentially giving rise to later species of
   microsyopids. However, comparison with extant taxa suggests that the
   dental form of M. latidens shows low levels of intraspecific variation.
   The dental topography of M. latidens also does not reflect the
   previously postulated taxonomic split. Our results suggest instead that
   M. latidens likely did not undergo change in dental topography
   consistent with a shift in either dietary adaptive niche or ecospace.
   Taken together, our results suggest low levels of variation in dental
   form and potentially diet of M. latidens, indicating that this taxon
   likely remained within a single adaptive zone.},

Abstract = {This article explores the use of a variable inductor as a reactive
   element for energy transfer in a dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter. By
   using a controlled variable inductor, the optimal switching region in
   the operation of the phase-shift DAB can be extended, and thus, high
   efficiencies can be achieved over wider load ranges compared to the
   traditional solution. Moreover, the combined use of the variable
   inductance together with the phase shift, as two control parameters,
   allows for the linearization of the DAB converter transfer function,
   which improves the stability and the performance of the controller. And
   finally, due to the controlled saturation of the device, it is feasible
   to reduce the magnetic core size, yielding a size optimization of the
   full converter. This article develops a circuit-based model to simulate
   the converter system, aiming to study the proposed improvements.
   Furthermore, a 2-kW SiC-based DAB converter prototype is constructed,
   including a controlled variable inductor. The experimental results
   presented in this article validate the studies carried out for the
   different operation conditions.},

Abstract = {Ending hunger and alleviating poverty are key goals for a sustainable
   future. Food security is a constant challenge for agrarian communities
   in low-income countries, especially in Madagascar. We investigated
   agricultural practices, household characteristics, and food security in
   northeast Madagascar. We tested whether agricultural practices,
   demographics, and socioeconomics in rural populations were related to
   food security. Over 70\% of respondents reported times during the last
   three years during which food for the household was insufficient, and
   the most frequently reported cause was small land size (57\%). The
   probability of food insecurity decreased with increasing vanilla yield,
   rice yield, and land size. There was an interaction effect between land
   size and household size; larger families with smaller land holdings had
   higher food insecurity, while larger families with larger land had lower
   food insecurity. Other socioeconomic and agricultural variables were not
   significantly related to food insecurity, including material wealth,
   education, crop diversity, and livestock ownership. Our results
   highlight the high levels of food insecurity in these communities and
   point to interventions that would alleviate food stress. In particular,
   because current crop and livestock diversity were low, agricultural
   diversification could improve outputs and mitigate food insecurity.
   Development of sustainable agricultural intensification, including
   improving rice and vanilla cultivation to raise yields on small land
   areas, would likely have positive impacts on food security and
   alleviating poverty. Increasing market access and off-farm income, as
   well as improving policies related to land tenure could also play
   valuable roles in mitigating challenges in food security.},

Title = {Habitat use of constant frequency echolocating bats in north-west
   Madagascar with acoustic evidence for a possible new species},
Journal = {ACTA CHIROPTEROLOGICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {153-164},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Bioacoustics can be a non-invasive, cost-effective way of studying
   echolocating bats, and is especially useful for detecting and
   identifying rare or cryptic species. The insectivorous bats of
   Madagascar are understudied in comparison to the rest of the island's
   fauna, and very little is known about their habitat use. Here, we used a
   remote bioacoustic surveying technique in a bat survey of the
   Sahamalaza-Iles Radama National Park, northwest Madagascar, to study
   constant frequency echolocating bats (Hipposideridae and
   Rhinonycteridae). We used two passive acoustic monitoring units to
   automatically record bat activity from dusk until dawn in a range of
   habitat types that are characteristic of the region. Analysis of call
   acoustic parameters revealed three distinct constant-frequency phonic
   types within the national park, which we identified as Commerson's
   leaf-nosed bat (Macronycteris commersoni), the red trident bat
   (Triaenops menamena) and an unknown phonic type of ca. 78 kHz. We found
   significant differences in the habitat usage of these three species,
   suggesting species-specific habitat preferences among Madagascar's bats.
   Our statistical analyses revealed significant differences between the
   acoustic echolocation calls of these three phonic types. The 78 kHz
   calls do not match any of the other constant frequency-calling bat
   species currently described for Madagascar, indicating either acoustic
   divergence among bat sub-populations or the possible existence of a new
   undescribed species. These results highlight the need for increased
   survey efforts to gain an understanding of species-specific geographic
   distributions and habitat usage among Malagasy bats and to disentangle
   their cryptic species complexes.},

   photophysical characterization, we assess the label-induced effects on
   the gapmers' RNA affinities, RNA-hybridized secondary structures, and
   knockdown efficiencies. Importantly, we find practically no perturbing
   effects for gapmers with single FBA incorporations in the biologically
   critical gap region and, except for pA, the FBAs do not affect the
   knockdown efficiencies. Incorporating two cytosine FBAs in the gap is
   equally well tolerated, while two adenine analogues give rise to
   slightly reduced knockdown efficiencies and what could be perturbed
   secondary structures. We furthermore show that the FBAs can be used to
   visualize gapmers inside live cells using fluorescence microscopy and
   flow cytometry, enabling comparative assessment of their uptake. This
   altogether shows that FBAs are functional ASO probes that provide a
   minimally perturbing in-sequence labeling option for this highly
   relevant drug modality.},

Abstract = {Contact tracing is a key public health intervention during the
   coronavirus pandemic. While government contact tracing apps (e.g.,
   COVIDSafe) may enforce personal information protection, privacy concerns
   remain among citizens. To date, few studies have investigated the
   adoption of contact tracing technology and corresponding citizen
   information privacy concerns. To address this gap, we propose a research
   model to explore the impact of individual privacy concerns, trust, and
   risk perceptions on citizen's willingness to download a federal contact
   tracing app. To test the model, we administer a survey to Australian
   citizens to assess their perceptions of the government's ``COVIDSafe{''}
   app. The results of this study indicate that relative advantage,
   compatibility and trusting beliefs increase adoption intentions. The
   study provides recommendations for governments tackling COVID-19 and
   guidance for contact tracing strategies in preparation for future
   pandemics.},

Title = {Socioecological conditions predict degu social instability and provide
   limited cues to forecast subsequent breeding conditions},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {75},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Permanent changes in group membership may result in detrimental fitness
   effects on both group residents and immigrants. Factors associated with
   this form of social instability are rarely documented. We used a 15-year
   dataset on degus, a social and short-lived species, to test the
   hypothesis that physical condition and socioecological factors
   experienced during breeding are associated with social instability in
   terms of group individual membership (hypothesis 1). We also tested the
   hypothesis that these factors represent potential cues for individuals
   to predict social instability conditions during subsequent breeding
   (i.e., exhibiting autocorrelation) (hypothesis 2). Social instability in
   degu group membership was ubiquitous. Social instability increased with
   increasing ectoparasite load but decreased with increasing food
   abundance, increasing degu density, increasing mean minimum temperature,
   and increasing number of female group members. Of these conditions, degu
   density during winter exhibited autocorrelation. Finally, overall
   predictability of ecological conditions varied from low to high within a
   5-6-year period. These findings indicate that socioecological conditions
   experienced by the breeding adults and their developing offspring
   predict within-year social instability (hypothesis 1) and provide some
   limited cues to individuals to predict similar conditions during the
   subsequent breeding event (hypothesis 2).
   Significance statement
   Permanent changes in the adult composition of social groups (social
   instability) can have significant impacts on the fitness of group
   members. Determining the ecological and social conditions associated
   with social instability and whether individuals can anticipate social
   instability in adulthood can inform socioecological theory. In the
   communally rearing rodent, Octodon degus, social instability during
   breeding is ubiquitous and impacts the fitness of adult males and
   females differently. We determined that social instability in degu
   groups during breeding is associated with local ecological conditions
   (ambient temperature, ectoparasite loads, abundance of food, population
   density) and the social environment (number of adult females). Of the
   ecological variables, only population density exhibited autocorrelation.
   These results are important because they imply limited ecological cues
   available for the offspring to anticipate social instability conditions
   as adults.},

Journal = {BIOMOLECULES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central regulator of
   cellular homeostasis that integrates environmental and nutrient signals
   to control cell growth and survival. Over the past two decades,
   extensive studies of mTOR have implicated the importance of this protein
   complex in regulating a broad range of metabolic functions, as well as
   its role in the progression of various human diseases. Recently, mTOR
   has emerged as a key signaling molecule in regulating animal entry into
   a hypometabolic state as a survival strategy in response to
   environmental stress. Here, we review current knowledge of the role that
   mTOR plays in contributing to natural hypometabolic states such as
   hibernation, estivation, hypoxia/anoxia tolerance, and dauer diapause.
   Studies across a diverse range of animal species reveal that mTOR
   exhibits unique regulatory patterns in an environmental
   stressor-dependent manner. We discuss how key signaling proteins within
   the mTOR signaling pathways are regulated in different animal models of
   stress, and describe how each of these regulations uniquely contribute
   to promoting animal survival in a hypometabolic state.},

Title = {Interbase-FRET binding assay for pre-microRNAs},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {The aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRs) has been linked to several
   human diseases. A promising approach for targeting these anomalies is
   the use of small-molecule inhibitors of miR biogenesis. These inhibitors
   have the potential to (i) dissect miR mechanisms of action, (ii)
   discover new drug targets, and (iii) function as new therapeutic agents.
   Here, we designed Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-labeled
   oligoribonucleotides of the precursor of the oncogenic miR-21
   (pre-miR-21) and used them together with a set of aminoglycosides to
   develop an interbase-FRET assay to detect ligand binding to pre-miRs.
   Our interbase-FRET assay accurately reports structural changes of the
   RNA oligonucleotide induced by ligand binding. We demonstrate its
   application in a rapid, qualitative drug candidate screen by assessing
   the relative binding affinity between 12 aminoglycoside antibiotics and
   pre-miR-21. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration
   calorimetry (ITC) were used to validate our new FRET method, and the
   accuracy of our FRET assay was shown to be similar to the established
   techniques. With its advantages over SPR and ITC owing to its high
   sensitivity, small sample size, straightforward technique and the
   possibility for high-throughput expansion, we envision that our
   solution-based method can be applied in pre-miRNA-target binding
   studies.},

Abstract = {The Internet of things (IoT) paradigm is paving the way to ensure
   connectivity and monitoring within different market fields. Thus, it is
   critical to understand the packet transmission performance in Low Power
   Wide Area Network (LPWAN), especially LoRaWAN. Packet delivery rate
   (PDR) is considered as a dominant factor of the network performance and
   its dependency on the signal power. However, previous works do not model
   the PDR as a function of the received signal power. An in-depth
   investigation of the PDR is done by performing an outdoor measurement
   campaign in the area of the Campus Beaulieu in Rennes. For each received
   LoRa packet, the effective signal power (ESP) values are obtained as
   well as their high influence on PDR is proven. With the given results,
   modelling the PDR using an ESP-parameterized beta distribution function
   is proposed. Feasibility of the proposed model is assured by simulating
   PDR against ESP, hence, the simulated PDR values follow the distribution
   of the measured ones well. This PDR model gives important guidelines for
   future LoRaWAN network regulation and optimization.},

Title = {An Evaluation of Spire Radio Occultation Data in Assimilative
   Ionospheric Model GPSII and Validation by Ionosonde Measurements},
Journal = {RADIO SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of results obtained using
   NWRA's assimilative ionospheric model GPSII when it is driven by Spire
   Global, Inc.'s global navigation satellite system - radio occultation
   (GNSS-RO) measurements. Results of the assimilative model are validated
   using the database of Digisonde and Dynasonde ionograms. A week's worth
   of dual-frequency phase data was collected from Spire's constellation of
   low-Earth orbiting micro-satellites carrying GNSS receivers and
   assimilated into GPSII. A validation study of GNSS-RO measurements was
   performed in four geographical regions. GPSII operation with the data
   was evaluated and the results were validated against independent
   ionospheric measurements. Ground-based ionosondes were employed in
   diagnosing the accuracy of the derived models; we studied the
   differences between the F2 peak parameters (the F2 layer critical
   frequency, f0F2, and the peak height of the F2 layer, HmF2) derived from
   ionograms and those computed with GPSII. For the 1,491 validation events
   used in this study, the magnitude of the deviation of the
   GPSII-predicted f0F2 at an ionosonde location from the corresponding
   ionosonde-observed value was found on average to be 0.608 MHz (with a
   median of 0.461 MHz) and the magnitude of the deviation of the
   GPSII-predicted HmF2at an ionosonde location from the corresponding
   ionosonde-observed value was found to be on average 22.9 km (with a
   median value of 18.0 km). Median GPSII validation errors for f0F2 are a
   factor of four smaller than corresponding errors for IRI, while GPSII
   HmF2 errors are a factors of two smaller than those for IRI. The
   analysis showed that Spire's TEC data was both compatible for ingestion
   into GPSII and that the assimilation of the data improved the comparison
   to ground-based ionosondes.},

Abstract = {Mutations play a key role in the development of disease in an individual
   and the evolution of traits within species. Recent work in humans and
   other primates has clarified the origins and patterns of
   single-nucleotide variants, showing that most arise in the father's
   germline during spermatogenesis. It remains unknown whether larger
   mutations, such as deletions and duplications of hundreds or thousands
   of nucleotides, follow similar patterns. Such mutations lead to
   copynumber variation (CNV) within and between species, and can have
   profound effects by deleting or duplicating genes. Here, we analyze
   patterns of CNV mutations in 32 rhesus macaque individuals from 14
   parent-offspring trios. We find the rate of CNV mutations per generation
   is low (less than one per genome) and we observe no correlation between
   parental age and the number of CNVs that are passed on to offspring. We
   also examine segregating CNVs within the rhesus macaque sample and
   compare them to a similar data set from humans, finding that both
   species have far more segregating deletions than duplications. We
   contrast this with long-term patterns of gene copy-number evolution
   between 17 mammals, where the proportion of deletions that become fixed
   along the macaque lineage is much smaller than the proportion of
   segregating deletions. These results suggest purifying selection acting
   on deletions, such that the majority of them are removed from the
   population over time. Rhesus macaques are an important biomedical model
   organism, so these results will aid in our understanding of this species
   and the disease models it supports.},

Title = {No Planet for Apes? Assessing Global Priority Areas and Species Affected
   by Linear Infrastructures},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {57-73},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Approximately 65\% of primate species are facing extinction, with
   threats including the impacts of linear infrastructures such as roads,
   railways, and power lines, associated with habitat loss and
   fragmentation, direct and indirect mortality, and changes in animal
   behavioral patterns. Nevertheless, this is an often-overlooked topic in
   primatology, and there is limited information on which regions and
   species are most affected by linear infrastructures. Here, we provide a
   global assessment of priority areas and primate species for conservation
   by integrating information from global-scale open-access data sets on
   the distributional ranges, traits, and threats to primate species and
   linear infrastructures, together with a systematic literature review and
   a questionnaire sent to primatological societies. We produced a
   bivariate map that reflects the patterns of co-occurrence of the
   Conservation Value and Infrastructure Density. From this map we
   highlight Primate Mitigation Areas (regions with high Primate
   Conservation Value and Infrastructure Density), which are areas where
   infrastructure mitigation should be prioritized; and the Primate
   Preservation Areas (regions with high Primate Conservation Value and low
   Infrastructure Density), which represent areas that should be preserved
   from further infrastructure development. Primate Mitigation Areas
   primarily include the Atlantic forest of Brazil, the Guinean forests of
   West Africa, and most of Southeastern Asia, whereas Primate Preservation
   Areas are found principally in the Amazon and Congo River basins. Our
   assessment also produced a list of priority species affected by
   infrastructures, with the great apes and gibbons ranking highest. Global
   infrastructure projects, especially the Belt and Road Initiative, can
   seriously affect both priority areas (particularly preservation areas)
   and the most vulnerable species, due to the massive sprawl of linear
   infrastructures and associated human activity. Thus, we call for
   dedicated strategic environmental and social assessments throughout
   these different economic corridors within the Belt and Road Initiative
   planning process, prior to developing the different projects. Our
   assessment can serve as a tool to coordinate management actions and
   legislation around the world.},

Title = {A new parapithecine (Primates: Anthropoidea) from the early Oligocene of
   Libya supports parallel evolution of large body size among parapithecids},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {153},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Parapithecines are an extinct subfamily of stem anthropoid primates
   previously known only from the Jebel Qatrani Formation in Egypt. Here,
   we describe isolated teeth pertaining to Simonsius harujensis sp. nov.,
   a relatively small-bodied parapithecine from strata near Zallah Oasis in
   the Sirt Basin of central Libya that is estimated to date to similar to
   31 Ma on the basis of mammalian biostratigraphy. The dental morphology
   of S. harujensis sp. nov. is generally intermediate between that of the
   closely related parapithecines Parapithecus fraasi and Simonsius
   grangeri, highlighting some of the anatomical features distinguishing
   the latter taxa and providing further support for their generic
   separation. A phylogenetic analysis using parsimony methods was
   performed on a character-taxon matrix incorporating data from the new
   Libyan parapithecine, virtually all other parapithecids and the
   proteopithecid Proteopithecus sylviae. Results of this analysis suggest
   that parapithecids comprise a basal clade consisting of three species of
   Biretia and a more derived clade including Parapithecinae (Parapithecus
   and Simonsius) and Qatraniinae (Qatrania, Ucayalipithecus, and Apidium).
   Body mass estimates for parapithecids were calculated on the basis of
   regression equations generated to predict body mass from the occlusal
   area of upper and lower cheek teeth in extant anthropoids. The
   relatively small body mass of S. harujensis sp. nov. and its
   reconstructed phylogenetic position as the sister group of S. grangeri,
   which is the largest known parapithecid, support the convergent
   acquisition of body mass larger than 500 g among multiple clades of
   early Oligocene African anthropoids. The new Libyan parapithecine
   augments previously reported evidence supporting a substantial degree of
   faunal provincialism across northern Africa/Arabia during the early
   Oligocene. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Electrical Railway Dynamical Versus Static Models for Infrastructure
   Planning and Operation},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS},
Abstract = {Simulation tools are essential to design the infrastructure and plan the
   trains operations of electrical railway systems. Traditionally, the
   train model (that estimates the electrical, mechanical and kinematical
   behaviors of the vehicles) and electrical network model (that estimates
   the electrical behavior of the energy supply network) are developed
   separately. Then, they are simulated together to estimate the
   interactions between both subsystems. The paper objective is to compare
   different models to highlight the impacts on the interactions between
   the vehicles and the railway electrical network, which are crucial to
   have accurate estimations of the system behavior. For this purpose, a
   new dynamical model, which is based on a systemic approach and a
   causality analysis, is compared to a conventional static model, which is
   based on a cartesian approach and a power flow analysis. The dynamical
   model is accurate and has been experimentally validated but requires a
   long computational time. The static model is fast to compute and give a
   good estimation of the energy consumption for conventional railway
   systems. However, it is not always able to estimate the power flows
   within the DC network, and especially when all traction power
   substations are blocked.},

Title = {On the trail of primate scent signals: A field analysis of callitrichid
   scent-gland secretions by portable gas chromatography-mass spectrometry},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},

Abstract = {Chemosignals are mediators of social interactions in mammals, providing
   con- and hetero-specifics with information on fixed (e.g., species, sex,
   group, and individual identity) and variable (e.g., social,
   reproductive, and health status) features of the signaler. Yet,
   methodological difficulties of recording and quantifying odor signals,
   especially in field conditions, have hampered studies of natural
   systems. We present the first use of the Torion (R) portable gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) instrument for in situ chemical
   analysis of primate scents. We collected and analyzed swab samples from
   the scent glands and skin from 13 groups (57 individuals) of two
   sympatric species of wild emperor tamarins, Saguinus imperator, and
   Weddell's saddleback tamarins, Leontocebus weddelli (Callitrichidae). In
   total, 11 compounds of interest (i.e., probably derived from the
   animals) could be detected in the samples, with 31 of 215 samples
   containing at least one compound of interest. The composition of these
   31 samples varied systematically with species, group, sex, and breeding
   status. Moreover, we tentatively identified seven of the compounds of
   interest as methyl hexanoate, benzaldehyde, ethyl hexanoate,
   acetophenone, a branched C15 alkane, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde, and
   hexadecan-1-ol. As the field of primate semiochemistry continues to
   grow, we believe that portable GC-MS instruments have the potential to
   help make progress in the study of primate chemosignaling in field
   conditions, despite limitations that we encountered. We further provide
   recommendations for future use of the Torion (R) portable GC-MS for in
   situ analyses.},

Title = {User values and the development of a cybersecurity public policy for the
   IoT},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {56},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Public administrators, entrusted to develop public policy to manage the
   growing complexities of the IoT, face significant challenges. The
   challenges exist because of three reasons; First, there is a lack of
   policy direction. Second, user values related to cybersecurity are not
   well understood. Third, there is a lack of clarity as to how IoT public
   policy should be developed. In this paper we argue that new IoT policy
   should be guided by key stakeholder values (i.e. what users think to be
   important). We utilize the Public Value Forum to elicit public values to
   inform decision-making surrounding IoT policy by public administrators,
   conceptually informed by Rational choice theory. We use a five-phase
   process to introduce the decision context (i.e. the policy problem),
   define fundamental objectives, rank these objectives, identify
   value-based trade-offs between them and construct a multi-attribute
   utility model. The findings indicate several key themes for IoT security
   from the citizens themselves and decision-making administrators in
   diverse public agencies developing IoT cybersecurity public policy.},

Title = {Yawn contagion in domestic pigs (Sus scrofa)},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Contrary to spontaneous yawning-an ancient phenomenon common to
   vertebrates-contagious yawning (elicited by others' yawns) has been
   found only in highly social species and may reflect an emotional
   inter-individual connection. We investigated yawn contagion in the
   domestic pig, Sus scrofa. Owing to the complex socio-emotional and
   cognitive abilities of Sus scrofa, we posited that yawn contagion could
   be present in this species (Prediction 1) and influenced by
   individual/social factors (Prediction 2). In June-November 2018, on 104
   semi-free ranging adolescent/adult pigs, 224 videos were recorded for
   video analysis on yawning. Kinship information was refined via genetic
   analyses. Statistical elaboration was conducted via GLMMs and
   non-parametric/randomization/cross-tabulation tests. We found yawn
   contagion in Sus scrofa, as it was more likely that pigs yawned when
   perceiving rather than not perceiving (yawning/control condition)
   others' yawns (response peak in the first out of three minutes). Yawn
   contagion was more likely: (1) in response to males' yawns; (2) as the
   age increased; (3) within short distance (1 m); (4) between full
   siblings, with no significant association between kinship and distance.
   The influence of kinship suggests that-as also hypothesized for Homo
   sapiens-yawn contagion might be linked with emotional communication and
   possibly contagion.},

Abstract = {With the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is critical to
   understand the packet transmission performance in Low Power Wide Area
   Network (LPWAN), especially LoRaWAN. Previous works on LoRaWAN network
   performance analysis, either simulation-based or field measurement, are
   considering the Packet Delivery Rate (PDR) as a major measure of the
   network performance and its dependency on the signal impairments.
   However, the Effective Signal Power (ESP) and its huge variability along
   with the different frequency bands, for each location, are not generally
   considered. In this paper, an in-depth investigation of the frequency
   dependency of the PDR is done by performing an outdoor measurement
   campaign in the area of the Campus Beaulieu in Rennes. From each
   different location, the ESP and SINR (Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise
   Ratio) values are obtained as well as the influence of these parameters
   on the PDR is evaluated at each frequency band independently. In the
   given results, the feasibility of using the ESP is proven by its
   enlarged range when the SINR is very low, unlike the RSSI which has a
   limitation. This investigation manifests and gives important guidelines
   for using ESP in the future IoT applications.},

Abstract = {This work discusses a novel set of alternate implementations of isolated
   gate driver circuits for power electronic transistors. The proposed
   topologies for the driver have been designed specifically for SiC power
   MOSFET. Three different solutions are discussed, all of them providing
   the required gate turn-on and turn-off command signal with galvanic
   isolation, but also supplying power to the secondary side of the driver
   by means of magnetic transformers. The resulting solutions, all of them
   implemented with simple circuitry, enable the integration of the driver
   into the power cell, allowing for theoretical higher power density
   values in the final system. The principle of operation of the different
   solutions is discussed, and then the main relevant implementation
   details are presented. After that, the operation of the circuits is
   demonstrated experimentally, by testing a set of prototypes of these
   drivers. This provides a comprehensive design example that assesses the
   feasibility of the proposed solutions. Finally, the main results of the
   performance of the three gate drivers, on an SiC MOSFET-based prototype
   are presented and compared.},

Abstract = {Ongoing fast paced research work on electric vehicles (EVs) demands
   efficient software tools to emulate different aspects of the EVs for
   more advancement and development of EV charging infrastructure in the
   power systems to assist massive adoption in coming years. In this regard
   an efficient EV load simulation model has been developed acquiring
   probabilistic method for characterizing the stochastic nature of EVs
   which generates the schedule of EVs charging to ultimately achieve the
   EV load profile for impact study of EVs on distribution network. Model
   has been tested under different settings and by generating different
   scenarios to make it viable, realistic and adaptable to any defined
   characteristics. Moreover, all the source codes have been socialised and
   uploaded to the IEEEDataPort repository.},

Abstract = {An analytical switching losses model of the power semiconductor devices
   is a precise and simple way to evaluate and optimise the efficiency of
   power electronic converters; which are one of the most important parts
   of electrical vehicles (EVs) because they work as the interface between
   the elements in the electric power train and the energy storage systems.
   These models allow to predict and enhance the performance of the
   converter, by giving the ability to optimise the losses, thus increase
   the efficiency and the reliability of the converters and the EV system.
   Given their suitability for high-frequency power applications, Gallium
   Nitride (GaN) High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) are a widely
   used solution, yielding high power density levels at the full system.
   However, this also increases the impact of the effect of parasitic
   elements in the device on the turn-on and off transitions at the
   switching operation. In this paper, a simple analytical model for GaN
   transistors is provided. The switching waveforms are divided into
   multiple stages to simplify the analysis and to help in getting a more
   accurate model. Using the proposed model the switching losses can be
   calculated, and the switching transitions can be predicted precisely.
   The novelty of this work is the ability to calculate the current
   overshoot which makes it possible for a better switching losses
   estimation. The results will be compared with simulation results, which
   were done using LTspice software.},

Title = {Land-use history determines stand structure and tree diversity in
   vanilla agroforests of northeastern Madagascar},
Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Question In human-modified tropical landscapes, agroforestry is
   considered a promising land use to reconcile biodiversity conservation
   with production goals. The role of agroforests regarding conservation
   may be strongly influenced by land-use history; however, few studies
   have explicitly investigated this. We therefore tested the importance of
   land-use history for habitat structure and tree diversity in vanilla
   agroforests situated in a human-modified tropical landscape.
   Location Smallholder mosaic landscape of northeastern Madagascar.
   Methods We studied tree stand structure, diversity and composition in
   vanilla agroforests of contrasting land-use history, old-growth forests,
   forest fragments and woody fallows after slash-and-burn agriculture,
   which all contribute to the smallholder mosaic landscape of northeastern
   Madagascar. The vanilla agroforests were either derived directly from
   forest or otherwise from woody fallows after slash-and-burn agriculture.
   Results Land-use history strongly influenced tree species diversity and
   composition in vanilla agroforests and also affected stand structure.
   Forest-derived agroforests maintained high levels of tree species
   diversity and differed in community composition from fallow-derived
   agroforests, which had relatively low levels of tree diversity.
   Additionally, forest-derived vanilla agroforests harboured a
   significantly higher percentage of endemic species than fallow-derived
   agroforests, and forest-derived agroforests also shared many species
   with old-growth forests and forest fragments. Fallow-derived vanilla
   agroforests harboured a lower percentage of endemic species than woody
   fallows.
   Conclusion Considering the land-use history of agroforests is important
   to unfold their full potential as elements in a multifunctional
   human-modified landscape. Forest-derived agroforests are an alternative
   to forest conversion through slash-and-burn agriculture and have the
   potential to sustain high levels of species diversity and important
   habitat structures. In contrast, fallow-derived agroforests regain stand
   structure on degraded historically forested land and thereby have the
   potential to increase canopy cover and connectivity at the landscape
   scale.},

Abstract = {In order for markerless augmented reality (AR) to reach its full
   potential in educational settings it must be able to adapt to the wide
   range of possible environments, devices and user cognitive states that
   affect learning outcomes. Shared educational spaces, such as classrooms,
   art galleries, museums, teaching hospitals and wildlife centers present
   enticing opportunities in terms of specialized AR applications, existing
   infrastructure to leverage, and large numbers of AR sessions to gather
   data on. In this work we make feasible the challenging concept of
   context-aware AR through the use of a `local expert', which learns the
   optimal configuration of AR algorithms and virtual content for the
   specific educational space and use case for which it is implemented. To
   compute insights from multiple AR devices, enable timely responses to
   fast-changing user cognitive states, and ensure the security of
   sensitive user data, we propose an edge-computing architecture, in which
   storage and computation related to our local expert is performed on a
   server on the same local area network as the mobile AR devices.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an innovative approach to observe the slant total
   electron content (TEC) structures from coherently reflected Global
   Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals collected by Spire Global
   CubeSats over the Arctic region. The high latitudes offer the pathway
   for solar and geomagnetic disturbances to impact the ionosphere. The
   magnitude of the GNSS-reflectometly (GNSS-R) derived TEC disturbance is
   quantified by the rate of TEC index (ROTI). A case study for a severe
   geomagnetic storm that occurred on May 12, 2021, is presented in this
   paper. The objective of the study is to demonstrate that GNSS-R
   measurement has the potential to offer a new ionosphere data source at
   high latitudes to fill the void of observations due to sparsity of GNSS
   receivers over oceans, inaccessible terrains, and GNSS satellite orbit
   inclination constraint.},

Abstract = {Contrary to other in-car engineering systems where the use of simulation
   tools is highly extended prior to a prototyping stage, the simulation of
   vehicular electrical distribution systems (EDSs) is not still a common
   practice as manufacturers so far have mainly relied on laborious
   empirical procedures for technical validation. However, to provide
   flexibility in EDS design and procure even faster endorsement, the
   development of computation tools on this subject is compelling
   considering the intricacy of these networks. To face this challenge,
   this work provides guidelines and experiences to develop a customised
   platform for EDS visualisation and simulation within the automotive
   industry context. The use of agile techniques for software development,
   visual analytics, and tailored power flow methods is highlighted among
   other aspects. Realistic case studies are presented to discuss the
   attributes of the implemented computational tool. To also provide
   relevant perspectives on how future EDS visualisation and simulation
   platforms will be developed, the latest research is discussed in topics
   such as new electric/electronic architectures, electro-thermal analysis,
   electronic fuses, mild hybrid power trains, hardware in the loop, and
   high-voltage networks.},

Title = {Non-linear switched model for accurate voltage estimation and power flow

Abstract = {Simulation tools are crucial to efficiently design the infrastructures
   and operations of DC electrical railway systems, including potential
   innovative technologies such as reversible traction power substations
   and energy storage systems. For this purpose, it is essential to
   accurately estimate the evolution of the voltage and power flows within
   the DC traction network, with fast computation time. This study,
   therefore, proposes a new simulation approach for fast and accurate
   voltage estimation and power flow analysis of DC railway systems. It is
   based on the use of non-linear switched models for traction power
   substations and trains. The modified nodal analysis is extended to
   consider such models, including the voltage drop control of the
   different subsystems, avoiding the necessity to use complex numerical
   iterative solvers. This new approach is validated and compared to an
   existing dynamical model and a conventional static model. The
   comparisons prove the relevance of the new approach, which provides
   validated and accurate results (<2\% error compared to the validated
   dynamical model) with fast computation time (speed up of 500 compared to
   the dynamical model). It can, therefore, be used to study, design, size,
   and optimise DC traction systems with new technologies aimed at saving
   braking energy.},

Title = {Primate phylogenomics uncovers multiple rapid radiations and ancient

Abstract = {Our understanding of the evolutionary history of primates is undergoing
   continual revision due to ongoing genome sequencing efforts. Bolstered
   by growing fossil evidence, these data have led to increased acceptance
   of once controversial hypotheses regarding phylogenetic relationships,
   hybridization and introgression, and the biogeographical history of
   primate groups. Among these findings is a pattern of recent
   introgression between species within all major primate groups examined
   to date, though little is known about introgression deeper in time. To
   address this and other phylogenetic questions, here, we present new
   reference genome assemblies for 3 Old World monkey (OWM) species:
   Colobus angolensis ssp. palliatus (the black and white colobus), Macaca
   nemestrina (southern pig-tailed macaque), and Mandrillus leucophaeus
   (the drill). We combine these data with 23 additional primate genomes to
   estimate both the species tree and individual gene trees using thousands
   of loci. While our species tree is largely consistent with previous
   phylogenetic hypotheses, the gene trees reveal high levels of
   genealogical discordance associated with multiple primate radiations. We
   use strongly asymmetric patterns of gene tree discordance around
   specific branches to identify multiple instances of introgression
   between ancestral primate lineages. In addition, we exploit recent
   fossil evidence to perform fossil-calibrated molecular dating analyses
   across the tree. Taken together, our genome-wide data help to resolve
   multiple contentious sets of relationships among primates, while also
   providing insight into the biological processes and technical artifacts
   that led to the disagreements in the first place.},

Abstract = {As the world confronts the health challenges of an ageing population,
   there has been dramatically increased interest in the science of ageing.
   This research has overwhelmingly focused on age-related disease,
   particularly in industrialized human populations and short-lived
   laboratory animal models. However, it has become clear that humans and
   long-lived primates age differently than many typical model organisms,
   and that many of the diseases causing death and disability in the
   developed world are greatly exacerbated by modern lifestyles. As such,
   research on how the human ageing process evolved is vital to
   understanding the origins of prolonged human lifespan and factors
   increasing vulnerability to degenerative disease. In this issue, we
   highlight emerging comparative research on primates, highlighting the
   physical, physiological, behavioural and cognitive processes of ageing.
   This work comprises data and theory on non-human primates, as well as
   under-represented data on humans living in small-scale societies, which
   help elucidate how environment shapes senescence. Component papers
   address (i) the critical processes that comprise senescence in
   long-lived primates; (ii) the social, ecological or individual
   characteristics that predict variation in the pace of ageing; and (iii)
   the complicated relationship between ageing trajectories and disease
   outcomes. Collectively, this work provides essential comparative,
   evolutionary data on ageing and demonstrates its unique potential to
   inform our understanding of the human ageing process.
   This article is part of the theme issue `Evolution of the primate ageing
   process'.},

Title = {New dentognathic fossils of Noropithecus bulukensis (Primates,
   Victoriapithecidae) from the late Early Miocene of Buluk, Kenya},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {148},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The late Early Miocene site of Buluk, Kenya, has yielded fossil remains
   of several catarrhine primates, including 16 dentognathic specimens of
   the stem cercopithecoid Noropithecus bulukensis. With the exception of
   the large sample of Victoriapithecus macinnesi from the middle Miocene
   of Maboko Island, Kenya, the majority of stem cercopithecoid taxa are
   represented by small sample sizes. We describe and analyze 91 new
   cercopithecoid fossils collected from Buluk between 2004 and 2018,
   including several previously undescribed tooth positions for N.
   bulukensis, and provide the first evaluation of dental metric and
   morphological variation in this sample. The results show that the
   expanded Buluk sample exhibits high levels of dental variation in the
   postcanine tooth row, similar to V. macinnesi at Maboko, but this
   variation is consistent with a single-species hypothesis. Subtle
   differences in the shape of the I-1, breadth of the C-1 and P-3,
   relative breadth of M-1, upper and lower molar distal shelf lengths, the
   degree of M-2 basal flare, and a less-developed lower molar distal
   lophid differentiate the dentition of N. bulukensis from V. macinnesi.
   Although differences exist between the N. bulukensis and V. macinnesi
   dental samples, the high degree of variation within each sample
   complicates the identification of many individual specimens. New partial
   maxillae and mandibles allow reassessment of previously described
   diagnostic differences between N. bulukensis and V. macinnesi, negating
   upper molar arcade shape as a diagnostic feature and confirming the
   existence of differences in mandibular symphyseal morphology. Overall,
   new fossils from Buluk provide new evidence of the dentognathic anatomy
   of a medium-sized cercopithecoid that coexisted with a diverse group of
   noncercopithecoid catarrhines at the end of the early Miocene. (C) 2020

Abstract = {Anthropogenic habitat alteration and invasive species are threatening
   carnivores globally. Understanding the impact of these factors is
   critical for creating localized, effective conservation programmes.
   Madagascar's Eupleridae have been described as the least studied and
   most threatened group of carnivores. We investigated the effects of
   habitat degradation and the presence of people and exotic species on the
   modelled occupancy of the endemic fosa Cryptoprocta ferox, conducting
   camera-trap surveys in two western deciduous forests, Ankarafantsika
   National Park and Andranomena Special Reserve. Our results indicated no
   clear patterns between habitat degradation and fosa occupancy but a
   strong negative association between cats Felis sp. and fosas. Cat
   occupancy was negatively associated with birds and positively associated
   with contiguous forest and narrow trails. In contrast, dog Canis lupus
   familiaris occupancy was best predicted by wide trails, degraded forest
   and exotic civets. Our results suggest fosas are capable of traversing
   degraded landscapes and, in the short term, are resilient to contiguous
   forest disturbance. However, high occupancy of cats and dogs in the
   landscape leads to resource competition through prey exploitation and
   interference, increasing the risk of transmission of potentially fatal
   diseases. Management strategies for exotic carnivores should be
   considered, to reduce the widespread predation of endemic species and
   the transmission of disease.},

Title = {A protein tertiary structure mimetic modulator of the Hippo signalling
   pathway},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {Transcription factors are key protein effectors in the regulation of
   gene transcription, and in many cases their activity is regulated via a
   complex network of protein-protein interactions (PPI). The chemical
   modulation of transcription factor activity is a long-standing goal in
   drug discovery but hampered by the difficulties associated with the
   targeting of PPIs, in particular when extended and flat protein
   interfaces are involved. Peptidomimetics have been applied to inhibit
   PPIs, however with variable success, as for certain interfaces the
   mimicry of a single secondary structure element is insufficient to
   obtain high binding affinities. Here, we describe the design and
   characterization of a stabilized protein tertiary structure that acts as
   an inhibitor of the interaction between the transcription factor TEAD
   and its co-repressor VGL4, both playing a central role in the Hippo
   signalling pathway. Modification of the inhibitor with a
   cell-penetrating entity yielded a cell-permeable proteomimetic that
   activates cell proliferation via regulation of the Hippo pathway,
   highlighting the potential of protein tertiary structure mimetics as an
   emerging class of PPI modulators. Targeting the interaction between
   transcription factor TEAD and its co-repressor VGL4 is an attractive
   strategy to chemically modulate Hippo signaling. Here, the authors
   develop a proteomimetic with stabilized tertiary structure that inhibits
   the TEAD:VGL4 interaction in vitro and in cells.},

Abstract = {Data on the gut microbiota of animals can provide new insights into
   dietary ecology of hosts, consequently assisting in understanding their
   adaptation strategy and evolutionary potential. We studied the gut
   microbiota composition and function of the wild rhesus macaques (Macaca
   mulatta) using 16S rRNA sequencing method. Our results revealed that the
   gut microbiota of the wild rhesus macaques was dominated by Firmicutes,
   Bacteroidetes, and Spirochaetes. Diversity and richness of gut
   microbiota were higher during the dry season than the rainy season.
   Specifically, higher proportions of Firmicutes, Tenericutes,
   Cyanobacteria, and unclassified bacteria at the phylum level and
   moreCoprococcusat the genus level were detected in the dry season.
   Predictive functional analysis showed that pathways associated with
   carbohydrate metabolism and drug resistance (antimicrobial and
   antineoplastic) were richer in the dry season. These seasonal
   differences in microbiota could be due to their heavier dependence on
   leaf-based diet in the dry season. Additionally, macaques in limestone
   forests had a higher percentage of Spirochaetes, probably suggesting
   that the proportion of fruits in dietary composition also play an
   important role in the gut microbiota. We concluded that diet was
   strongly linked to the diversity, composition, and function of the gut
   microbiota in the wild groups of rhesus macaques living in the limestone
   forest, highlighting the importance of diet in the gut microbiota of
   macaques and the need to conduct further study on the adaptation
   strategy in response of environmental changes in the ground of gut
   microbiota.},

Title = {Infrared thermography cannot be used to approximate core body
   temperature in wild primates},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Understanding the physiological processes that underpin primate
   performance is key if we are to assess how a primate might respond when
   navigating new and changing environments. Given the connection between a
   mammal's ability to thermoregulate and the changing demands of its
   thermal environment, increasing attention is being devoted to the study
   of thermoregulatory processes as a means to assess primate performance.
   Infrared thermography can be used to record the body surface
   temperatures of free-ranging animals. However, some uncertainty remains
   as to how these measurements can be used to approximate core body
   temperature. Here, we use data collected from wild vervet monkeys
   (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) to examine the relationship between infrared
   body surface temperature, core body (intra-abdominal) temperature, and
   local climate, to determine to what extent surface temperatures reflect
   core body temperature. While we report a positive association between
   surface and core body temperature-a finding that has previously been
   used to justify the use of surface temperature measurements as a proxy
   for core temperature regulation-when we controlled for the effect of the
   local climate in our analyses, this relationship was no longer observed.
   That is, body surface temperatures were solely predicted by local
   climate, and not core body temperatures, suggesting that surface
   temperatures tell us more about the environment a primate is in, and
   less about the thermal status of its body core in that environment.
   Despite the advantages of a noninvasive means to detect and record
   animal temperatures, infrared thermography alone cannot be used to
   approximate core body temperature in wild primates.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {10},

Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an attractive one-carbon (C1) building block in
   terms of sustainability and abundance. However, its low reactivity
   limits applications in organic synthesis as typically high-energy
   reagents are required to drive transformations. Here, we present a
   redox-neutral C-H carboxylation of arenes and styrenes using a
   photocatalytic approach. Upon blue-light excitation, the anthrolate
   anion photocatalyst is able to reduce many aromatic compounds to their
   corresponding radical anions, which react with CO2 to afford carboxylic
   acids. High-throughput screening and computational analysis suggest that
   a correct balance between electron affinity and nucleophilicity of
   substrates is essential. This novel methodology enables the
   carboxylation of numerous aromatic compounds, including many that are
   not tolerated in classical carboxylation chemistry. Over 50 examples of
   C-H functionalizations using CO2 or ketones illustrate a broad
   applicability. The method opens new opportunities for the valorization
   of common arenes and may find application in late-stage C-H
   carboxylation.},

Title = {Factors influencing taxonomic unevenness in scientific research: a
   mixed-methods case study of non-human primate genomic sequence data
   generation},
Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Scholars have noted major disparities in the extent of scientific
   research conducted among taxonomic groups. Such trends may cascade if
   future scientists gravitate towards study species with more data and
   resources already available. As new technologies emerge, do research
   studies employing these technologies continue these disparities? Here,
   using non-human primates as a case study, we identified disparities in
   massively parallel genomic sequencing data and conducted interviews with
   scientists who produced these data to learn their motivations when
   selecting study species. We tested whether variables including
   publication history and conservation status were significantly
   correlated with publicly available sequence data in the NCBI Sequence
   Read Archive (SRA). Of the 179.6 terabases (Tb) of sequence data in SRA
   for 519 non-human primate species, 135 Tb (approx. 75\%) were from only
   five species: rhesus macaques, olive baboons, green monkeys, chimpanzees
   and crab-eating macaques. The strongest predictors of the amount of
   genomic data were the total number of non-medical publications (linear
   regression; r(2) = 0.37; p = 6.15 x 10(-12)) and number of medical
   publications (r(2) = 0.27; p = 9.27 x 10(-9)). In a generalized linear
   model, the number of non-medical publications (p = 0.00064) and closer
   phylogenetic distance to humans (p = 0.024) were the most predictive of
   the amount of genomic sequence data. We interviewed 33 authors of
   genomic data-producing publications and analysed their responses using
   grounded theory. Consistent with our quantitative results, authors
   mentioned their choice of species was motivated by sample accessibility,
   prior published work and relevance to human medicine. Our mixed-methods
   approach helped identify and contextualize some of the driving factors
   behind species-uneven patterns of scientific research, which can now be
   considered by funding agencies, scientific societies and research teams
   aiming to align their broader goals with future data generation efforts.},

Title = {Oldest Record of African Bagridae and Evidence from Catfishes for a

Abstract = {The Birket Qarun Formation, sampling upper Eocene deposits of the Fayum
   Depression, has been the subject of disagreement in terms of the
   environmental deposition. The formation has traditionally been
   considered to be a marine deposit but, more recently, one particular
   site, Birket Qarun Locality 2 (BQ-2), has been reported to have
   freshwater vertebrates, indicating that at least this locality in the
   formation contains terrestrial deposits. We here report a new varied
   assemblage of fossil catfishes from BQ-2, which adds new information
   with which to interpret the paleoenvironment of the locality. The new
   BQ-2 catfish assemblage includes the earliest record of the freshwater
   family Bagridae in Africa, as well as the oldest records
   ofFajumiaandSocnopaea, otherwise known only from the overlying marine
   deposits of the Qasr el-Sagha Formation. Notable among the finds are
   remains ofArius fraasiand two additional species of marine ariid
   catfishes, representing the first such occurrences from the Fayum
   deposits. These occurrences indicate that BQ-2 likely had marine
   influences, or perhaps thatFajumia,Socnopaea, andAriuswere euryhaline.
   In addition, the freshwater families Claroteidae and Mochokidae are
   represented among our collection. The new material documents the
   presence of a variety of taxa, and in addition it documents the
   variation in body size of members of the same family. Most evidence from
   other vertebrate fossils indicates that BQ-2 is a freshwater deposit,
   but some elements of the new catfish collection suggest the presence of
   nearshore marine influences, indicating that a much more complex
   environment was present.},

Title = {Reproductive seasonality in primates: patterns, concepts and unsolved
   questions},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {96},
Number = {1},
Pages = {66-88},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Primates, like other mammals, exhibit an annual reproductive pattern
   that ranges from strictly seasonal breeding to giving birth in all
   months of the year, but factors mediating this variation are not fully
   understood. We applied both a categorical description and quantitative
   measures of the birth peak breadth based on daily observations in zoos
   to characterise reproductive seasonality in 141 primate species with an
   average of 941 birth events per species. Absolute day length at the
   beginning of the mating season in seasonally reproducing species was not
   correlated between populations from natural habitats and zoos. The
   mid-point of latitudinal range was a major factor associated with
   reproductive seasonality, indicating a correlation with photoperiod.
   Gestation length, annual mean temperature, natural diet and Malagasy
   origin were other important factors associated with reproductive
   seasonality. Birth seasons were shorter with increasing latitude of
   geographical origin, corresponding to the decreasing length of the
   favourable season. Species with longer gestation periods were less
   seasonal than species with shorter ones, possibly because shorter
   gestation periods more easily facilitate the synchronisation of
   reproductive activity with annual cycles. Habitat conditions with higher
   mean annual temperature were also linked to less-seasonal reproduction,
   independently of the latitude effect. Species with a high percentage of
   leaves in their natural diet were generally non-seasonal, potentially
   because the availability of mature leaves is comparatively independent
   of seasons. Malagasy primates were more seasonal in their births than
   species from other regions. This might be due to the low resting
   metabolism of Malagasy primates, the comparatively high degree of
   temporal predictability of Malagasy ecosystems, or historical
   constraints peculiar to Malagasy primates. Latitudinal range showed a
   weaker but also significant association with reproductive seasonality.
   Amongst species with seasonal reproduction in their natural habitats,
   smaller primate species were more likely than larger species to shift to
   non-seasonal breeding in captivity. The percentage of species that
   changed their breeding pattern in zoos was higher in primates (30\%)
   than in previous studies on Carnivora and Ruminantia (13 and 10\%,
   respectively), reflecting a higher concentration of primate species in
   the tropics. When comparing only species that showed seasonal
   reproduction in natural habitats at absolute latitudes <= 11.75 degrees,
   primates did not differ significantly from these two other taxa in the
   proportion of species that changed to a less-seasonal pattern in zoos.
   However, in this latitude range, natural populations of primates and
   Carnivora had a significantly higher proportion of seasonally
   reproducing species than Ruminantia, suggesting that in spite of their
   generally more flexible diets, both primates and Carnivora are more
   exposed to resource fluctuation than ruminants.},

Title = {Montane regions shape patterns of diversification in small mammals and

Abstract = {Aim Madagascar is renowned for its exceptional species diversity and
   endemism. The island's mountainous regions are thought to have played a
   role in lineage and species diversification, but this has yet to be
   explored across taxonomic groups and a temporal context has not yet been
   identified. We tested whether montane regions have promoted population
   divergence in Madagascar's vertebrate fauna and, if so, whether these
   divergence events were contemporaneous. Location Moist evergreen forests
   of Madagascar. Taxa Small mammals and reptiles. Methods We analysed
   mitochondrial DNA data from 20 small-mammal and five reptile species
   widely distributed across Madagascar's moist evergreen forests. We used
   phylogenetic and population genetic analyses to identify major
   phylogeographic patterns, then used linear regression to determine if
   the strength of phylogeographic structure is related to taxon, body size
   or elevation. Finally, we tested whether or not divergence across
   highlands occurred synchronously in multiple species, and used
   simulations to assess the power of these analyses to accurately estimate
   divergence times. Results We observed a shared phylogeographic pattern
   across multiple species that suggests Madagascar's northern, central and
   southern highlands have served as important regions of diversification
   on Madagascar. This pattern was recovered across taxa with varying body
   sizes and elevational distributions. We also identified four pulses of
   divergence between the northern and central highlands since the late
   Miocene, although simulations suggest that our empirical data cannot
   recover the number or timing of divergence events with high certainty.
   Finally, we observed several instances of deep intraspecific genetic
   splits, suggesting that several of the species we evaluated may
   represent cryptic species complexes. Main Conclusions We identified a
   highland-driven phylogeographic pattern plus several cases of cryptic
   endemism and recent speciation, which have important evolutionary and
   conservation implications. This work presents a new phylogeographic
   hypothesis for recent diversification on Madagascar, reaffirms the
   urgent need for continued collection of voucher specimens and
   illuminates areas of particular importance for safeguarding genetic
   diversity in one of the world's foremost and threatened biodiversity
   hotspots.},

Title = {Revision of Oligocene `Paraphiomys' and an origin for crown

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {`Paraphiomys' simonsi is a phiomorph rodent from the early Oligocene of
   Egypt (similar to 29-30 Mya) that has historically been aligned with
   much younger (<similar to 20 Mya) Miocene species of the genera
   Paraphiomys and Neosciuromys. Here, we use Bayesian tip-dating analysis
   of a 109-character morphological matrix containing 57 living and extinct
   ctenohystricans to test these proposed placements for Paraphiomys'
   simonsi. Our analyses provide support for the exclusion of `Paraphiomys'
   simonsi from both Paraphiomys and Neosciuromys and justify the
   establishment of a new genus (Monamys gen. nov.) for this stem
   thryonomyoid. These analyses also indicate that the divergence of the
   extant dassie rat Petromus from the extant cane rat Thryonomys (i.e.
   origin of crown Thryonomyoidea) occurred similar to 23.7 Mya, close to
   the Oligocene-Miocene boundary and in close agreement with recent
   molecular estimates for this split. Miocene Neosciuromys, Paraulacodus,
   Protohummus and the type species of Paraphiomys are identified as stem
   thryonomyids, whereas the Namibian species Apodecter strorneri, Tufamys
   woodi,Paraphiomys' australis and Paraphionzys' roessneri are identified
   for the first time as stem petromurids, raising the possibility of a
   long period of endemic petromurid evolution in south-west Africa.
   Comparison of molecular divergence estimates with our optimal tip-dated
   topology suggests that stem bathyergoids are most likely to have arisen
   from late Eocene and early Oligocene `phiomyids'.},

Abstract = {The Microsyopidae are extinct mammals from the late Paleocene-late
   Eocene of North America and the late Paleocene of Europe. While results
   from phylogenetic analyses support euarchontan affinities, specific
   relationships of microsyopids to other plesiadapiforms (plausible stem
   primates), Euprimates (crown primates), Scandentia (treeshrews), and
   Dermoptera (colugos) are unresolved. An exceptionally well-preserved
   cranium ofMicrosyops annectensincludes a basicranium that is generally
   primitive relative to that of other extinct and extant euarchontans in
   having: (1) a transpromontorial groove for an unreduced internal carotid
   artery (ICA) entering the middle ear posteromedially; (2) grooves (not
   tubes) on the promontorium, marking the course for both stapedial and
   promontorial branches of the ICA; (3) a foramen faciale that opens into
   the middle ear cavity, with the facial nerve exiting through a
   stylomastoid foramen primitivum; and (4) unexpanded caudal and rostral
   tympanic processes of the petrosal. The absence of any preserved bullar
   elements in the middle ear contrasts with that of other plesiadapiforms
   for which the region has been recovered, all of which have evidence of
   an ossified bulla.Microsyopslacks many of the specialized cranial
   characteristics of crown scandentians and dermopterans. The basicranial
   anatomy of microsyopids does not provide evidence in support of a clear
   link to any of the extant euarchontans, and suggests that the primitive
   morphology of this region in Euarchonta was little differentiated from
   that observed in the primitive placental mammals.},

Title = {Design of a small molecule that stimulates vascular endothelial growth

Abstract = {A selection-based screen has now revealed preferences in small-molecule
   chemotypes that bind RNA as well as preferences in the RNA motifs that
   bind small molecules. Analysis of these data enabled the design of a
   small molecule that selectively binds a non-coding microRNA and
   upregulates expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A.
   Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) stimulates angiogenesis in
   human endothelial cells, and increasing its expression is a potential
   treatment for heart failure. Here, we report the design of a small
   molecule (TGP-377) that specifically and potently enhances VEGFA
   expression by the targeting of a non-coding microRNA that regulates its
   expression. A selection-based screen, named two-dimensional
   combinatorial screening, revealed preferences in small-molecule
   chemotypes that bind RNA and preferences in the RNA motifs that bind
   small molecules. The screening program increased the dataset of known
   RNA motif-small molecule binding partners by 20-fold. Analysis of this
   dataset against the RNA-mediated pathways that regulate VEGFA defined
   that the microRNA-377 precursor, which repressesVegfamessenger RNA
   translation, is druggable in a selective manner. We designed TGP-377 to
   potently and specifically upregulate VEGFA in human umbilical vein
   endothelial cells. These studies illustrate the power of two-dimensional
   combinatorial screening to define molecular recognition events between
   `undruggable' biomolecules and small molecules, and the ability of
   sequence-based design to deliver efficacious structure-specific
   compounds.},

Title = {New records of a lost species and a geographic range expansion for
   sengis in the Horn of Africa},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {The Somali Sengi or Somali Elephant-shrew ('Elephantulus' revoilii,
   Macroscelidea, Mammalia) has been considered a ``lost species{''} and is
   primarily known from about 39 museum specimens, with no new vouchered
   occurrence records since the early 1970s. The scientific literature
   contains no data concerning living Somali Sengi individuals and the
   species' current Data Deficient conservation status is attributable to
   an absence of modern information. Almost everything that has been
   published about the species is derived from anatomical examinations of
   historic specimens, gleaned from museum collection notes, or inferred
   from the known habits and ecology of other sengi taxa. Here we report
   new evidence that the Somali Sengi is currently extant. These data
   include voucher specimens, georeferenced occurrence localities, body
   measurements, habitat parameters, and DNA sequences. While the species
   is historically documented as endemic to Somalia, these new records are
   from the neighboring Republic of Djibouti and thus expand the Somali
   Sengi's known range in the Horn of Africa. Furthermore, Djiboutian
   locality data near international borders suggests that the Somali Sengi
   is also a current inhabitant of both Somalia and Ethiopia. Criteria that
   inform conservation status assessments (e.g., suitable habitat
   contiguity and occurrence in wildlife protected areas) can be positively
   characterized in Djibouti and therefore bode well for the survival of
   the Somali Sengi species. New data also inform previously undocumented
   substrate and sheltering affiliations. DNA analyses indicate that the
   Somali Sengi is a descendant of the Macroscelidini lineage and therefore
   reveal that the species' referral to the genus Elephantulus is
   incompatible with sengi phylogeny. This taxonomic issue is resolved by
   recognizing a new genus replacement and recombinant binomial that
   redesignates the Somali Sengi as Galegeeska revoilii (gen. nov., nov.
   comb). An analysis of ancestral biogeography suggests that the Somali
   Sengi has inhabited the Horn of Africa for more than 5.4 million
   years-and the recognition of the species' phylogenetic ancestry appends
   the already remarkable biogeographic story of the Macroscelidini tribe.},

Abstract = {Pathogens are threatening crops worldwide, but little attention has been
   given to the threat to tree species in undisturbed rainforest. This
   communication reports the first case of a tree die off caused by a
   ``wilt{''} in Madagascar. In 2016 while monitoring monthly tree
   phenology of Ranomafana National Park (RNP), the Centre ValBio research
   station observed that manyCalophyllumadult trees had brown wilted
   leaves. There are three species ofCalophyllumin this rainforest,C.
   paniculatum,C. drouhardii, andC. milvum, and all three have contracted
   this pathogen. Our goal was to document the spead of this suspected wilt
   inCalophyllumtrees and determine if site, elevation and DBH had an
   influence on tree mortality. In 2019 we conducted an inventory of
   allCalophyllumtrees in RNP and 42\% of the observed trees were dead. The
   species with the highest mortality wasC. paniculatum, with 53\% of trees
   dead, followed byC. milvumwith 18\%, andC. drouhardiiwith only 2\% of
   surveyed trees dead. Bark beetle traces were observed in all
   deadCalophyllumtrees. Tree death caused by this suspected fungal
   pathogen has spread across a major river in the area and has been found
   at mid and high elevations. Our results show thatC. paniculatumtrees
   with a larger DBH have a higher mortality risk. Our report highlights
   the importance of fighting invasive pathogens that threaten protected
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The biological clock expresses circadian rhythms, whose endogenous
   period (tau) is close to 24 h. Daily resetting of the circadian clock to
   the 24 h natural photoperiod might induce marginal costs that would
   accumulate over time and forward affect fitness. It was proposed as the
   circadian resonance theory. For the first time, we aimed to evaluate
   these physiological and cognitive costs that would partially explain the
   mechanisms of the circadian resonance hypothesis. We evaluated the
   potential costs of imposing a 26 h photoperiodic regimen compared to the
   classical 24 h entrainment measuring several physiological and cognitive
   parameters (body temperature, energetic expenditure, oxidative stress,
   cognitive performances) in males of a non-human primate (Microcebus
   murinus), a nocturnal species whose endogenous period is about 23.5 h.
   We found significant higher resting body temperature and energy
   expenditure and lower cognitive performances when the photoperiodic
   cycle length was 26 h. Together these results suggest that a great
   deviation of external cycles from tau leads to daily greater energetic
   expenditure, and lower cognitive capacities. To our knowledge, this
   study is the first to highlight potential mechanisms of circadian
   resonance theory.},

Title = {Sleeping trees and sleep-related behaviours of the siamang (Symphalangus

Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Sleeping tree selection and related behaviours of a family group and a
   solitary female siamang (Symphalangus syndactylus) were investigated
   over a 5-month period in northern Sumatra, Indonesia. We performed all
   day follows, sleeping tree surveys and forest plot enumerations in the
   field. We tested whether: (1) physical characteristics of sleeping trees
   and the surrounding trees, together with siamang behaviours, supported
   selection based on predation risk and access requirements; (2) the
   preferences of a solitary siamang were similar to those of a family
   group; and (3) sleeping site locations within home ranges were
   indicative of home range defence, scramble competition with other groups
   or other species, or food requirements. Our data showed that (1)
   sleeping trees were tall, emergent trees with some, albeit low,
   connectivity to the neighbouring canopy, and that they were surrounded
   by other tall trees. Siamangs showed early entry into and departure from
   sleeping trees, and slept at the ends of branches. These results
   indicate that the siamangs' choice of sleeping trees and related
   behaviours were strongly driven by predator avoidance. The observed
   regular reuse of sleeping sites, however, did not support anti-predation
   theory. (2) The solitary female displayed selection criteria for
   sleeping trees that were similar to those of the family group, but she
   slept more frequently in smaller trees than the latter. (3) Siamangs
   selected sleeping trees to avoid neighbouring groups, monopolise
   resources (competition), and to be near their last feeding tree. Our
   findings indicate selectivity in the siamangs' use of sleeping trees,
   with only a few trees in the study site being used for this purpose. Any
   reduction in the availability of such trees might make otherwise
   suitable habitat unsuitable for these highly arboreal small apes.},

Abstract = {An iridium-catalyzed selectiveortho-monoiodination of benzoic acids with
   two equivalent C-H bonds is presented. A wide range of electron-rich and
   electron-poor substrates undergo the reaction under mild conditions,
   with >20:1 mono/di selectivity. Importantly, the C-H iodination occurs
   selectivelyorthoto the carboxylic acid moiety in substrates bearing
   competing coordinating directing groups. The reaction is performed at
   room temperature and no inert atmosphere or exclusion of moisture is
   required. Mechanistic investigations revealed a substrate-dependent
   reversible C-H activation/protodemetalation step, a substrate-dependent
   turnover-limiting step, and the crucial role of the Ag(I)additive in the
   deactivation of the iodination product towards further reaction.},

Title = {Design, delivery and perception of condition-dependent chemical signals
   in strepsirrhine primates: implications for human olfactory
   communication},

Month = {JUN 8},
Abstract = {The study of human chemical communication benefits from comparative
   perspectives that relate humans, conceptually and empirically, to other
   primates. All major primate groups rely on intraspecific chemosignals,
   but strepsirrhines present the greatest diversity and specialization,
   providing a rich framework for examining design, delivery and
   perception. Strepsirrhines actively scent mark, possess a functional
   vomeronasal organ, investigate scents via olfactory and gustatory means,
   and are exquisitely sensitive to chemically encoded messages. Variation
   in delivery, scent mixing and multimodality alters signal detection,
   longevity and intended audience. Based on an integrative, 19-species
   review, the main scent source used (excretory versus glandular)
   differentiates nocturnal from diurnal or cathemeral species, reflecting
   differing socioecological demands and evolutionary trajectories.
   Condition-dependent signals reflect immutable (species, sex, identity,
   genetic diversity, immunity and kinship) and transient (health, social
   status, reproductive state and breeding history) traits, consistent with
   socio-reproductive functions. Sex reversals in glandular elaboration,
   marking rates or chemical richness in female-dominant species implicate
   sexual selection of olfactory ornaments in both sexes. Whereas some
   compounds may be endogenously produced and modified (e.g. via hormones),
   microbial analyses of different odorants support the fermentation
   hypothesis of bacterial contribution. The intimate contexts of
   information transfer and varied functions provide important parallels
   applicable to olfactory communication in humans. This article is part of
   the Theo Murphy meeting issue `Olfactory communication in humans'.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {100},

Abstract = {The neuroendocrine system (NES) plays a crucial role in synchronizing
   the physiology and behavior of the whole organism in response to
   environmental constraints. The NES consists of a
   hypothalamic-pituitary-target organ axis that acts in coordination to
   regulate growth, reproduction, stress and basal metabolism. The growth
   (or somatotropic), hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG),
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid
   (HPT) axes are therefore finely tuned by the hypothalamus through the
   successive release of hypothalamic and pituitary hormones to control the
   downstream physiological functions. These functions rely on a complex
   set of mechanisms requiring tight synchronization between peripheral
   organs and the hypothalamic-pituitary complex, whose functionality can
   be altered during aging. Here, we review the results of research on the
   effects of aging on the NES of nonhuman primate (NHP) species in wild
   and captive conditions. A focus on the age-related dysregulation of the
   master circadian pacemaker, which, in turn, alters the synchronization
   of the NES with the organism environment, is proposed. Finally,
   practical and ethical considerations of using NHP models to test the
   effects of nutrition-based or hormonal treatments to combat the
   deterioration of the NES are discussed.},

Title = {Suspended in time: Molecular responses to hibernation also promote
   longevity},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aging in most animals is an inevitable process that causes or is a
   result of physiological, biochemical, and molecular changes in the body,
   and has a strong influence on an organism's lifespan. Although
   advancement in medicine has allowed humans to live longer, the
   prevalence of age-associated medical complications is continuously
   burdening older adults worldwide. Current animal models used in research
   to study aging have provided novel information that has helped
   investigators understand the aging process; however, these models are
   limiting. Aging is a complex process that is regulated at multiple
   biological levels, and while a single manipulation in these models can
   provide information on a process, it is not enough to understand the
   global regulation of aging. Some mammalian hibernators live up to
   9.8-times higher than their expected average lifespan, and new research
   attributes this increase to their ability to hibernate. A common theme
   amongst these mammalian hibernators is their ability to greatly reduce
   their metabolic rate to a fraction of their normal rate and initiate
   cytoprotective responses that enable their survival. Metabolic rate
   depression is strictly regulated at different biological levels in order
   to enable the animal to not only survive, but to also do so by relying
   mainly on their limited internal fuels. As such, understanding both the
   global and specific regulatory mechanisms used to promote survival
   during hibernation could, in theory, allow investigators to have a
   better understanding of the aging process. This can also allow
   pharmaceutical industries to find therapeutics that could delay or
   reverse age-associated medical complications and promote healthy aging
   and longevity in humans.},

Title = {Non-synthetic European low voltage test system},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {118},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The use and development of standard test systems has been critical for
   testing all kind of algorithms, operation procedures and planning
   purposes in transmission and distribution networks. With the irruption
   of advanced metering infrastructure based among others on smart meter
   technology, distribution systems suffered a drastic modernization in
   many regions of the world. The smart grid concept translated to the
   terminal distribution systems implies a drastic change of paradigm in
   the way these kinds of systems have been planned and operated. Although
   there are several distribution test systems, most of them are synthetic
   and there are very few test feeders and networks representing the
   European style distribution system. In this paper, a real
   (non-synthetic) comprehensive distribution test network representing a
   typical European town's network is presented. The model also features a
   provisioning mechanism to incorporate smart meter data obtained from the
   consumer's meter in order to study the distribution network status. This
   test network will provide a tool that allows researchers to work on
   algorithms and optimization of resources for European style distribution
   systems. The test network also demonstrates the impact of neutral
   voltage in European style distribution networks. Both researchers and
   the distribution company provide with the raw data extracted from the
   GIS system and all the functions to convert the data into an OpenDSS

Abstract = {Madagascar is a global biodiversity hotspot of conservation concern. The
   decline of natural forest habitats due to shifting cultivation has been
   one of the major land use changes during the last decades. We analyzed
   satellite images between 1990 and 2018 from northeastern Madagascar to
   evaluate the contribution of nine variables (e.g., topographic,
   demographic, forest protection) to explain past forest loss, predict
   future deforestation probabilities to define important areas that
   require further conservation attention. Forest cover declined by 21\%
   since 1990 and the once continuous rain forest belt of the region is
   disrupted twice, in the center and at the southern limit of the study
   region. Status of forest protection and proximity to the forest edge
   were identified as most important predictors, but all variables
   contributed to explaining the observed pattern of deforestation. At
   least 20\% of the 3136 villages in the area were established since 1990
   at the expense of previously forested areas. This housing sprawl was
   mainly driven by accessibility, decreasing landscape connectivity. To
   conserve the unique biodiversity of the region, the expansion of
   protected forests and active reforestation measures are urgently needed.
   Sustainable land use planning and forest management integrating the
   needs of local land users and conservation priorities should be
   promoted. We see the highest potential for external stakeholders (e.g.,
   national NGOs) to implement targeted interventions embedded in
   community-based approaches. Our land cover maps and predictive modeling
   highlight crucial areas that could act as stepping stone habitats for
   dispersing or retreating species and therefore important locations to
   intensify conservation measures.},

Title = {Ambient Temperature Cycles Affect Daily Torpor and Hibernation Patterns
   in Malagasy Tenrecs},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {Hibernation and daily torpor (heterothermy) allow endotherms to cope
   with demanding environmental conditions. The depth and duration of
   torpor bouts vary considerably between tropical and temperate climates,
   and tropical hibernators manage to cope with a wider spectrum of ambient
   temperature (T-a) regimes during heterothermy. As cycles inT(a)can have
   profound effects on activity and torpor patterns as well as energy
   expenditure, we examined how these characteristics are affected by daily
   fluctuating versus constantT(a)in a tropical hibernator, the lesser
   hedgehog tenrec (Echinops telfairi). Throughout the study, regardless of
   season, the tenrecs became torpid every day. In summer,E. telfairiused
   daily fluctuations inT(a)to passively rewarm from daily torpor, which
   led to synchrony in the activity phases and torpor bouts between
   individuals and generally decreased energy expenditure. In contrast,
   animals housed at constantT(a)showed considerable variation in timing
   and they had to invest more energy through endogenous heat production.
   During the hibernation season (winter)E. telfairihibernated for several
   months in constant, as well as in fluctuatingT(a)and, as in summer,
   under fluctuatingT(a)arousals were much more uniform and showed less
   variation in timing compared to constant temperature regimes. The timing
   of torpor is not only important for its effective use, but
   synchronization of activity patterns could also be essential for social
   interactions, and successful foraging bouts. Our results highlight
   thatT(a)cycles can be an effectivezeitgeberfor activity and
   thermoregulatory rhythms throughout the year and that consideration
   should be given to the choice of temperature regime when studying
   heterothermy under laboratory conditions.},

Title = {Sex and age differences in tree cavity dependence in a small arboreal

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {312},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-62},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Many mammal species depend on tree cavities for shelter and for
   breeding. Some species may use tree cavities as well as other varied
   shelters, but the extent of their dependence on tree cavities is
   unknown. One such species is the eastern pygmy-possum (Cercartetus
   nanus) from eastern Australia which typically shelters alone. Four key
   questions were addressed: (1) do different age and sex classes differ in
   their preferences for small (4 cm diameter) and large (10 cm diameter)
   cavities, (2) does the availability of large cavities influence female
   breeding status, (3) does the availability of large cavities influence
   where adult females and males are detected, and (4) does the
   availability of large cavities influence survival and abundance? Two
   9-ha plots containing few (<= 2 per ha) `large' natural cavities were
   provisioned with artificial cavities in different years. When plots were
   provisioned with small and large cavities, breeding females (n = 46)
   showed a pronounced preference for sheltering in the large cavities
   while adult males (n = 67) and subadults (n = 40) preferred the small
   cavities. When one plot and not the other was provisioned with large
   cavities, adult females were significantly more likely to be
   reproductive and be detected on the plot with large cavities, but
   survival was not influenced. Detection of adult males did not vary with
   large cavity provisioning. The abundance of adult pygmy-possums varied
   among years, being higher on the plot provisioned with large cavities
   when the other plot was not provisioned, but equivalent when both were
   provisioned. The findings of this study are consistent with the
   hypothesis that breeding females are dependent on a large cavity to
   raise a litter. Other mammal species around the world are likely to
   exhibit similar but currently unrecognized shelter site strategies which
   have implications for their management.},

Abstract = {The masticatory apparatus has been the focus of many studies in
   comparative anatomy-especially analyses of skulls and teeth, but also of
   the mandibular adductor muscles which are responsible for the production
   of bite force and the movements of the mandible during food processing
   and transport. The fiber architecture of these muscles has been
   correlated to specific diets (e.g., prey size in felids) and modes of
   foraging (e.g., tree gouging in marmosets). Despite the well-elucidated
   functional implications of this architecture, little is known about its
   ontogeny. To characterize age-related myological changes, we studied the
   masticatory muscles in a large (n = 33) intraspecific sample of a small,
   Malagasy primate, Microcebus murinus including neonatal through
   geriatric individuals. We removed each of the mandibular adductors and
   recorded its mass as well as other linear measurements. We then
   chemically dissected each muscle to study its architecture-fascicle
   length and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) which relate to
   stretch (gape) and force capabilities, respectively. We observed PCSA
   and muscle mass to increase rapidly and plateau in adulthood through
   senescence. Fascicle lengths remained relatively constant once maximal
   length was reached, which occurred early in life, suggesting that
   subsequent changes in PCSA are driven by changes in muscle mass.
   Quadratic curvilinear models of each of the architectural variables of
   all adductors combined as well as individual muscles regressed against
   age were all significant. Anat Rec, 303:1364-1373, 2020. (c) 2019

Title = {Evidence of the Role of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Brain
   Glucose Metabolism},
Journal = {NUTRIENTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In mammals, brain function, particularly neuronal activity, has high
   energy needs. When glucose is supplemented by alternative oxidative
   substrates under different physiological conditions, these fuels do not
   fully replace the functions fulfilled by glucose. Thus, it is of major
   importance that the brain is almost continuously supplied with glucose
   from the circulation. Numerous studies describe the decrease in brain
   glucose metabolism during healthy or pathological ageing, but little is
   known about the mechanisms that cause such impairment. Although it
   appears difficult to determine the exact role of brain glucose
   hypometabolism during healthy ageing or during age-related
   neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, uninterrupted
   glucose supply to the brain is still of major importance for proper
   brain function. Interestingly, a body of evidence suggests that dietary
   n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) might play significant roles in
   brain glucose regulation. Thus, the goal of the present review is to
   summarize this evidence and address the role of n-3 PUFAs in brain
   energy metabolism. Taken together, these data suggest that ensuring an
   adequate dietary supply of n-3 PUFAs could constitute an essential
   aspect of a promising strategy to promote optimal brain function during
   both healthy and pathological ageing.},

Abstract = {Spontaneous animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) offer the
   potential to bridge the translational gulf between promising rodent
   studies and failed human clinical trials. In this review, the
   relationship between cell biology, neuropathology, clinical phenotype
   and biomarker progression in human AD is summarized. Genetically altered
   animals have provided key insights into the cell biology of AD and,
   together with emerging stem cell systems, remain the most effective
   means to disentangle the entwined mechanisms that underlie AD.
   Translating therapeutic success from these models of familial AD to late
   onset human AD has been challenging. Spontaneous models of AD do not
   harbor AD-associated mutations and could potentially be used to
   demonstrate greater generalizability of new therapies to late onset AD.
   The value of such models has been advanced primarily on the basis of
   similar amyloid (and far less frequent, tangle) neuropathology. While
   these models are promising, this alone is insufficient for use of these
   models to assess efficacy of potential therapies. The correlation
   between progression of neuropathology and cognitive phenotype and the
   association of these with biomarker progression in these models is
   discussed, with an emphasis on the dog and non-human primates.
   Currently, interventional studies using these models are hampered by use
   of a variety of outcomes that are not easily comparable with those used
   in human trials and do not permit longitudinal assessment. Additional
   studies aimed at closing the gap between neuropathology and usable
   outcome measures would support more accurate subject selection,
   assessment of target engagement and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy.},

Title = {Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein Cirp, but not Rbm3, may regulate
   transcript processing and protection in tissues of the hibernating
   ground squirrel},

Abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have important roles in transcription,
   pre-mRNA processing/transport, mRNA degradation, translation, and
   non-coding RNA processing, among others. RBPs that are expressed in
   response to cold stress, such as Cirp and Rbm3, could regulate RNA
   stability and translation in hibernating mammals that reduce their body
   temperatures from 37 degrees C to as low as 0-5 degrees C during torpor
   bouts. RBPs including Cirp, Rbm3, and stress-inducible HuR translocate
   from the nucleus to stabilize mRNAs in the cytoplasm, and thereby could
   regulate which mRNA transcripts are protected from degradation and are
   translated, versus stored, for future protein synthesis or degraded by
   nucleases during cell stress associated with metabolic rate depression.
   This is the first study to explore the transcriptional/translational
   regulation, and subcellular localization of cold-inducible RBPs in a
   model hibernator, the 13-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys
   tridecemlineatus). Cirp protein levels were upregulated in liver,
   skeletal muscle, and brown adipose tissue throughout the torpor-arousal
   cycle whereas Rbm3 protein levels stayed constant or decreased,
   suggesting an important role for Cirp, but likely not Rbm3, in the
   hibernator stress response. Increased cytoplasmic localization of Cirp
   in liver and muscle and HuR in liver during torpor, but no changes in
   the relative levels of Rbm3 in the cytoplasm, emphasizes a role for Cirp
   and possibly HuR in regulating mRNA processing during torpor. This study
   informs our understanding of the natural adaptations that extreme
   animals use in the face of stress, and highlight natural stress response
   mediators that could be used to bolster cryoprotection of human organs
   donated for transplant.},

Title = {Masticatory Loading and Ossification of the Mandibular Symphysis during
   Anthropoid Origins},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {An ossified or `fused' mandibular symphysis characterizes the origins of
   the Anthropoidea, a primate suborder that includes humans. Longstanding
   debate about the adaptive significance of variation in this jaw joint
   centers on whether a bony symphysis is stronger than an unfused one
   spanned by cartilage and ligaments. To provide essential information
   regarding mechanical performance, intact adult symphyses from
   representative primates and scandentians were loaded ex vivo to simulate
   stresses during biting and chewing - dorsoventral (DV) shear and lateral
   transverse bending ('wishboning'). The anthropoid symphysis requires
   significantly more force to induce structural failure vs. strepsirrhines
   and scandentians with unfused joints. In wishboning, symphyseal breakage
   always occurs at the midline in taxa with unfused conditions, further
   indicating that an ossified symphysis is stronger than an unfused joint.
   Greater non-midline fractures among anthropoids suggest that fusion
   imposes unique constraints on masticatory function elsewhere along the
   mandible, a phenomenon likely to characterize the evolution of fusion
   and jaw form throughout Mammalia.},

Title = {Modeling of Magnetic Elements Including Losses-Application to Variable
   Inductor},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper proposes and develops a circuit-based model aiming to
   simulate variable magnetic power elements in power electronic
   converters. The derived model represents the magnetic element by a
   reluctance-based equivalent circuit. The model takes into consideration
   device core losses, with the main emphasis given to hysteresis losses,
   which are modeled using the Jiles-Atherton model. The core loss model is
   further validated on different ferromagnetic materials to prove its
   range of applicability. The winding losses of the magnetic device are
   also taken into consideration, which are obtained using Dowell empirical
   formulas. In addition, the frequency dependence of the device losses is
   also considered. The proposed modeling procedure has been applied to
   study and characterize a double E-core variable power inductor structure
   in a 1 kW SiC full bridge DC-DC converter. The procedure has been
   verified by comparing the simulation results to the experimental
   measurements, confirming the validity and accuracy of the full
   circuit-based model.},

Title = {Variable Climates Lead to Varying Phenotypes: ``Weird{''} Mammalian
   Torpor and Lessons From Non-Holarctic Species},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {Mammalian heterotherms, species that employ short or long periods of
   torpor, are found in many different climatic regions. Although the
   underlying physiological mechanisms of heterothermy in species from
   lower latitudes (i.e., the tropics and southern hemisphere) appear
   analogous to those of temperate and arctic heterotherms, the ultimate
   triggers and resulting patterns of energy expenditure and body
   temperature are often noticeably different. Phenotypic flexibility in
   the patterns of thermoregulation in non-Holarctic species can be
   extensive (depending on body condition, environmental parameters and
   species competition) and the factors responsible for inducing
   heterothermy are more variable in non-Holarctic species. As well as
   being a regular adaptation to seasonality, heterothermy can also be
   employed as a response to unpredictability in environmental parameters
   and as a response to emergency situations. Non-Holarctic heterotherms
   also challenge the notion that regular inter-bout arousals during
   hibernation are obligatory and suggest all that is necessary to maintain
   proper functioning during hibernation is an occasional passive return
   to-or maintenance of-a relatively high body temperature. The study of
   non-Holarctic heterotherms has led to the conclusion that heterothermy
   must be defined on the basis of mechanistic, physiological parameters,
   and not solely by body temperature; yet we are still limited in our
   abilities to record such mechanistic parameters in the field. It is now
   believed that homeothermy in mammals evolved in hot climates via an
   ancestral heterothermic state. Similar to extant warm-climate
   heterotherms, early mammals could have relied mainly on passive body
   temperature regulation with a capacity for short- to longer-term
   up-regulation of metabolism when needed. Hibernation, as seen in
   temperate and arctic species may then be a derived state of this
   ancestral heterothermy, and the study of torpor in warm climates can
   provide potential models for the energetics of early mammals.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {During the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods, the Earth experienced
   tectonic and climatic changes, which included continental drift
   following the breakup of the supercontinents Gondwana and Laurasia, the
   end-Cretaceous mass extinction event, and several climatic events,
   including the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum and the Middle Eocene
   Climatic Optimum. In response to increased temperatures and vacancies of
   ecospace left by the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, mammal and
   reptile lineages that survived into the Eocene underwent immense
   evolutionary radiations that led to the diversification of crown clades,
   such as Crocodylia. Late Eocene deposits in northern Africa provide
   insights into how crocodyliforms responded to these tectonic and
   climatic events. Specifically, the Birket Qarun Formation in the Fayum
   Depression of Egypt contains several species of crown crocodylians as
   part of its rich fossil record of vertebrates. This study provides
   description of new material attributable to crocodylian taxa previously
   known from this formation, as well as newly recognized non-crocodylian
   mesoeucrocodylian material referable to Sebecosuchia. The sebecosuchian
   material provides important evidence attesting to the diversity of
   crocodyliforms in the late Eocene of Africa and expands the known
   biogeographic range of sebecosuchians.},

   new hot loop mimicking modality, termed PepNats, in which natural
   product (NP)-inspired structures are incorporated as
   conformation-determining and-restricting structural elements into
   macrocyclic hot loop-derived peptides. Macrocyclic PepNats representing
   hot loops of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and human
   agouti-related protein (AGRP) were synthesized on solid support
   employing macro-cyclization by imine formation and subsequent
   stereoselective 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition as key steps. PepNats derived
   from the iNOS DINNN hot loop and the AGRP RFF hot spot sequence yielded
   novel and potent ligands of the SPRY domain-containing SOCS box protein
   2 (SPSB2) that binds to iNOS, and selective ligands for AGRP-binding
   melanocortin (MC) receptors. NP-inspired fragment absolute configuration
   determines the conformation of the peptide part responsible for binding.
   These results demonstrate that combination of NP-inspired scaffolds with
   peptidic epitopes enables identification of novel hot loop mimics with
   conformationally constrained and biologically relevant structure.},

Title = {Why Care: Complex Evolutionary History of Human Healthcare Networks},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB 13},
Abstract = {One of the striking features of human social complexity is that we
   provide care to sick and contagious individuals, rather than avoiding
   them. Care-giving is a powerful strategy of disease control in human
   populations today; however, we are not the only species which provides
   care for the sick. Widespread reports occurring in distantly related
   species like cetaceans and insects suggest that the building blocks of
   care for the sick are older than the human lineage itself. This raises
   the question of what evolutionary processes drive the evolution of such
   care in animals, including humans. I synthesize data from the literature
   to evaluate the diversity of care-giving behaviors and conclude that
   across the animal kingdom there appear to be two distinct types of
   care-behaviors, both with separate evolutionary histories: (1) social
   care behaviors benefitting a sick individual by promoting healing and
   recovery and (2) community health behaviors that control pathogens in
   the environment and reduce transmission within the population. By
   synthesizing literature from psychology, anthropology, and biology, I
   develop a novel hypothesis (Hominin Pathogen Control Hypothesis) to
   explain how these two distinct sets of behaviors evolved independently
   then merged in the human lineage. The hypothesis suggests that social
   care evolved in association with offspring care systems whereas
   community health behaviors evolved as a type of niche construction.
   These two types of behaviors merged in humans to produce complex,
   multi-level healthcare networks in humans. Moreover, each type of care
   increases selection for the other, generating feedback loops that
   selected for increasing healthcare behaviors over time. Interestingly,
   domestication processes may have contributed to both social care and
   community health aspects of this process.},

Abstract = {Non-human primates (NHPs) can adapt to conditions outside of their
   natural habitat and climatic ranges but this can be influenced by
   inherent evolutionary traits or plasticity of species that evolved in
   diverse environmental conditions. In this study, we investigated how
   five species of NHPs that have natural distributions across a range of
   climatic conditions responded to seasonal temperature changes in a
   captive environment. The activity levels of NHPs were affected by
   temperature changes over the season, where activity levels were
   generally reduced at the lower and higher temperature ranges. Species
   that are naturally found within narrower and warmer climatic ranges,
   compared to those found in colder environments with wider fluctuations
   in temperature, showed more marked changes in activity levels in
   response to temperature changes. In lower temperature conditions, three
   out of five species showed significantly lower activity levels; whereas
   in higher temperature conditions, the activity levels of all species did
   not significantly decrease. The frequency of thermoregulation behaviours
   was higher, and use of artificial thermoregulatory sources lower, for
   species that did not substantially adjust their activity levels in
   different temperature conditions. Our results suggest that NHPs largely
   retained the evolutionary traits related to thermoregulation, according
   to the different ambient conditions they evolved in and may have low
   behavioural plasticity in adapting to conditions outside of their
   natural ranges. These results provide insights for improving
   conservation and captive management and may have implications for
   understanding NHP resilience to the increasing impact of global climate
   change.},

Journal = {COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR \& INTEGRATIVE

Year = {2020},
Volume = {240},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Evolution has produced animals that survive extreme fluctuations in
   environmental conditions including freezing temperatures, anoxia,
   desiccating conditions, and prolonged periods without food. For example,
   the wood frog survives whole-body freezing every winter, arresting all
   gross physiological functions, but recovers functions upon thawing in
   the spring. Likewise, many small mammals hibernate for months at a time
   with minimal metabolic activity, organ perfusion, and movement, yet do
   not suffer significant muscle atrophy upon arousal. These conditions and
   the biochemical adaptations employed to deal with them can be viewed as
   Nature's answer to problems that humans wish to answer, particularly in
   a biomedical context. This review focuses on recent advances in the
   field of animal environmental stress adaptation, starting with an
   emphasis on new areas of research such as epigenetics and microRNA. We
   then examine new and emerging technologies such as genome editing, novel
   sequencing applications, and single cell analysis and how these can push
   us closer to a deeper understanding of biochemical adaptation. Next,
   evaluate the potential contributions of new high-throughput technologies
   (e.g. next-generation sequencing, mass spectrometry proteomics) to
   better understanding the adaptations that support these extreme
   phenotypes. Concluding, we examine some of the human applications that
   can be gained from understanding the principles of biochemical
   adaptation including organ preservation and treatments for conditions
   such as ischemic stroke and muscle disuse atrophy.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of cell phones and the growing culture of constant
   connectivity has introduced a plethora of new challenges for mobile
   citizens. One of the major challenges transportation professionals
   desire to address involves the use of cell phones to text while driving,
   especially for less experienced drivers. In this study, the Theory of
   Planned Behavior (TPB) in conjunction with psycho-social factors is
   utilized to explore the intention to text while driving among young
   drivers. The results of a survey administered to 524 drivers suggest
   that the TPB constructs (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived
   behavioral control) along with the perceived disadvantages of abstention
   and age of the driver explain a significant amount of variance in the
   intention to send text messages while driving (adjusted R-2 = 0.71).},

Title = {Model vs. playback experiments: The impact of sensory mode on
   predator-specific escape responses in saki monkeys},
Journal = {ETHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {126},
Number = {5},
Pages = {563-575},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Although experimentally simulating predator presence helps improve
   sample sizes in studies of free-ranging animals, few studies have
   examined whether auditory playbacks and visual models produce similar
   results. Additionally, it is unclear if anti-predator strategies are
   specific to predator hunting styles in understudied Neotropical
   pitheciid primates, limiting what we can generalize about this
   phenomenon across this taxonomic order. We conducted predator simulation
   experiments to assess whether wild Rylands' bald-faced saki monkeys
   (Pithecia rylandsi) recognize predators based solely on acoustic cues,
   exhibit predator-specific responses to different predator types, and
   vary responses to presentations in different sensory modes. In our
   playback experiments, sakis had weak responses to non-predator control
   vocalizations compared to jaguar growls and harpy eagle shrieks. In most
   predator playbacks, subjects' first glance corresponded to the direction
   from which simulated predators would typically attack (above vs. below).
   However, although sakis exhibited appropriate movement responses to
   harpy playbacks (i.e., descending canopy), they exhibited no clear
   movement patterns when presented with jaguar playbacks. In contrast,
   jaguar model experiments consistently elicited fast approaches,
   mobbing-style responses, and long alarm calling bouts. Thus, if we had
   relied on playbacks alone, we might have concluded that sakis have only
   generalized responses to terrestrial ambush predators. In fact, in all
   variables measured (e.g., latency, number of calls, and response
   duration), models of both predator species elicited stronger reactions
   than playbacks. Results indicate that bald-faced sakis can identify
   predators based solely on vocalizations, but do not exhibit
   predator-specific escape responses to terrestrial predators based on
   acoustic cues alone. The differential response to playbacks and models
   calls into question the reliability of using acoustic-only stimuli to
   assess the specificity of anti-predator behavior to predator hunting
   styles in some primate species.},

Abstract = {DC microgrids with integrated distributed generators (DGs) require
   island detection in all converters. This work proposes an impedance
   estimation strategy to detect the grid connection status among all
   active participants in the DC microgrid. The method is based on a pulse
   signal injection (PSI) combined with the recursive least squares (RLS)
   algorithm to estimate the equivalent parallel resistance and capacitance
   of the components connected to the DC bus (both active and passive).
   This technique allows to detect islanding conditions by using the
   estimated capacitance value as a reliable metric. Compared with the
   existing DC island detection technology, this method: 1) does not have a
   non-detection region; 2) has a little impact on the DC bus voltage; 3)
   provides simultaneous islanding detection for all converters of the DC
   microgrid and 4) avoids using a dedicated communication layer. The
   method is verified in single and multi-converter scenarios.},

Abstract = {The ever growing energy demand due to population growth, higher
   penetration of electric vehicles and smart appliances, as well as
   superior living standards, is a demanding incentive to the better
   utilization of conventional and renewable energy systems. Moreover, to
   facilitate the emerging requirements of prosumers to participate in the
   electricity market and monetise their efforts towards distributed energy
   deployment, traditional centralised energy trading architectures are no
   longer viable. In this context, blockchain-based ledger technology
   emerges as the most feasible solution which offers a peer to peer (P2P)
   energy trading platform providing a unique distributed local energy
   market model for beneficial energy exchanges among participants. This
   will represent a significant evolution for future smart grids. In this
   regard, this work provides a ground understanding as well as all the
   necessary technical details and procedures required to implement a
   pilot-platform P2P energy trading system based on blockchain technology.

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This work presents a fault ride-through control scheme for a
   non-isolated power topology used in a hybrid energy storage system
   designed for DC microgrids. The hybrid system is formed by a lithium-ion
   battery bank and a supercapacitor module, both coordinated to achieve a
   high-energy and high-power combined storage system. This hybrid system
   is connected to a DC bus that manages the power flow of the microgrid.
   The power topology under consideration is based on the buck-boost
   bidirectional converter, and it is controlled through a bespoke
   modulation scheme to obtain low losses at nominal operation. The
   operation of the proposed control scheme during a DC bus short-circuit
   failure is shown, as well as a modification to the standard control to
   achieve fault ride-through capability once the fault is over. The
   proposed control provides a protection to the energy storage systems and
   the converter itself during the DC bus short-circuit fault. The
   operation of the converter is developed theoretically, and it has been
   verified through both simulations and experimental validation on a built
   prototype.},

Abstract = {Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)-based fingerprinting is
   currently viewed as an important technique for the positioning
   capabilities in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, in the case of
   practical measurement, the localization methods based on RSSI are easily
   affected by the temporal and spatial variation, which contributes to
   most of the estimation errors in current systems. In this paper, the
   feasibility of utilizing the Channel State Information (CSI) for
   localization is studied, after knowing that the CSI contains information
   about the channel between the sender and receiver at the level of
   individual data subcarriers. Unlike most of the previous work, the
   intended approach is to use the entire subcarrier magnitudes without
   averaging or any reduction of the obtained narrowband CSI. Moreover, the
   frequency hopping in the LoRa systems should be a profit for
   localization by getting access to a wider band. In order to obtain a
   reliable basis for this approach, an outdoor measurement campaign is
   performed in the area of the Campus Beaulieu in Rennes to estimate the
   CSI of transmitted LoRa signals from different locations. For this, it
   is necessary for the individual channels from each different position to
   be appropriately different from one another to achieve significant
   localization gain. Hence, a comparison is done investigating the
   attainable evolution in the CSI at each location based on the CSI slope
   versus its average amplitude. In the given results, the feasibility of
   using the proposed technique is asserted by the drastic stability of the
   CSI slope over time and space, in contrary to the CSI average amplitude.
   This manifests the robustness of the CSI to the signal fluctuations and
   its more valuable rendering than the RSSI.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the sharing control scheme for a Hybrid
   48V/375V/400Vac AC/DC Microgrid, considering reliability as one of the
   key factors. For that purpose, different possible paths for energy flow
   provide redundancy to the grid. However, this redundancy leads to the
   need of enhanced coordinated control systems that can enable these
   alternative paths for the energy flow. In this paper, both the dc and ac
   grids are controlled by a P/V droop strategy. At the ac grid, this
   assumes a main resistive component in the distribution line impedance.
   The droop control voltage error in steady state is compensated by a
   novel and simple secondary control approach. The proposed control
   strategy is based on the calculation of the optimum power flow in each
   operating point and the real-time modification of the droop
   characteristics of the converters involved in the power flow
   calculation. The proposed control is also capable of eliminating the
   induced voltage drop when using virtual impedance and incorporating any
   power sharing criteria for the converters contributing to the power
   production.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a multi-issue bargaining mechanism in order to
   negotiate simultaneously the price and time-slot for electric vehicles
   (EVs) charging in congested power distribution networks. Alleviating the

   chargers, an aggregator coordinating EVs provides flexibility to the
   system and reduces congestion. The proposed negotiation algorithm is
   based on well known Rubinstein alternating offers which is implemented
   and tested using a simple case scenario between EV and aggregator.
   Results achieved validates application of proposed negotiation mechanism
   for EV charging systems. Moreover, the general detailed description of
   the protocol as well as the implemented utility functions in this paper
   could expand its viability for more complex applications.},

   week's worth of TEC data was collected from Spire's constellation of
   low-Earth orbiting micro-satellites carrying GNSS receivers and
   assimilated into GPSII. GPSII operation with the data was evaluated and
   the results were validated with observations from independent sources.
   Ground-based ionosondes were employed in diagnosing the accuracy of the
   derived models; NWRA studied the differences between the F2 peak
   parameters (f(0)F(2) and HmF2) derived from ionograms and those computed
   with GPSII. The analysis showed that Spire's TEC data was both
   compatible for ingestion into GPSII and that the assimilation of the
   data improved the comparison to ground-based ionosondes. On average
   f(0)F(2) was improved by 1.317 MHz and HmF2 was improved by 22.8 km with

Abstract = {Simulation tools are essential for designing and sizing the
   infrastructure and operation of electrical railway systems. With the
   advent of innovative solutions to save energy, the accuracy of estimates
   of energy consumptions and voltages must be increased, while keeping
   fast computing capabilities. Due to the numerous non-linearities of this
   kind of system, complex iterative solvers are often used. However, a new
   simulation technique based on switched models for the different
   subsystems has recently been developed for conventional DC traction
   systems with non-reversible traction power substations (TPS). This
   technique avoids the use of complex numerical solvers. This paper
   extends this simulation approach to include reversible TPS using
   Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR). Simulations are carried out
   and an energy saving of 7 \% on the total energy consumption is allowed
   by the reversible TPS for the studied case.},

Abstract = {The motivation of this work is the characterization of semiconductor
   switches in DC/DC Wide Band-Gap based converters for electrical vehicle
   applications. The paper studies Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility
   (GaN HEMT) Transistors, which present very good features for
   high-frequency high-efficiency applications. In order to obtain an
   efficient DC/DC converter design, a full characterization of these
   devices must be carried out. A double pulse test is applied to the GaN
   device, in order to study the switching behavior of these transistors.
   The test will be performed experimentally and in simulation under
   different operating conditions, in order to have the ability to
   understand the difference in the transistor behavior under these
   different operating points. Finally, the obtained results will be
   presented, commented},

Abstract = {The health benefits of chronic caloric restriction (CR) resulting in
   lifespan extension are well established in many species and has been
   recently demonstrated also in non-human primates, but its effects in
   humans remain to be proven on a long-term basis. CR might be a very
   efficient anti-aging strategy but its definition and limits must be well
   understood before envisaging to apply it to human. In this review, we
   first report and compare the recently issued CR studies in non-human
   primates and humans and then try to understand what an optimal caloric
   intake is. In a last part, we will discuss the pertinence of using CR as
   an anti-aging strategy with respect to the risks of frailty and obesity.},

Title = {Kinesin light chain-1 serine-460 phosphorylation is altered in
   Alzheimer's disease and regulates axonal transport and processing of the
   amyloid precursor protein},
Journal = {ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},

Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Damage to axonal transport is an early pathogenic event in Alzheimer's
   disease. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a key axonal transport
   cargo since disruption to APP transport promotes amyloidogenic
   processing of APP. Moreover, altered APP processing itself disrupts
   axonal transport. The mechanisms that regulate axonal transport of APP
   are therefore directly relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. APP
   is transported anterogradely through axons on kinesin-1 motors and one
   route for this transport involves calsyntenin-1, a type-1 membrane
   spanning protein that acts as a direct ligand for kinesin-1 light chains
   (KLCs). Thus, loss of calsyntenin-1 disrupts APP axonal transport and
   promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Phosphorylation of KLC1 on
   serine-460 has been shown to reduce anterograde axonal transport of
   calsyntenin-1 by inhibiting the KLC1-calsyntenin-1 interaction. Here we
   demonstrate that in Alzheimer's disease frontal cortex, KLC1 levels are
   reduced and the relative levels of KLC1 serine-460 phosphorylation are
   increased; these changes occur relatively early in the disease process.
   We also show that a KLC1 serine-460 phosphomimetic mutant inhibits
   axonal transport of APP in both mammalian neurons in culture and in
   Drosophila neurons in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of
   the KLC1 serine-460 phosphomimetic mutant promotes amyloidogenic
   processing of APP. Together, these results suggest that increased KLC1
   serine-460 phosphorylation contributes to Alzheimer's disease.},

Abstract = {Limiting resources often differ between males and females. Reproductive
   success in females is constrained by resources such as food and shelter,
   while the availability of receptive females determines male reproductive
   success. In addition to limiting resources, low intra-sexual tolerances
   among females can affect their spacing. High intolerances coinciding
   with low population densities have been suggested as a cause for the
   evolution of monogamy in mammals, but the evidence for female
   intolerance is limited. We investigated long-term space use patterns
   (measured as home range sizes and centers of activity) in a wild
   population of eastern rock sengis (Elephantulus myurus) from Limpopo,
   South Africa. Between March 2012 and March 2016, we recorded capture
   locations for 93 sengis and home range size for 22 sengis and evaluated
   the contributions of study year, sex, and season on these measures. Sex
   had no significant effect on home range size, but ranges were
   significantly greater during the breeding compared to the non-breeding
   season, consistent with the increased energetic demands during
   reproduction. We found corroborative support for the role of energetic
   demands on home range size fluctuations. The activity centers of
   female-female dyads were further apart than those of male-male or
   mixed-sex dyads, suggesting lower female-female tolerances in the study
   species. Our results offer evidence that intolerances may affect female
   spacing behavior and may have contributed to the evolution of monogamy
   in sengis.},

Title = {Use of cultivated foods and matrix habitat by Bale monkeys in forest
   fragments: Assessing local human attitudes and perceptions},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Number = {4, SI},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Primates inhabiting human-modified landscapes often exploit matrix
   habitat to supplement their diet with cultivated foods, at times
   resulting in economic losses and conflict with local people.
   Understanding human-nonhuman primate interactions and the attitudes and
   perceptions of local people towards crop feeding species are crucial to
   designing effective species-based management plans. Over a 12-month
   period, we used scan sampling to study the consumption of cultivated
   foods and matrix use patterns by two habituated groups of Bale monkeys
   (Chlorocebus djamdjamensis), Ethiopian-endemic bamboo specialists, in
   two forest fragments (Kokosa and Afursa) set amidst human settlements
   and farmland in the southern Ethiopian Highlands. Further, we conducted
   interviews with local people to document their attitudes and perceptions
   towards Bale monkeys at the two sites. We found that Bale monkeys at
   Kokosa, a more degraded habitat by most measures, consumed significantly
   more cultivated foods than their counterparts at Afursa. Moreover, Bale
   monkeys at Kokosa spent significantly more time in the matrix than in
   the forest habitat, while monkeys at Afursa spent significantly less
   time in the matrix than in the forest habitat. Not surprisingly, local
   people displayed a more negative attitude towards monkeys inhabiting
   Kokosa than those inhabiting Afursa. The differences in Bale monkey
   cultivated food consumption and matrix use patterns-as well as in local
   people's attitudes and perceptions towards Bale monkeys-between Kokosa
   and Afursa are probably associated with differences in habitat
   structure, degree of habitat alteration, and land-use practices between
   the sites. We conclude that to ensure long-term coexistence between Bale
   monkeys and local people in human-modified landscapes, it is vital to
   incorporate nearby matrix habitats into management plans and to work
   closely with local communities to develop effective nonlethal crop
   protection strategies, thereby reducing the likelihood of negative
   interactions between Bale monkeys and humans.},

Title = {Population genetic structure of the thick-tailed bushbaby (Otolemur

Abstract = {Greater bushbabies, strepsirrhine primates, that are distributed across
   central, eastern and southern Africa, with northern and eastern South
   Africa representing the species' most southerly distribution. Greater
   bushbabies are habitat specialists whose naturally fragmented habitats
   are getting even more fragmented due to anthropogenic activities.
   Currently, there is no population genetic data or study published on the
   species. The aim of our study was to investigate the genetic variation
   in a thick-tailed bushbaby, Otolemur crassicaudatus, population in the
   Soutpansberg mountain range, Limpopo Province, South Africa. Four
   mitochondrial regions, ranging from highly conserved to highly variable,
   were sequenced from 47 individuals. The sequences were aligned and
   genetic diversity, structure, as well as demographic analyses were
   performed. Low genetic diversity (pi = 0.0007-0.0038 in coding regions
   and pi = 0.0127 in non-coding region; Hd = 0.166-0.569 in coding regions
   and Hd = 0.584 in non-coding region) and sub-structuring (H = 2-3 in
   coding regions and H = 4 in non-coding region) was observed with two
   divergent haplogroups (haplotype pairwise distance = 3-5 in coding
   region and 6-10 in non-coding region) being identified. This suggests
   the population may have experienced fixation of mitochondrial haplotypes
   due to limited female immigration, which is consistent with philopatric
   species, that alternative haplotypes are not native to this population,
   and that there may be male mobility from adjacent populations. This
   study provides the first detailed insights into the mitochondrial
   genetic diversity of a continental African strepsirrhine primate and
   demonstrates the utility of mitochondrial DNA in intraspecific genetic
   population analyses of these primates.},

Abstract = {Social interactions of the nocturnal primates are not well studied. One
   of the species for which social behavior is scarcely known is the
   Philippine tarsier (Tarsius {[}= Carlito] syrichta). We observed a
   reproducing pair of captive individuals over two mating seasons for two
   consecutive years. The tarsiers spent approximately 4\% of their
   activity budget on social interactions; ca. 20\% of time in 0-1 m
   proximity to each other; and shared sleeping sites for half of the study
   time. The majority of the animals' social interactions were peaceful:
   affiliative and sexual (83\%), and the smallest component of the
   behavior was agonistic (17\%). We witnessed two copulation events (one
   per estrus day), each lasting ca. 5 min, and both occurring just after
   waking. We revealed temporal - nightly and hourly - fluctuations in the
   frequency of social interactions, in the distances the individuals spent
   from each other and in the number of vocalizations. The results present
   the first assessment of the social behavior of the Philippine tarsier,
   much needed to improve the captive breeding management for this highly
   sensitive species threatened with extinction.},

Title = {Keeping cool in the heat: Behavioral thermoregulation and body
   temperature patterns in wild vervet monkeys},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {171},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objectives Climate change is having a significant impact on biodiversity
   and increasing attention is therefore being devoted to identifying the
   behavioral strategies that a species uses to cope with climatic stress.
   We explore how wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) respond to
   heat stress, and how behavioral adaptations are used to regulate body
   temperature. Materials and methods We implanted wild vervet monkeys with
   temperature-sensitive data loggers and related the body temperature
   rhythms of these animals to their use of thermoregulatory behaviors.
   Results Environmental temperature had a positive effect on the mean,
   minima and maxima of daily body temperatures. Environmental temperature
   had a positive effect on the amount of time that vervet monkeys spent in
   the shade, and animals that spent more time in the shade had lower body
   temperature maxima. Drinking water did not have a proximate effect on
   body temperature, most likely a consequence of their regular access to
   drinking water. Body temperatures were observed to decrease after
   swimming events, but tended to return to pre-swim temperatures within 1
   hr, suggesting a limited thermal benefit of this behavior. Conclusions
   Our data support the view that vervet monkeys cope well in the heat, and
   use behavior as a means to aid thermoregulation. The ability of primates
   to be flexible in their use of thermoregulatory behaviors can contribute
   positively to their capacity to cope with environmental variability.
   However, given its broad effect on plant productivity and habitat loss,
   climate change is a major threat to species' biogeographical
   distribution and survival.},

Title = {Illuminating movement? Nocturnal activity patterns in chacma baboons},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {310},
Number = {4},
Pages = {287-297},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recent analyses have shown that typically diurnal primates may
   periodically exhibit some levels of activity at night. Despite this,
   there have been few studies that have explored whether diurnal primates
   living in temperate environments will extend their activity budgets to
   the nocturnal phase as a response to seasonal constraints. Using
   dual-axis accelerometers, we explored whether chacma baboons (Papio
   ursinus; N = 3) in the western Soutpansberg Mountains, South Africa,
   responded to seasonally fluctuating levels of day length, lunar
   illumination, wind speed, precipitation and temperature by heightening
   or lowering nocturnal activity levels. Our results showed that chacma
   baboons engaged in low levels of activity at night throughout the year.
   Although baboons had heighted nocturnal activity as a response to
   shorter days, moonlit nights and lower temperatures, these responses
   were most likely due to disturbed sleeping patterns rather than more
   active movement. Nocturnal activity significantly dropped in a female
   baboon throughout the course of her pregnancy and remained low after
   giving birth suggesting that females with infants must increase resting.
   Our results compliment previous analyses which suggest that although
   diurnal primates may periodically be active at night, there is limited
   evidence for strategic use of the nocturnal phase even in highly
   seasonal environments.},

Title = {Early anthropoid femora reveal divergent adaptive trajectories in
   catarrhine hind-limb evolution},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 8},
Abstract = {The divergence of crown catarrhines-i.e., the split of cercopithecoids
   (Old World monkeys) from hominoids (apes and humans)-is a poorly
   understood phase in our shared evolutionary history with other primates.
   The two groups differ in the anatomy of the hip joint, a pattern that
   has been linked to their locomotor strategies: relatively restricted
   motion in cercopithecoids vs. more eclectic movements in hominoids. Here
   we take advantage of the first well-preserved proximal femur of the
   early Oligocene stem catarrhine Aegyptopithecus to investigate the
   evolution of this anatomical region using 3D morphometric and
   phylogenetically-informed evolutionary analyses. Our analyses reveal
   that cercopithecoids and hominoids have undergone divergent evolutionary
   transformations of the proximal femur from a similar ancestral
   morphology that is not seen in any living anthropoid, but is preserved
   in Aegyptopithecus, stem platyrrhines, and stem cercopithecoids. These
   results highlight the relevance of fossil evidence for illuminating key
   adaptive shifts in primate evolution.},

Title = {Global phylogeography and ancient evolution of the widespread human gut

Journal = {NATURE MICROBIOLOGY},

Volume = {4},

Abstract = {Microbiomes are vast communities of microorganisms and viruses that
   populate all natural ecosystems. Viruses have been considered to be the
   most variable component of microbiomes, as supported by virome surveys
   and examples of high genomic mosaicism. However, recent evidence
   suggests that the human gut virome is remarkably stable compared with
   that of other environments. Here, we investigate the origin, evolution
   and epidemiology of crAssphage, a widespread human gut virus. Through a
   global collaboration, we obtained DNA sequences of crAssphage from more
   than one-third of the world's countries and showed that the
   phylogeography of crAssphage is locally clustered within countries,
   cities and individuals. We also found fully colinear crAssphage-like
   genomes in both Old-World and New-World primates, suggesting that the
   association of crAssphage with primates may be millions of years old.
   Finally, by exploiting a large cohort of more than 1,000 individuals, we
   tested whether crAssphage is associated with bacterial taxonomic groups
   of the gut microbiome, diverse human health parameters and a wide range
   of dietary factors. We identified strong correlations with different
   clades of bacteria that are related to Bacteroidetes and weak
   associations with several diet categories, but no significant
   association with health or disease. We conclude that crAssphage is a
   benign cosmopolitan virus that may have coevolved with the human lineage

Abstract = {Thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) are
   excellent models for studying acute brain ischemia because they show
   high resistance to reductions in blood flow and oxygen delivery without
   evidence of neurological damage. In this study, we analyzed the insulin
   signaling pathway and regulation of mitochondrial substrate oxidation in
   three regions of ground squirrel brain (forebrain, cerebellum, and
   brainstem), comparing summer, late torpor, and interbout arousal
   conditions. We found select decreases in phospho-Akt in the cerebellum
   during torpor compared with summer animals, as well as select increases
   in the forebrain during interbout arousal, suggesting that Akt may
   influence either metabolism or cytoprotective pathways. The
   phosphoprotein abundance of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta)
   showed the most consistent trend across all three brain regions, with
   peak increases observed during deep torpor, suggesting a crucial role
   for this protein during hibernation. Furthermore, all three regions of
   the brain showed increased phospho-protein abundance of pyruvate
   dehydrogenase at serine 232 during both deep torpor and interbout
   arousal, and serine 300 during interbout arousal only, whereas other
   phosphorylation sites showed a region-specific expression pattern.
   Information collected from these studies sheds light on the molecular
   controls governing insulin signaling and fuel utilization in the brain
   of hibernating ground squirrels.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To determine how critical data assets are conceptualized and managed in
   the public sector, we conducted a large-scale empirical study at 15
   government agencies. We use the Data Management Maturity (DMM) reference
   model framework to conduct a systematic multi-level analysis
   (inter-agency, intra-agency, and cross-case analysis). To aid the
   comparative assessment of multiple independent agencies, we propose and
   test the DMM Index. The study not only examines the maturity of data
   management practices in government agencies, but also provides guidance
   on how an enterprise-wide, systematic assessment may be conducted. The
   approach presented in the paper can be replicated at other large
   government entities and private conglomerates. Public and private sector
   agencies may apply the approach to develop custom roadmaps for data
   management improvements that align with the organization's business
   goals.},

Title = {Encephalopathy induced by Alzheimer brain inoculation in a non-human
   primate},
Journal = {ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 4},
Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is characterized by cognitive alterations, cerebral
   atrophy and neuropathological lesions including neuronal loss,
   accumulation of misfolded and aggregated beta-amyloid peptides (A beta)
   and tau proteins. Iatrogenic induction of A beta is suspected in
   patients exposed to pituitary-derived hormones, dural grafts, or
   surgical instruments, presumably contaminated with A beta. Induction of
   A beta and tau lesions has been demonstrated in transgenic mice after
   contamination with Alzheimer's disease brain homogenates, with very
   limited functional consequences. Unlike rodents, primates naturally
   express A beta or tau under normal conditions and attempts to transmit
   Alzheimer pathology to primates have been made for decades. However,
   none of earlier studies performed any detailed functional assessments.
   For the first time we demonstrate long term memory and learning
   impairments in a non-human primate (Microcebus murinus) following
   intracerebral injections with Alzheimer human brain extracts. Animals
   inoculated with Alzheimer brain homogenates displayed progressive
   cognitive impairments (clinical tests assessing cognitive and motor
   functions), modifications of neuronal activity (detected by
   electroencephalography), widespread and progressive cerebral atrophy (in
   vivo MRI assessing cerebral volume loss using automated voxel-based
   analysis), neuronal loss in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (post
   mortem stereology). They displayed parenchymal and vascular A beta
   depositions and tau lesions for some of them, in regions close to the
   inoculation sites. Although these lesions were sparse, they were never
   detected in control animals. Tau-positive animals had the lowest
   performances in a memory task and displayed the greatest neuronal loss.
   Our study is timely and important as it is the first one to highlight
   neuronal and clinical dysfunction following inoculation of Alzheimer's
   disease brain homogenates in a primate. Clinical signs in a chronic
   disease such as Alzheimer take a long time to be detectable.
   Documentation of clinical deterioration and/or dysfunction following
   intracerebral inoculations with Alzheimer human brain extracts could
   lead to important new insights about Alzheimer initiation processes.},

Title = {Vertical support use and primate origins},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 26},
Abstract = {Adaptive scenarios of crown primate origins remain contentious due to
   uncertain order of acquisition and functional significance of the
   Glade's diagnostic traits. A feature of the talus bone in the ankle,
   known as the posterior trochlear shelf (PTS), is well-regarded as a
   derived crown primate trait, but its adaptive significance has been
   obscured by poorly understood function. Here we propose a novel
   biomechanical function for the PTS and model the talus as a cam
   mechanism. By surveying a large sample of primates and their closest
   relatives, we demonstrate that the PTS is most strongly developed in
   extant taxa that habitually grasp vertical supports with strongly
   dorsiflexed feet. Tali of the earliest fossils likely to represent crown
   primates exhibit more strongly developed PTS cam mechanisms than extant
   primates. As a cam, the PTS may increase grasping efficiency in
   dorsiflexed foot postures by increasing the path length of the flexor
   fibularis tendon, and thus improve the muscle's ability to maintain
   flexed digits without increasing energetic demands. Comparisons are made
   to other passive digital flexion mechanisms suggested to exist in other
   vertebrates. These results provide robust anatomical evidence that the
   habitual vertical support use exerted a strong selective pressure during
   crown primate origins.},

Abstract = {Agricultural landscapes provide financial livelihoods for farming
   communities in rural areas. However, such agroenvironments can
   significantly impact the local floral biodiversity and introduce harmful
   invasive species to the ecosystem. Despite the prominence of plantations
   throughout the tropics, their effects on local flora are limited to only
   a few specific cash crops and geographical regions. Here, we compared
   the species richness and structural diversity of vegetation in natural
   forest fragments and three types of vanilla plantation within the Sava
   region of north-east Madagascar ranging from those within or adjacent to
   existing forests, to intensively cultivated plantations. We recorded
   data on plant species abundance, diameter at breast height and canopy
   cover within multiple sites of each habitat. We used abundance data to
   calculate species richness indices, and we compared these metrics
   between habitats. Forested habitats contained a significantly higher
   floral species richness, structural diversity and more endemic and
   regionally native species than nonforested, anthropogenic vanilla
   plantations. However, our results suggest that the high floral species
   richness and structural diversity of natural forests can be partially
   achieved in vanilla plantations, depending on the site's management
   regime; traditionally managed vanilla plantations located close to
   natural forests can support diverse floral communities. These
   encouraging findings for plant conservation and sustainable agroforestry
   in Madagascar suggest that that newly created vanilla plantations and
   already existing nonforested plantations should endeavour to follow the
   more traditional forested approach to enhance the future sustainability
   and promote floristic diversity.},

Abstract = {Previous behavioral reports of the African lorisid, Perodicticus potto,
   have speculated that these animals have an extraordinary grip strength.
   This ability is hypothesized to be facilitated by a range of anatomical
   features within the forelimb, ranging from the presence of a retia
   mirabilia in its wrist to the hyper-abduction of its pollex. Despite
   numerous behavioral reports, however, this claim of extraordinary grip
   strength has not been empirically substantiated. This study quantifies
   the physiological cross-sectional area of the digital flexor muscles
   within P. potto. These data are compared with a broad primate sample,
   including several similarly sized strepsirrhines. Contrary to
   expectation, we found that P. potto actually has relatively
   below-average digital flexor PCSA. However, we identified other
   myological characteristics in the upper limb of P. potto that were
   unexpected, including the largest brachioradialis muscle (an elbow
   flexor) among our primate sample, and - despite P. potto having only a
   vestigial second digit - an independent digital extensor indicis that is
   absent in almost a quarter of our primate sample.},

Abstract = {The human ilium is significantly shorter and broader than those of all
   other primates. In addition, it exhibits an anterior inferior iliac
   spine (AIIS) that emerges via a secondary center of ossification, which
   is unique to hominids (i.e., all taxa related to the human Glade
   following their phyletic separation from the African apes). Here, we
   track the ontogeny of human and other primate ossa coxae. The human
   pattern is unique, from anlage to adulthood, and fusion of its AIIS is
   the capstone event in a repositioning of the anterior gluteals that
   maximizes control of pelvic drop during upright walking. It is therefore
   a hominid synapomorphy that can be used to assess the presence and age
   of bipedal locomotion in extinct taxa.},

Abstract = {Companion-animal hoarding is a significant problem in the United States
   and internationally. Hoarding situations can incubate for years before a
   case is reported to law enforcement or animal control agencies.
   According to a survey by Gary Patronek, animal control agencies have
   estimated there are approximately 3000 reportable cases of animal
   hoarding annually in the United States. Animal hoarding cases vary in
   size from fewer than 20 animals to hundreds of animals. Every case of
   animal hoarding results in suboptimal animal welfare. Wake County, North
   Carolina, developed a proactive plan for addressing companion-animal
   hoarding that implemented a team approach to assist animals at risk,
   hold people accountable, address the mental health component of this
   problem, and create a more humane community. The plan involved animal
   control officers, crisis intervention counselors, law enforcement
   officers, veterinarians, veterinary technicians, and animal rescue
   partners. This intervention strategy was implemented in 2015, and cases
   were tracked to document animal outcomes. The conclusion of this
   experience is that a diverse team approach can best address the animal
   and human welfare challenges and the environmental concerns associated
   with animal hoarding.},

Abstract = {A novel implementation of an isolated gate driver for power switches is
   proposed in this study. The driver is bespoke designed for SiC power
   MOSFETs. The proposal achieves the main driver characteristics-isolation
   capability, gate switching command, and power transfer to the secondary
   side by using a unique magnetic transformer. The resulting simple
   circuitry enables the integration of the driver into the power cell,
   achieving theoretical higher power density values of the final system.
   The principle of operation of the driver is described in detail. The
   original pulsewidth modulation signal is modulated with a pure ac square
   waveform under a two-level modulation scheme, that guarantees no
   saturation of the magnetic core. The signal is then magnetically coupled
   to the secondary side, where it is rectified and reconstructed to
   effectively drive the target device. In addition, the steps needed to
   provide a suitable design taking into account the parameters of the
   target power switch are also detailed. The resulting driver is
   characterized and a prototype of the driver is built and tested. The
   main results of the driver performance on a SiC MOSFET-based prototype
   are presented. Based on the analysis of these results, this study
   experimentally demonstrates the feasibility of the proposal.},

Title = {Comparative chemical analysis of body odor in great apes},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {81},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Olfaction is important across the animal kingdom for transferring
   information on, for example, species, sex, group membership, or
   reproductive parameters. Its relevance has been established in primates
   including humans, yet research on great apes still is fragmentary.
   Observational evidence indicates that great apes use their sense of
   smell in various contexts, but the information content of their body
   odor has not been analyzed. Our aim was therefore to compare the
   chemical composition of body odor in great ape species, namely Sumatran
   orangutans (Pongo abelii (Lesson, 1827), one adult male, five adult
   females, four nonadults), Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla
   gorilla (Savage, 1847), one adult male, two adult females, one
   nonadult), common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes (Blumenbach, 1775), four
   adult males, nine adult females, four nonadults), and bonobos (Pan
   paniscus (Schwarz, 1929), two adult males, four adult females, two
   nonadults). We collected 195 samples (five per individual) of 39 captive
   individuals using cotton swabs and analyzed them using gas
   chromatography mass spectrometry. We compared the sample richness and
   intensity, similarity of chemical composition, and relative abundance of
   compounds. Results show that species, age, and potentially sex have an
   impact on the variance between odor profiles. Richness and intensity
   varied significantly between species (gorillas having the highest,
   bonobos the lowest richness and intensity), and with age (both
   increasing with age). Richness and intensity did not vary between sexes.
   Odor samples of the same species were more similar to each other than
   samples of different species. Among all compounds identified some were
   associated with age (N = 7), sex (N = 6), and species-related (N = 37)
   variance. Our study contributes to the basic understanding of olfactory
   communication in hominids by showing that the chemical composition of
   body odor varies across species and individuals, containing potentially
   important information for social communication.},

Abstract = {This paper is an introduction to a special issue of the Biological
   Journal of the Linnean Society (2019, volume 127: issue 3) focused on an
   interdisciplinary approach to the evolution of grasping and manipulation
   in tetrapods. Grasping is associated with pronounced morphological,
   dietary, social and locomotor differentiation, and this prompts several
   evolutionary questions, including the following. In primates, was the
   origin and evolution of grasping associated primarily with feeding or
   with locomotion and other social behaviours? Are some grasping and
   manipulative abilities unique to humans? What is the variability in
   grasping and manipulation among primates? What can we learn from other
   tetrapods? The special issue addresses some of these questions by
   exploring the ways in which the anatomy, functional morphology, ontogeny
   and biomechanics of tetrapods enable their hands to carry out diverse
   functions, such as locomotion and manipulation. We briefly review the
   possible origin and evolution of grasping and manipulative abilities in
   tetrapods and then introduce the ten other contributions to the special
   issue.},

Title = {Ownership of parrots in Madagascar: extent and conservation implications},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {582-588},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The trade of live parrots is a threat to wild populations but is
   understudied. Madagascar is home to three parrot species listed on CITES
   Appendix II: Coracopsis nigra, Coracopsis vasa and Agapornis canus.
   Prior to this study there were no data on the ownership of parrots in
   Madagascar. We therefore aimed to investigate the extent of the domestic
   pet trade in this group. Our objectives were to quantify the prevalence,
   spatial extent, and timing of ownership. We collected data in July and
   August 2016 in nine urban towns across Madagascar, using semi-structured
   household surveys (n = 440). We found that the ownership of pet parrots
   is widespread in time and space; 37\% (95\% CI 26-48\%) of interviewees
   had seen, and 8\% (95\% CI 3-13\%) had owned, a Coracopsis sp. Fewer
   interviewees (4.5\% of all interviewees) had seen A. canus in captivity,
   and only one individual reported having previously owned an A. canus. We
   estimate that 1,290 Coracopsis spp. individuals were held in captivity
   in the towns surveyed, in the 1.5 years prior to our interviews. It is
   likely that much of this ownership is illegal, although we did not
   examine this explicitly. Additional research is needed to determine
   whether current extraction rates are sustainable. This study adds to a
   growing body of evidence that the domestic regulation of the trade of
   wild species is not being addressed adequately in Madagascar.},

   Theoretical Model},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical model to describe the progression of
   leading (falling) lightnings in storms (stepped leaders). Stepped
   leaders move down from the thundercloud base to the encounter point with
   an upward streamer. First, the existing models, related to the advance
   of leading lightnings, are analyzed. Then, a novel theory is presented.
   The proposed model describes both the leader progression and speed. It
   aims at explaining the leader progression as a succession of several
   steps, or branches, that form the well-known tree-like shape. The speed
   of advance per step is described as a function of various parameters:
   the charge concentration surface diameter and the step length, among
   others. The derived formulas include two new parameter named (chi) and
   G. chi is the ratio between the guide beam length (L) and the diameter
   of the circle, inside the cloud, where the charges are concentrated (D).
   G relates density of charges, as explained herein.},

Title = {Morphometric signals of population decline in diademed sifakas occupying
   degraded rainforest habitat in Madagascar},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic habitat change can have varied impacts on primates,
   including both negative and positive outcomes. Even when behavioural
   shifts are seen, they may reflect decreased health, or simply
   behavioural flexibility; understanding this distinction is important for
   conservation efforts. This study examines habitat-related variation in
   adult and immature morphometrics among diademed sifakas (Propithecus
   diadema). We collected morphometric data from sifakas at Tsinjoarivo,
   Madagascar (19 years, 188 captures, 113 individuals). Captures spanned
   12 groups, five within continuous forest ({''}CONT{''}), and seven in
   degraded fragments ({''}FRAG{''}) where sifakas have lower nutritional
   intakes. Few consistent differences were found between CONT and FRAG
   groups. However, using home range quality as a covariate rather than a
   CONT/FRAG dichotomy revealed a threshold: the two FRAG groups in the
   lowest-quality habitat showed low adult mass and condition (wasting),
   and low immature mass and length (stunting). Though less-disturbed
   fragments apparently provide viable habitat, we suggest the sifakas in
   the most challenging habitats cannot evolve fast enough to keep up with
   such rapid habitat change. We suggest other long-lived organisms will
   show similar morphometric ``warning signs{''} (wasting in adults,
   stunting in immatures); selected morphometric variables can thus be
   useful at gauging vulnerability of populations in the face of
   anthropogenic change.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a decoupled model of a train including an on-board hybrid
   accumulation system is presented to be used in DC traction networks. The
   train and the accumulation system behavior are modeled separately, and
   the results are then combined in order to study the effect of the whole
   system on the traction electrical network. The model is designed
   specifically to be used with power flow solvers for planning purposes.
   The validation has been carried out comparing the results with other
   methods previously developed and also with experimental measurements. A
   detailed description of the power flow solver is beyond the scope of
   this work, but it must be remarked that the model must by used with a
   solver able to cope with the non-linear and non-smooth characteristics
   of the model. In this specific case, a modified current injection-based
   power flow solver has been used. The solver is able to incorporate also
   non-reversible substations, which are the most common devices used
   currently for feeding DC systems. The effect of the on-board
   accumulation systems on the network efficiency will be analyzed using
   different real scenarios.},

Title = {Optimization of a Series Converter for Low-Frequency Ripple Cancellation
   of an LED Driver},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper, the optimization of the power and control stages of a
   previously proposed topology for an off-line LED electronic driver is
   presented. The full system avoids the use of electrolytic capacitors at
   the DC link, therefore increasing the lifespan and reliability of the
   driver. As a consequence of having a relatively small capacitance, the
   DC link operates with a large Low-Frequency (LF) voltage ripple. This
   work presents a design optimization for the power and control stages of
   a current-fed bidirectional buck converter, operating as the LED current
   control stage. As this block processes only the AC power arising from
   the LF voltage ripple, it can increase the system efficiency against the
   typical two-stage solution. In the original proposal, the main drawback
   was the high inductor losses due to the resulting large inductor
   currents and large inductance value. The proposed optimization ensures
   an enhanced design of the inductor while keeping a constant current
   through the LEDs. A new optimization methodology is proposed and the
   theoretical results have been validated in a built prototype for a 40 W
   LED lamp.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present the design of a small, wideband antenna with
   an embedded non-Foster circuit. The design procedure is based on
   modeling the antenna in the presence of the EM model of the negative
   impedance converter (NIC) and trying to optimize the components and
   location of this active circuit inside the antenna. The EM modeling of
   the circuit provides the possibility to identify the key parameters that
   mostly affect the performance of the antenna in terms of bandwidth and
   efficiency. These parameters are then optimized accordingly. This
   procedure is applied on a monopole antenna, which has its natural
   resonance at 2.2 GHz. With an embedded non-Foster circuit, the antenna
   is miniaturized to cover wideband frequencies around 900 MHz. Two
   examples are considered for different NIC topologies, after optimizing
   the components of the NIC, the best performance was given by the second
   antenna, which exhibits an impedance bandwidth of 50\% (0.84-1.45 GHz)
   and total efficiency of 25\%. The measurement results of both antennas
   are in good agreement with simulations showing a significant enhancement
   with respect to the passive antenna.},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Madagascar poses a significant challenge for understanding how people
   colonized islands. While its inhabitants also share an African ancestry,
   language, genetics, and culture all point to the arrival on the island
   of Austronesian-speaking settlers from the far side of the Indian Ocean.
   Recent decades have seen increasing acceptance of a late
   first-millennium BC date for Madagascar's initial settlement, based
   principally on arguments relating to the purported antiquity and
   presence of cut-marked animal bones and the pollen of humanly introduced
   Cannabis plants. More recently, these claims have been pushed much
   further back in time by the discovery of stone tools at Lakaton'i Anja
   and cut-marked bones at Christmas River and Lamboharana. Such arguments
   must be based on firm foundations if they are to be accepted. This paper
   evaluates them against criteria developed for assessing the timing and
   credibility of claims of pre-Clovis settlement in the Americas and early
   Polynesian presence in Remote Oceania. It concludes that they do not
   meet them and that for now there is thus no convincing evidence that
   Madagascar was settled before the mid-first millennium AD. Colonization
   around that time fits much better with broader patterns of contact,
   trade, and settlement in the wider Indian Ocean world, including other
   islands off Africa's eastern coast.},

   to attenuate 5-LO pathway activity and leukotriene production in human

   inflammatory diseases remains to be established. We here describe a
   novel series of FLAP inhibitors identified from a screen of 10k
   compounds and the medicinal chemistry strategies undertaken to progress
   this series. Compound 4i showed good overall properties and a pIC(50)
   hWB(free) of 8.1 and an lipophilic ligand efficiency of 5.2. Target
   engagement for 4i was established in dogs using ex vivo measurement of
   leukotriene B-4 (LTB4) levels in blood with good correlation to in vitro
   potency. A predicted human dose of 280 mg b.i.d. suggests a wide margin
   to any identified in vitro off-target effects and sufficient exposure to
   achieve an 80\% reduction of LTB4 levels in humans. Compound 4i is
   progressed to preclinical in vivo safety studies.},

Abstract = {5-Lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) inhibitors attenuate

   navigation away from Ames mutagenic amine fragments while balancing

Title = {The mechanical origins of arm-swinging},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {61-71},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Arm-swinging is a locomotor mode observed only in primates, in which the
   hindlimbs no longer have a weight bearing function and the forelimbs
   must propel the body forward and support the entirety of the animal's
   mass. It has been suggested that the evolution of arm-swinging was
   preceded by a shift to inverted quadrupedal walking for purposes of
   feeding and balance, yet little is known about the mechanics of limb use
   during inverted quadrupedal walking. In this study, we test whether the
   mechanics of inverted quadrupedal walking make sense as precursors to
   arm-swinging and whether there are fundamental differences in inverted
   quadrupedal walking in primates compared to non-primate mammals that
   would explain the evolution of arm-swinging in primates only. Based on
   kinetic limb-loading data collected during inverted quadrupedal walking
   in primates (seven species) and non-primate mammals (three species), we
   observe that in primates the forelimb serves as the primary propulsive
   and weight bearing limb. Additionally, heavier individuals tend to
   support a greater distribution of body weight on their forelimbs than
   lighter ones. These kinetic patterns are not observed in non-primate
   mammals. Based on these findings, we propose that the ability to adopt
   arm-swinging is fairly simple for relatively large-bodied primates and
   merely requires the animal to release its grasping foot from the
   substrate. This study fills an important gap concerning the origins of
   arm-swinging and illuminates previously unknown patterns of primate
   locomotor evolution. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Cestode infections in non-human primates suggest the existence of
   zoonotic cycles in the area surrounding the Strasbourg primatology
   center},
Journal = {PARASITE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Background: Several cases of infections due to Echinococcus
   multilocularis, Taenia martis and Taenia crassiceps were recently
   described in various species of captive non-human primates (NHPs)
   harbored in the Strasbourg Primate Center (SPC). Furthermore, one of the
   first cases of human cysticercosis due to T. martis was described in the
   Strasbourg region. These data suggest the existence of zoonotic cycles
   of tapeworm infections in the direct environment of the SPC. The aim of
   our study was to assess the prevalence of larval cestode infections
   among intermediate and definitive hosts in the close neighborhood of the
   center. We analyzed carnivore mammal fecal samples as well as rodent
   carcasses, collected inside or near the SPC, using PCR. Furthermore, we
   performed serology for Echinococcus spp. and Taenia spp. on NHP sera.
   Results: We found that 14.5\% (95\% CI {[}8.6; 20.4]) of 138 carnivore
   feces were positive for E. multilocularis-DNA, as well as 25\% (95\% CI
   {[}5.5; 57.2]) of 12 rodent carcasses, and 5.1\% (95\% CI {[}1.4; 8.7])
   for T. martis or T. crassiceps. Of all NHPs tested, 10.1\% (95\% CI
   {[}3.8; 16.4]) were seropositive for Echinococcus spp. and 8.2\% (95\%
   CI {[}1.3; 15.1]) for Taenia spp. Conclusions: Our data support the
   existence of zoonotic cycles of larval cestode infections in the direct
   environment of the primatology center affecting NHPs harbored in the
   SPC, potentially threatening the human population living in this area.
   Since this zoonotic risk is borne by local wildlife, and given the
   severity of these infections, it seems necessary to put in place
   measures to protect captive NHPs, and further studies to better assess
   the risk to human populations.},

Abstract = {The early Paleogene is critical for understanding global biodiversity
   patterns in modern ecosystems. During this interval, Southern Hemisphere
   continents were largely characterized by isolation and faunal endemism
   following the breakup of Gondwana. Africa has been proposed as an
   important source area for the origin of several marine vertebrate groups
   but its Paleogene record is poorly sampled, especially from sub-Saharan
   Africa. To document the early Paleogene marine ecosystems of Central
   Africa, we revised the stratigraphic context of sedimentary deposits
   from three fossil-rich vertebrate localities: the Landana section in the
   Cabinda exclave (Angola), and the Manzadi and Bololo localities in
   western Democratic Republic of Congo. We provide more refined age
   constraints for these three localities based on invertebrate and
   vertebrate faunas, foraminiferal and dinoflagellate cyst assemblages,
   and carbon isotope records. We find an almost complete absence of
   Danian-aged rocks in the Landana section, contrary to prevailing
   interpretations over the last half a century (only the layer 1, at the
   base of the section, seems to be Danian). Refining the age of these
   Paleocene layers is crucial for analyzing fish evolution in a global
   framework, with implications for the early appearance of Scombridae
   (tunas and mackerels) and Tetraodontiformes (puffer fishes). The
   combination of vertebrate fossil records from Manzadi and Landana
   sections suggests important environmental changes around the K/Pg
   transition characterized by an important modification of the
   ichthyofauna. A small faunal shift may have occurred during the
   Selandian. More dramatic is the distinct decrease in overall richness
   that lasts from the Selandian to the Ypresian. The Lutetian of West
   Central Africa is characterized by the first appearance of numerous
   cartilaginous and bony fishes. Our analysis of the ichthyofauna moreover
   indicates two periods of faunal exchanges: one during the Paleocene,
   where Central Africa appears to have been a source for the European
   marine fauna, and another during the Eocene when Europe was the source
   of the Central Africa fauna. These data indicate that Central Africa has
   had connections with the Tethyian realm. (C) 2018, China University of

Abstract = {Kamoyapithecus hamiltoni is a potential early hominoid species described
   from fragmentary dentognathic specimens from the Oligocene site of
   Losodok (Turkana Basin, northwestern Kenya). Other catarrhine dental
   materials have been recovered at Losodok, but were not initially
   included in the Kamoyapithecus hypodigm. Here we present descriptions of
   the unpublished canine and incisor specimens from Losodok, and revisit
   the published specimens in light of recent changes in understanding of
   hominoid anterior dental evolution. The new fossils include a canine
   (KNM-LS 18354) that is morphologically compatible with being a female of
   Kamoyapithecus (KNM-LS 8). Randomization analyses of both Gorilla
   gorilla and middle Miocene Griphopithecus alpani demonstrate that the
   size difference between KNM-LS 8 and KNM-LS 18354 is also compatible
   with their being male and female canines of the same species.
   Significantly, a canine tip (KNM-LS 18352) attributed to Kamoyapithecus
   documents the distinctive burin tip morphology now recognized as
   characterizing Proconsul sensu stricto, which may indicate a close
   relationship between Kamoyapithecus and Proconsul. We also re-examined
   the enigmatic KNM-LS 1, a smaller lower canine assumed to derive from
   Losodok but for which historical provenience data are completely
   lacking. Elemental data derived from portable X-ray fluorescence
   spectroscopy show that KNM-LS 1 is almost certainly from Losodok rather
   than from nearby Miocene sites (i.e., Moruorot, Esha, Kalodirr). KNM-LS
   1 displays a nyanzapithecine-like morphology and is shown by
   randomization analyses to be too small to be associated with the
   Kamoyapithecus canines. This demonstrates that there is a second
   hominoid taxon present at Losodok that records one of the earliest
   occurrences of the Nyanzapithecinae. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This paper deals with the ac and dc dynamic voltage control in a hybrid
   dc/ac microgrid (MG) with central and distributed battery energy storage
   systems (BESSs), applying a power sharing mechanism between the
   different devices in the MG. The MG is composed by a multiport
   transformation center and two fixed frequency three phase ac nanogrids
   (NGs) coupled to a dc bus through three-phase power electronic
   converters. The system pursues to minimize the dependence on the utility
   grid and the stress in the MGs central BESS, while increasing the power
   handling capability and the overall system stability during islanding
   condition. In order to approach the proposed aim, two main concerns are
   studied in this paper: An adaptive power sharing mechanism between the
   dc bus and the ac NGs for dc voltage control, and the design and
   implementation of an ac dynamic local voltage compensator based on
   distributed energy storage system. The proposed techniques are validated
   through simulations and experimental results.},

Abstract = {Terrestrial mammals have evolved various foot postures: flatfooted
   (plantigrady), tiptoed (digitigrady), and hooved (unguligrady) postures.
   Although the importance of foot posture on ecology and body size of
   mammalian species has been widely recognized, its evolutionary
   trajectory and influence on body size evolution across mammalian
   phylogeny remain untested. Taking a Bayesian phylogenetic approach
   combined with a comprehensive dataset of foot postures in 880 extant
   mammalian species, we investigated the evolutionary history of foot
   postures and rates of body size evolution, within the same posture and
   at transitions between postures. Our results show that the common
   ancestor of mammals was plantigrade, and transitions predominantly
   occurred only between plantigrady and digitigrady and between
   digitigrady and unguligrady. At the transitions between plantigrady and
   digitigrady and between digitigrady and unguligrady, rates of body size
   evolution are significantly elevated leading to the larger body masses
   of digitigrade species (similar to 1 kg) and unguligrade species
   (similar to 78 kg) compared with their respective ancestral postures
   {[}plantigrady (similar to 0.75 kg) and digitigrady]. Our results
   demonstrate the importance of foot postures on mammalian body size
   evolution and have implications for mammalian body size increase through
   time. In addition, we highlight a way forward for future studies that
   seek to integrate morphofunctional and macroevolutionary approaches.},

Title = {Key periods of cognitive decline in a nonhuman primate model of
   cognitive aging, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)},
Journal = {NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {1-14},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {It is well established that human life expectancy increases considerably
   with an ever-growing number of people suffering from age-related
   cognitive decline and degenerative brain diseases. This necessitates the
   development of animal models to counteract or stop the progression of
   the decline early enough. Presently, primate models are few, and many
   studies argue for the marmoset as an interesting primate model
   presenting a short life span and being easily available in research
   laboratories. In this article, we propose the marmoset as a valid model
   for cognitive decline. Using a computer touch screen, we trained 35
   marmosets from 2 to 14 years of age to perform reversal learning and
   delayed-matching-to-position tasks. We found typical age-related
   cognitive deficits related to executive functions and spatial working
   memory. Applying a recursive algorithm, we detected 2 critical periods
   from which deficits appear. Mainly, response strategy deficits appear
   from age 4, whereas impairments in inhibitory control appear from age
   7-8. Furthermore, the presence of outliers, sometimes at an early age,
   suggests pathological cognitive deficits that would require imaging
   exploration in parallel to behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Reverse Dissection and DiceCT Reveal Otherwise Hidden Data in the
   Evolution of the Primate Face},
Journal = {JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS},
Year = {2019},
Number = {143},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Facial expressions, or facial displays, of social or emotional intent
   are produced by many mammalian taxa as a means of visually communicating
   with conspecifics at a close range. These displays are achieved by
   contraction of the mimetic muscles, which are skeletal muscle attached
   to the dermis of the face. Reverse dissection, removing the full facial
   mask from the skull and approaching mimetic muscles in reverse, is an
   effective but destructive way of revealing the morphology of mimetic
   muscles but it is destructive. DiceCT is a novel mechanism for
   visualizing skeletal muscles, including mimetic muscles, and isolating
   individual muscle fascicles for quantitative measurement. Additionally,
   DiceCT provides a non-destructive mechanism for visualizing muscles. The
   combined techniques of reverse dissection and DiceCT can be used to

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has been scaling up over the last few years in
   multiple applications and due to the need for geolocation and tracking
   capabilities, the usage of traditional Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)
   arises. In this paper, a novel methodology for localizing using TDoA is
   presented, after the detailed and complete description of the TDoA has
   been provided. This proposed method depends on the hyperbolic functions
   to localize the node on a hyperbola, rather than locating it in a free
   position in the space potentially suffering from the influence of the
   timestamp imperfections. Thus, the proposed approach is finding this
   location on a hyperbola at a point which has the minimum Euclidean
   distance to all the other hyperbolas. A comparison is performed
   investigating the attainable accuracies for localizing based on this
   parametric TDoA and the classical TDoA method, on a well-defined
   simulation environment. The simulator is based on a Poisson distribution
   approach for defining the gateways and the node topology, as well as a
   noise model for emulating the oscillator drift at the gateways. In the
   given results, the feasibility of the proposed technique is asserted by
   a drastic improvement over a wide range of drift variances and the
   number of gateways. This manifests the robustness of the contributed
   method to the outlier timestamps and its optimum rendering, especially
   when the number of gateways is expected to be increased in the future.},

Abstract = {Alveolar echinococcosis is caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm
   Echinococcus multilocularis and is considered one of the most pathogenic
   helminthic zoonoses. In central Europe, various rodents such as voles
   and muskrats act as intermediate hosts whereas humans act as aberrant
   intermediate hosts. We report the case of a naturally acquired alveolar
   echinococcosis in May 2018 that was diagnosed in a female Japanese
   macaque (Macaca fuscata) from a small zoo in the Tyrolean mountains at
   an altitude of 1100 metres above sea level. The 21-year-old female
   monkey started showing clinical signs such as a slowly progressing
   enlargement of the belly two years before death. Pathological findings
   focused on the liver, which was severely enlarged and showed two
   tumour-like tissue masses with coalescing hydatid cysts of 1 cm in
   diameter. The tumour-like enlargements were connected by anatomically
   unchanged liver tissue. The cutting surface of the altered tissue was
   homogenous, yellowish and firm. Histology revealed a severe
   granulomatous hepatitis with the presence of cysts including
   protoscolices. Larval infection with Echinococcus multilocularis was
   confirmed by histopathology and PCR. Echinococcus multilocularis is
   common in foxes in the Tyrolean mountains and recent work has revealed a
   prevalence of about 33 \% in the fox population. The Japanese monkey was
   kept in a fenced enclosure for several years and was suspected to have
   contracted the infection by contact with fox faeces (e. g. via feed or
   zookeepers). This is the first report of alveolar echinococcosis in a
   captive monkey in Austria.},

Abstract = {This paper studies two issues related with the use of distributed
   control for modular power converters based on the use of single-phase
   power units, namely intelligent Power Electronics Building Block (iPEBB)
   for power conversion in hybrid DC/AC microgrids. Some issues related to
   the distributed control are studied in this paper. Homopolar injection
   for PWM generation becomes more difficult, since each distributed
   controller calculates (and knows) only its control action. A possible
   solution is provided, based on the calculation of this homopolar
   injection by the central controller at 1 kHz. Synchronization with the
   grid becomes more difficult too, because each controller acts
   independently, without communication with the other ones (only with the
   central controller). Two alternatives are studied for this
   synchronization angle calculation: calculation in the central controller
   at central control frequency (1 kHz) or in each module at distributed
   control frequency (10 kHz).},

Abstract = {Hemosiderosis is an iron accumulation syndrome that can advance to
   hemochromatosis, which is the accumulation associated with disorders in
   organ function. Although howler monkeys have a specific iron metabolism
   related to their fur colour, iron accumulation in this specie has never
   been investigated. Hemochromatosis has been reported in other non-human
   primates. The main goal of the present study is to investigate post
   mortem iron accumulation on 105 livers of Allouata clamitans, from the
   biological material collection of the Centro de Pesquisas Biologicas de
   Indaial. This paper compares post mortem iron accumulation in the liver
   of free-ranging and captive Howler monkeys through Prussian Blue
   staining. For microscopic study, Hematoxilin-eosin stain exposed the
   cellular morphology and Prusian blue stain quantified the amount of iron
   accumulation. Chi-square test of independence and Prevalence Test were
   used for statistical evaluation. From 105 animals, 60 (57\%) were
   negative for iron (by Prussian blue staining) and 45 (42\%) were
   positive. There was no significant association between hepatic
   hemosiderosis and habitat, gender, or age. This is the first study
   addressing hepatic hemosiderosis in howler monkeys. Iron accumulation
   was present, however, liver damage (hemochromatosis) was not detected.},

Title = {Systematic and locomotor diversification of the Adapis group (Primates,
   Adapiformes) in the late Eocene of the Quercy (Southwest France),
   revealed by humeral remains},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {126},
Pages = {71-90},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Twenty humeral specimens from the old and new Quercy collections
   attributed to the fossil primates Adapis and Palaeolemur are described
   and analysed together. We provide a qualitative and quantitative
   analysis of the different humeri, revealing that high variability is
   present within the ``Adapis group{''} sample. Six different morphotypes
   are identified, confirming that what has often been called ``Adapis
   parisiensis{''} is a mix of different species that present different
   locomotor adaptations. Such a relatively high level of locomotor
   diversity is unique in the Paleogene primate fossil record.
   The humeral proportions of Adapis overlap with different groups of
   extant strepsirrhines and platyrrhines depending on the specimen, so the
   popular view of Adapis as a loris-like slow climbing primate does not
   apply to the whole sample presented here. Moreover, different humeral
   features traditionally associated with ``Adapis parisiensis{''}, such as
   the absence of a zona conoidea and a reduced brachioradialis flange, are
   variable depending on the sample studied. In addition, results of our
   analyses show that adapine and omomyid humeral morphology overlap
   extensively, leading us to question the accuracy of taxonomic
   attributions based on morphology of isolated humeri at localities where
   omomyids and adapines of similar size coexist.
   Finally, assuming our different morphotypes represent different species
   within two genera, we propose a phylogenetic hypothesis relating these
   morphotypes, which inhabited a small geographic area. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {Simulation is a valuable way to develop efficient design of the
   infrastructure and operations of electrical railway systems.
   Nevertheless, the size of such systems and the complexity of the power
   flows lead to complex models that require simplifications. A specific
   scenario has been identified as particularly difficult to study with
   most of the existing simulation tools. This scenario consists in a line
   with low energy recovery capacity in which all the substations are
   blocked. In such case, the railway system is disconnected from the AC
   grid and becomes an islanded system in which the braking trains, and
   eventually energy storage subsystems, supply other trains in traction
   mode. This paper aims to compare different modelling approaches to
   simulate DC railway systems in this specific scenario. The results
   highlight that conventionnal approach is not able to deal with this
   scenario. Another approach, based on a dynamic model from previous
   research works, is well able to estimate the system behavior with this
   scenario, but it leads to long computational time. Finally, an
   intermediary approach is proposed to simplify the model in such scenario
   and potentially reduce the computation time.},

Abstract = {Objectives Geophagy, the intentional consumption of earth, is widely
   practiced among humans and other mammals, but its causes are not well
   understood. Given the growing number of reports of geophagy among
   nonhuman primates (NHP), we sought to (1) advance and codify our
   understanding of the patterns and functional and evolutionary
   significance of geophagy among NHP and (2) provide a research agenda for
   a more unified approach to its study. Methods We systematically reviewed
   all available literature on NHP geophagy, extracted available data on
   taxa, geography, climate, diet, sex, age-class, reproductive status, and
   the characteristics of the earth. We used these data to evaluate three
   major hypotheses about geophagy, that it is protective, provides mineral
   supplementation, and is nonadaptive. Results We identified 287 accounts
   of geophagy among 136 species, adding 79 new primate species to the list
   of those considered in prior reviews. Nineteen percent of species were
   in the suborder Strepsirrhini, while 81\% were in the suborder
   Haplorrhini. There were reports of geophagy from 9 of the 17 families
   and 39 of the 76 genera currently recognized by the International Union
   for Conservation of Nature. Discussion The limited evidence suggests
   that geophagy is adaptive, and provides protection and mineral
   supplementation. We specify the behavioral, dietary, and soil data
   required to more rigorously investigate these hypotheses across
   representative species of all taxonomic groups, geographical regions,
   and dietary classification. Given the plausibility of geophagy for
   maintaining the health of both wild and captive populations, we urge
   further study and conservation of geophagy sites.},

Title = {Clarifying and expanding the social complexity hypothesis for
   communicative complexity},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {73},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Variation in communicative complexity has been conceptually and
   empirically attributed to social complexity, with animals living in more
   complex social environments exhibiting more signals and/or more complex
   signals than animals living in simpler social environments. As
   compelling as studies highlighting a link between social and
   communicative variables are, this hypothesis remains challenged by
   operational problems, contrasting results, and several weaknesses of the
   associated tests. Specifically, how to best operationalize social and
   communicative complexity remains debated; alternative hypotheses, such
   as the role of a species' ecology, morphology, or phylogenetic history,
   have been neglected; and the actual ways in which variation in signaling
   is directly affected by social factors remain largely unexplored. In
   this review, we address these three issues and propose an extension of
   the social complexity hypothesis for communicative complexity that
   resolves and acknowledges the above factors. We specifically argue for
   integrating the inherently multimodal nature of communication into a
   more comprehensive framework and for acknowledging the social context of
   derived signals and the potential of audience effects. By doing so, we
   believe it will be possible to generate more accurate predictions about
   which specific social parameters may be responsible for selection on new
   or more complex signals, as well as to uncover potential adaptive
   functions that are not necessarily apparent from studying communication
   in only one modality.Significance statementAnimals exhibit an
   astonishing diversity of communicative systems, with important variation
   in both the nature and the number of signals they produce. The roles of
   phylogenetic history, genetic drift, environmental factors, and sexual
   selection in shaping interspecific variation in communicative systems
   have long been acknowledged, whereas social complexity has only more
   recently emerged as a potential fundamental factor determining signal
   diversification. While a number of comparative studies support the key
   prediction of this hypothesis, i.e., that individuals living in more
   complex social environments exhibit more signals and/or more complex
   signals, we discuss several gaps in the current state of the art
   concerning this hypothesis and point out what we believe are neglected
   perspectives. By emphasizing the importance of the multimodal nature of
   communicative systems and the social context in which signals are
   exchanged, we hope to stimulate the development of new tests and
   specific questions based on this expanded framework.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a fusion method to estimate the low frequency
   impedance of Lithium-Ion batteries by using excitation signals. The
   proposed excitation is delivered by the converter used for the interface
   of the battery. The fusion method is conducted in two steps. Firstly,
   the impedance is estimated by using a frequency method known as vector
   fitting. Despite its high accuracy, it has a moderate computational
   burden that makes it difficult to use in real-time application running
   on the embedded systems often used for battery and converter control.
   For that reason, in a second stage, recursive least squares algorithm
   will be used for the parameter estimation in real-time. The discussion
   includes not only the methods description and testing, but also the
   effects of the data used for the estimation (terminal current and
   voltage) as well as the discretization method used for the digital
   implementation. The proposal is validated by simulation and with
   preliminary experimental results.},

Abstract = {Describing primate biodiversity is one of the main goals in primatology.
   Species are the fundamental unit of study in phylogeny, behaviour,
   ecology and conservation. Identifying species boundaries is particularly
   challenging for nocturnal taxa where only subtle morphological variation
   is present. Traditionally, vocal signals have been used to identify
   species within nocturnal primates: species-specific signals often play a
   critical role in mate recognition, and they can restrict gene flow with
   other species. However, little research has been conducted to test
   whether different acoustic forms also represent genetically distinct
   species. Here, we investigate species boundaries between two putative
   highly cryptic species of Eastern dwarf galagos (Paragalago cocosand P.
   zanzibaricus). We combined vocal and genetic data: molecular data
   included the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (1,140 bp) for 50
   samples across 11 localities in Kenya and Tanzania, while vocal data
   comprised 221 vocalisations recorded across 8 localities. Acoustic
   analyses showed a high level of correct assignation to the putative
   species (approx. 90\%), while genetic analyses identified two separate
   clades at the mitochondrial level. We conclude that P. cocos and P.
   zanzibaricus represent two valid cryptic species that probably underwent
   speciation in the Late Pliocene while fragmented in isolated populations
   in the eastern forests. (c) 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Title = {A large hyaenodont from the Lutetian of Switzerland expands the body

Abstract = {We here present a new hyaenodont genus and species from the Lutetian
   locality of Egerkingen. (Switzerland; MP13?): Cartierodon egerkingensis
   gen. et sp. nov. The new taxon is represented by numerous dental
   elements, mostly isolated teeth. The molars show typical features of a
   hypercarnivorous predator such as the strong reduction of the crushing
   (talonid/protocone) and puncturing (metaconid) structures. The
   calculation of several dental indices indicates that this hyaenodont may
   have been a bone-cracking predator. The new taxon differs from all the
   hyaenodonts previously known in Europe during the Ypresian and Lutetian
   by its larger size, with an estimated mass of almost 29 kg (the size of
   the extant African wild dog, Lycaon pictus). Other hyaenodonts known for
   this period do not exceed 20 kg. Previous authors proposed the
   hypothesis of an ecological limitation of the body mass, but the
   description of Cartierodon egerkingensis indicates instead that the
   European hyaenodonts continuously increased in size throughout the
   Eocene. We also performed a phylogenetic analysis in order to test the
   relationships of this new taxon: the new hyaenodont appears to be
   closely related to the Lutetian hyaenodont Prodissopsalis eocaenicus.},

Abstract = {Darting, a common method of capturing wild primates, poses risks to the
   individuals that must be appropriately minimized. A recent article in
   the International Journal of Primatology by Cunningham et al.
   (International Journal of Primatology, 36(5), 894-915, 2015) presented a
   literature review of the reporting of darting procedures in primatology
   and anonymously surveyed primatologists on darting methods and their
   effects, to report general trends in the field. We quantitatively
   reexamined 29 articles described by the authors as having information on
   fatalities and/or injuries. We think that the various body masses of
   primates (1kg-150 kg), along with their locations and habitat types, and
   the degree of experience of the darting team, should be considered when
   estimating mortality and injury rates, and thus preclude the computation
   of an average mortality value across taxa. Nevertheless, we computed an
   average (mean) for comparison with the previous analyses. Our mean
   estimated mortality rate was 2.5\% and the mean estimated injury risk
   was 1.5\% (N=21 articles). Thus, our estimated mortality rate is smaller
   than the combined mortality and injury rate of 5\% reported by
   Cunningham et al. (International Journal of Primatology, 36(5), 894-915,
   2015) and smaller than the mortality rates of medium-sized terrestrial
   mammals they used for comparison. Our study strongly suggests the
   critical need for more data to be analyzed in a standardized fashion.},

Abstract = {Mitochondria are not just the powerhouses of the cell; these `end of
   function' organelles are crucial components of cellular physiology and
   influence many central metabolic and signaling pathways that support
   complex multicellular life. Not surprisingly, these organelles play
   vital roles in adaptations for extreme survival strategies including
   hibernation and freeze tolerance, both of which are united by
   requirements for a strong reduction and reprioritization of metabolic
   processes. To facilitate metabolic rate depression, adaptations of all
   aspects of mitochondrial function are required, including; energetics,
   physiology, abundance, gene regulation, and enzymatic controls. This
   review discusses these factors with a focus on the stress-specific
   nature of mitochondrial genes and transcriptional regulators, and
   processes including apoptosis and chaperone protein responses. We also
   analyze the regulation of glutamate dehydrogenase and pyruvate
   dehydrogenase, central mitochondrial enzymes involved in coordinating
   the shifts in metabolic fuel use associated with extreme survival
   strategies. Finally, an emphasis is given to the novel mitochondrial
   research areas of microRNAs, peptides, epigenetics, and gaseous
   mediators and their potential roles in facilitating hypometabolism. (c)

Title = {Microbial nitrogen limitation in the mammalian large intestine},
Journal = {NATURE MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {3},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1441-1450},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Resource limitation is a fundamental factor governing the composition
   and function of ecological communities. However, the role of resource
   supply in structuring the intestinal microbiome has not been established
   and represents a challenge for mammals that rely on microbial symbionts
   for digestion: too little supply might starve the microbiome while too
   much might starve the host. We present evidence that microbiota occupy a
   habitat that is limited in total nitrogen supply within the large
   intestines of 30 mammal species. Lowering dietary protein levels in mice
   reduced their faecal concentrations of bacteria. A gradient of
   stoichiometry along the length of the gut was consistent with the
   hypothesis that intestinal nitrogen limitation results from host
   absorption of dietary nutrients. Nitrogen availability is also likely to
   be shaped by host-microbe interactions: levels of host-secreted nitrogen
   were altered in germ-free mice and when bacterial loads were reduced via
   experimental antibiotic treatment. Single-cell spectrometry revealed
   that members of the phylum Bacteroidetes consumed nitrogen in the large
   intestine more readily than other commensal taxa did. Our findings
   support a model where nitrogen limitation arises from preferential host
   use of dietary nutrients. We speculate that this resource limitation
   could enable hosts to regulate microbial communities in the large
   intestine. Commensal microbiota may have adapted to nitrogen-limited
   settings, suggesting one reason why excess dietary protein has been
   associated with degraded gut-microbial ecosystems.},

Title = {Primate tails: Ancestral state reconstruction and determinants of
   interspecific variation in primate tail length},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {167},
Number = {4},
Pages = {750-759},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective Living primates vary considerably in tail length-body size
   relation, ranging from tailless species to those where the tail is more
   than twice as long as the body. Because the general pattern and
   determinants of tail evolution remain incompletely known, we
   reconstructed evolutionary changes in relative tail length across all
   primates and sought to explain interspecific variation in this trait.
   Methods Results We combined data on tail length, head-body length,
   intermembral index (IMI), habitat use, locomotion type, and range
   latitude for 340 species from published sources. We reconstructed the
   evolution of relative tail length to identify all independent cases of
   regime shifts on a primate phylogeny, using several methods based on
   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) models. Accounting for phylogeny, we also
   examined the effects of habitat, locomotion type, distance from the
   equator and IMI on interspecific variation in tail length-body size
   relation. Primate tail length is not sexually dimorphic. A phylogenetic
   reconstruction allowing multiple optima explains the observed regime
   shifts best. During the evolutionary history of primates, relative tail
   length changed 50 times under an OU model. Specifically, relative tail
   length increased 26 and decreased 24 times. Most of these changes
   occurred among Old World primates. Among the variables tested here,
   interspecific variation in IMI and the difference between leaping and
   non-leaping locomotion explained interspecific variation in relative
   tail length: Evolutionary decreases in relative tail length are
   generally associated with an increase in IMI and an absence of leaping
   behavior. Conclusions Regime shifts for relative tail length in living
   primates occurred in concert with fundamental changes in IMI and a
   change from leaping to non-leaping locomotion, or vice versa. Exceptions
   from this general pattern are linked to the presence of a prehensile
   tail or specialized foraging strategies. Thus, the primate tail appears
   to have evolved in functional coordination with limb proportions,

Title = {Calpain-10 regulates actin dynamics by proteolysis of

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 13},
Abstract = {Calpain-10 (CAPN10) is the calpain family protease identified as the
   first candidate susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
   However, the detailed molecular mechanism has not yet been elucidated.
   Here we report that CAPN10 processes microtubule associated protein 1
   (MAP1) family proteins into heavy and light chains and regulates their
   binding activities to microtubules and actin filaments.
   Immunofluorescent analysis of Capn10(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts
   shows that MAP1B, a member of the MAP1 family of proteins, is localized
   at actin filaments rather than at microtubules. Furthermore,
   fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching analysis shows that
   calpain-10 regulates actin dynamics via MAP1B cleavage. Moreover, in
   pancreatic islets from CAPN10 knockout mice, insulin secretion was
   significantly increased both at the high and low glucose levels. These
   findings indicate that deficiency of calpain-10 expression may affect
   insulin secretion by abnormal actin reorganization, coordination and
   dynamics through MAP1 family processing.},

Title = {Longitudinal study of rat volar fat pad fixation and ethanol storage:
   implications for the use of fluid-preserved specimens in morphological
   studies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANATOMY},

Volume = {233},

Abstract = {Museum fluid collections preserve important biological specimens for
   study. Tissues are often fixed in 10\% buffered formalin to halt
   metabolic activities and transferred to a solution of ethanol for
   long-term storage. This process, however, forces water from the tissues
   and has been shown to alter the morphology of preserved specimens in
   ways that may influence the biological interpretation of results. The
   degree to which fluid preservation alters morphology is linked to
   multiple biological factors, such as tissue size and composition, and
   should therefore be examined prior to functional analysis. This study is
   undertaken as part of a more inclusive examination of mammalian volar
   morphology. A sample of five adult male and five adult female rats
   (Rattus norvegicus) was utilized to evaluate longitudinal changes in the
   dimensions of the volar pads across fixation in 10\% buffered formalin
   and preservation in 70\% ethanol for 1 year. No significant changes to
   the measured dimensions of the rat volar pads were present across stages
   of fixation and preservation, and no significant interactions of
   specimen size or sex were noted. These findings indicate that small
   mammalian volar pads that have been fixed in 10\% buffered formalin and
   stored in 70\% ethanol are appropriate for morphological study using the
   measurements described here without corrective algorithms. This finding
   is rare among preservation studies but highlights the variability of
   tissue behavior during chemical preservation and the necessity of
   preliminary investigations of preservation artifacts. Concurrence here
   between the preserved and unpreserved samples is likely related to the
   anhydrous nature of the volar pads and the supporting skeletal
   structure, and their confined position between major joints of the hands
   and feet.},

Title = {Odontogenic abscesses in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) of Cayo
   Santiago},

Volume = {167},

Abstract = {Objectives
   Odontogenic abscesses are one of the most common dental diseases causing
   maxillofacial skeletal lesions. They affect the individual's ability to
   maintain the dental structures necessary to obtain adequate nutrition
   for survival and reproduction. In this study, the prevalence and pattern
   of odontogenic abscesses in relation to age, sex, matriline, and living
   periods were investigated in adult rhesus macaque skeletons of the
   free-ranging colony on Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico.
   Materials and MethodsResultsThe skulls used for this study were from the
   skeletons of 752 adult rhesus macaques, aged 8-31years, and born between
   1951 and 2000. They came from 66 matrilines ranging from 1 to 88
   individuals. Fistulae or skeletal lesions caused by odontogenic
   abscesses drainage, carious lesions, tooth fractures, tooth loss, and
   alveolar resorption were evaluated visually.
   Seventy-two specimens (9.57\%) had odontogenic abscesses of varying
   severity. Males had a significantly higher prevalence than females. The
   prevalence of odontogenic abscesses in several matrilines was
   significantly higher than in the population as a whole. Animals born
   between 1950 and 1965 tended to have a higher prevalence of odontogenic
   abscesses than those born in later periods.
   DiscussionThese results suggest that oral pathologies, such as dental
   and periodontal abscesses in rhesus macaques are fairly common, which
   may indicate familial effects interwoven with ecological and social
   factors. The closeness of the rhesus and human genomes allows insights
   to understand of the epidemiology of these diseases in the human
   population. Further assessment of the role played by environmental and
   familial factors on rhesus oral health and disease are warranted.},

Title = {Overmarking by adult females in four equid species: social bonds and
   group cohesion},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {306},
Number = {3},
Pages = {180-188},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Scent marking by overmarking deposits made by conspecifics has been well
   studied in male mammals, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood
   and rarely studied in females. Furthermore, in socially living mammals
   like most ungulate species many of the established hypotheses cannot be
   applied, leaving the function of female overmarking unexplained. In this
   study, we suggest and test a novel hypothesis: maintenance of social
   bonds. We examined the occurrence of adult female overmarking in equids
   and test three classical hypotheses which may explain this phenomenon:
   group cohesion, intrasexual competition and social hierarchy. We
   observed all African equid species (Equus africanus, E. grevyi, E.
   quagga, E. zebra) in five zoos. In total, we recorded 4668 eliminations
   by 130 individuals; 327 of these events were overmarked by 69 individual
   females representing all species. Adult females overmarked individuals
   of each age and sex category, but mostly other females and foals. The
   rate of overmarking within a dyad of adult females increased with
   increasing `friendship' of the dyad, thus demonstrating for the first
   time that overmarking can serve to support social bonds in mammals. In
   addition, we found a higher overmarking rate among females in the
   temporary absence of a stallion than in his presence suggesting partial
   support for the group cohesion hypothesis. On the other hand, we found
   no evidence supporting hypotheses of intrasexual competition and social
   hierarchy. We suggest that the use of overmarking to maintain social
   bonds may be more important in mammals like equids that live in groups
   of unrelated individuals.},

Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {The estimated period in which human colonization of Madagascar began has
   expanded recently to 5000-1000 y B.P., six times its range in 1990,
   prompting revised thinking about early migration sources, routes,
   maritime capability and environmental changes. Cited evidence of
   colonization age includes anthropogenic palaeoecological data 2500-2000
   y B.P., megafaunal butchery marks 4200-1900 y B.P. and OSL dating to
   4400 y B.P. of the Lakaton'i Anja occupation site. Using large samples
   of newly-excavated bone from sites in which megafaunal butchery was
   earlier dated >2000 y B.P. we find no butchery marks until similar to
   1200 y B.P., with associated sedimentary and palynological data of
   initial human impact about the same time. Close analysis of the
   Lakaton'i Anja chronology suggests the site dates <1500 y B.P. Diverse
   evidence from bone damage, palaeoecology, genomic and linguistic
   history, archaeology, introduced biota and seafaring capability indicate

   research has documented the nesting habits of captive orangutans,
   including potential social and environmental influences of nest site
   selections. We documented the night nesting behavior of six adult
   orangutans housed at the Smithsonian's National Zoological Park (NZP),
   identifying preferred nest locations and proximity to conspecifics,
   comparing observed patterns to those reported in a nest behavior survey
   of orangutan facilities throughout the Association of Zoos and Aquariums
   (AZA). Survey results reveal that in addition to several universal
   patterns of nesting behaviors, as in the wild, the sharing of night
   nests by captive adult orangutans occurs only rarely (2 of 31 surveyed
   facilities). Data collected at NZP indicate that night nearest neighbor
   associations among nesting conspecifics may be a useful proxy for actual
   nearest neighbor data taken during daytime social interactions and may
   offer a more feasible alternative for determining social relationships
   among large groups of socially housed orangutans.},

Abstract = {When faced with harsh environmental conditions, the South American
   marsupial, monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides), reduces its body
   temperature and uses either daily torpor or multiday hibernation to
   survive. This study used ELISA and multiplex assays to characterize the
   responses to hibernation by three regulatory components of protein
   translation machinery {[}p-eIF2 alpha(S51), p-eIF4E(S209),
   p-4EBP(Thr37/46)] and eight targets involved in upstream signaling
   control of translation {[}p-IGF-1R(Tyr1135/1136), PTEN(S380),
   p-Akt(5473), p-GSK-3 alpha(S21), p-GSK-3 beta(S9), p-TSC2(S939),
   p-mTOR(S2448), and p70S6K(T412)]. Liver, brain and kidney were analyzed
   comparing control and hibernation (4 days continuous torpor) conditions.
   In the liver, increased phosphorylation of IGF-IR, Akt, GSK-3 beta,
   TSC2, mTOR, eIF2 alpha, and 4EBP (1.60-1.98 fold compared to control)
   occurred during torpor suggesting that the regulatory phosphorylation
   cascade and protein synthesis remained active during torpor. However,
   responses by brain and kidney differed; torpor resulted in increased
   phosphorylation of GSK-3 beta (2.15-4.17 fold) and TSC2 (2.03-3.65
   fold), but phosphorylated Akt decreased (to 34-62\% of control levels).
   Torpor also led to an increase in phosphorylated eIF2 alpha (1.4 fold)
   content in the brain. These patterns of differential protein
   phosphorylation in brain and kidney were indicative of suppression of
   protein translation but also could suggest an increase in antioxidant
   and anti-apoptotic signaling during torpor. Previous studies of liver
   metabolism in hibernating eutherian mammals have shown that Akt kinase
   and its downstream signaling components play roles in facilitating
   hypometabolism by suppressing energy expensive anabolic processes during
   torpor. However, the results in this study reveal differences between
   eutherian and marsupial hibernators, suggesting alternative actions of
   liver Akt during torpor.},

Title = {Assessment of Male Reproductive Skew via Highly Polymorphic STR Markers

Abstract = {Male reproductive strategies have been well studied in primate species
   where the ability of males to monopolize reproductive access is high.
   Less is known about species where males cannot monopolize mating access.
   Vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) are interesting in this regard
   as female codominance reduces the potential for male monopolization.
   Under this condition, we assessed whether male dominance rank still
   influences male mating and reproductive success, by assigning
   paternities to infants in a population of wild vervets in the Eastern
   Cape, South Africa. To determine paternity, we established
   microsatellite markers from noninvasive fecal samples via cross-species
   amplification. In addition, we evaluated male mating and reproductive
   success for 3 groups over 4 mating seasons. We identified 21 highly
   polymorphic microsatellites (number of alleles = 7.5 +/- 3.1 {[}mean +/-
   SD], observed heterozygosity = 0.691 +/- 0.138 {[}mean +/- SD]) and
   assigned paternity to 94 of 97 sampled infants (96.9\%) with high
   confidence. Matings pooled over 4 seasons were significantly skewed
   across 3 groups, although skew indices were low (B index = 0.023-0.030)
   and mating success did not correlate with male dominance. Paternities
   pooled over 4 seasons were not consistently significantly skewed (B
   index = 0.005-0.062), with high-ranking males siring more offspring than
   subordinates only in some seasons. We detected 6 cases of extra-group
   paternity (6.4\%) and 4 cases of natal breeding (4.3\%). Our results
   suggest that alternative reproductive strategies besides priority of
   access for dominant males are likely to affect paternity success,
   warranting further investigation into the determinants of paternity
   among species with limited male monopolization potential.},

Abstract = {In cooperative breeders, reproductive skew is extreme and leads to
   intense intrasexual competition for access to reproduction in both
   sexes. Given that securing the dominant position is costly, dominant
   animals should direct their aggressiveness towards same-sex subordinates
   that are potential competitors. Chemical communication has been reported
   to be involved in intrasexual competition in several mammalian species,
   and odour may be used as a cue to identify potential competitors. We
   predicted that odour should inform on sexual maturity, sex and social
   status in cooperative breeders. We tested these predictions in the
   Alpine marmot, a cooperatively breeding species, in which anal gland
   secretions are involved in aggressive behaviour. We sampled anal gland
   scents from 154 individuals of differing sexual maturity status, sex and
   social status. We found that anal gland secretions may inform on sexual
   maturity. When focusing on adult individuals, we found that anal gland
   scent differed according to sex and social status. Our results support
   the hypothesis that anal gland scent could be involved in intrasexual
   competition in Alpine marmots by allowing dominant individuals to target
   their aggressiveness towards same-sex competitors (i.e. sexually mature
   subordinates), resulting in the reproductive suppression of
   subordinates.},

Title = {The critical role of dietary foliage in maintaining the gut microbiome
   and metabolome of folivorous sifakas},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {The gut microbiome (GMB) of folivores metabolizes dietary fiber into
   nutrients, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs); however,
   experiments probing the consequences of foliage quality on host GMBs are
   lacking. We therefore examined GMB structure and function via amplicon
   sequencing and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy in 31 captive
   sifakas (Propithecus coquereli) during dietary manipulations associated
   with husbandry. Supplementing standard diets with diverse foliage
   blends, versus with a single plant species, promoted more diverse GMBs,
   enriched for taxa implicated in plant-fiber metabolism, but depleted in
   taxa implicated in starch metabolism and bile tolerance. The consumption
   of diverse blends was associated with greater concentrations of colonic
   SCFAs. Abundant foliage, via forest access, promoted compositionally
   distinct and more stable GMBs, but reduced concentrations of SCFAs,
   possibly reflecting selection of high-quality leaves. In 11 subjects
   denied forest access, we examined the temporal pace of microbial shifts
   when supplemental foliage was abruptly switched between diverse blends
   and single species. The sifaka GMB responded within days, with community
   diversity and composition closely tracking foliage diversity. By
   providing experimental evidence that the folivore GMB is sensitive to
   minor changes in dietary foliage, we reveal the fragility of specialist
   GMBs, with implications for managing the wellbeing of endangered
   wildlife.},

Title = {Oldest evidence for grooming claws in euprimates},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {122},
Pages = {1-22},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Euprimates are unusual among mammals in having fingers and toes with
   flat nails. While it seems clear that the ancestral stock from which
   euprimates evolved had claw-bearing digits, the available fossil record
   has not yet contributed a detailed understanding of the transition from
   claws to nails. This study helps clarify the evolutionary history of the
   second pedal digit with fossils representing the distal phalanx of digit
   two (dpII), and has broader implications for other digits. Among extant
   primates, the keratinized structure on the pedal dpII widely varies in
   form. Extant strepsirrhines and tarsiers have narrow, distally tapering,
   dorsally inclined nails (termed a `grooming claws' for their use in
   auto-grooming), while extant anthropoids have more typical nails that
   are wider and lack distal tapering or dorsal inclination. At least two
   fossil primate species thought to be stem members of the Strepsirrhini
   appear to have had grooming claws, yet reconstructions of the ancestral
   euprimate condition based on direct evidence from the fossil record are
   ambiguous due to inadequate fossil evidence for the earliest
   haplorhines. Seven recently discovered, isolated distal phalanges from
   four early Eocene localities in Wyoming (USA) closely resemble those of
   the pedal dpII in extant prosimians. On the basis of faunal
   associations, size, and morphology, these specimens are recognized as
   the grooming phalanges of five genera of haplorhine primates, including
   one of the oldest known euprimates (similar to 56 Ma), Teilhardina
   brandti. Both the phylogenetic distribution and antiquity of primate
   grooming phalanges now strongly suggest that ancestral euprimates had
   grooming claws, that these structures were modified from a primitive
   claw rather than a flat nail, and that the evolutionary loss of
   `grooming claws' represents an apomorphy for crown anthropoids. (C) 2018

Abstract = {There has been, and continues to be, a dramatic shift in the human
   population towards older ages necessitating biomedical research aimed at
   better understanding the basic biology of aging and age-related diseases
   and facilitating new and improved therapeutic options. As it is not
   practical to perform the breadth of this research in humans, animal
   models are necessary to recapitulate the complexity of the aging
   environment. The mouse model is most frequently chosen for these
   endeavors, however, they are frequently not the most appropriate model.
   Non-human primates, on the other hand, are more closely related to
   humans and recapitulate the human aging process and development of
   age-related diseases. Extensive aging research has been performed in the
   well characterized rhesus macaque aging model. More recently, the common
   marmoset, a small non-human primate with a shorter lifespan, has been
   explored as a potential aging model. This model holds particular promise
   as an aging disease model in part due to the successful creation of
   transgenic marmosets. Limitations to the use of non-human primates in
   aging research exist but can be mitigated somewhat by the existence of
   available resources supported by the National Institutes of Health. This
   article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Animal models of aging -

Title = {Analysis, Modeling, and Control of Half-Bridge Current-Source Converter
   for Energy Management of Supercapacitor Modules in Traction Applications},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this work, an in-depth investigation was performed on the properties
   of the half-bridge current-source (HBCS) bidirectional direct current
   (DC)-to-DC converter, used to interface two DC-link voltage sources with
   a high-voltage-rating mismatch. The intended implementation is
   particularly suitable for the interfacing of a supercapacitor (SC)
   module and a battery stack in a hybrid storage system (HSS) for
   automotive applications. It is demonstrated that the use of a
   synchronous rectification (SR) modulation scheme benefits both the
   power-stage performance (in terms of efficiency and reliability) and the
   control-stage performance (in terms of simplicity and versatility).
   Furthermore, an average model of the converter, valid for every
   operating condition, is derived and utilized as a tool for the design of
   the control system. This model includes the effects of parasitic
   elements (mainly the leakage inductance of the transformer) and of the
   converter snubbers. A 3 kW prototype of the converter was used for
   experimental validation of the converter modeling, design, and
   performance. Finally, a discussion on the control strategy of the
   converter operation is included.},

Abstract = {The scarcity or complete lack of information on the adenoviruses (AdVs)
   occurring in the most ancient non-human primates resulted in the
   initiation of a study for exploring their abundance and diversity in
   prosimians and New World monkeys (NWMs). In order to assess the
   variability of these AdVs and the possible signs of the hypothesised
   virus-host co-evolution, samples from almost every family of NWMs and
   prosimians were screened for the presence of AdVs. A PCR-screening of
   171 faecal or organ samples from live or dead, captive or wild-living
   prosimians and NWMs was performed. The PCR products from the gene of the
   IVa2 protein were sequenced and used in phylogeny calculations. The
   presence of 10 and 15 new AdVs in seven and ten different species of
   prosimians and NWMs was revealed, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis
   indicated that the tentative novel AdVs cluster into two separate
   groups, which form the most basal branches among the primate AdVs, and
   therefore support the theory on the co-evolution of primate AdVs with
   their hosts. This is the first report that provides a comprehensive
   overview of the AdVs occurring in prosimians and NWMs, and the first
   insight into the evolutionary relationships among AdVs from all major
   primate groups.},

Title = {Antibacterial soap use impacts skin microbial communities in rural
   Madagascar},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {The skin harbors diverse communities of microorganisms, and alterations
   to these communities can impact the effectiveness of the skin as a
   barrier to infectious organisms or injury. As the global availability
   and adoption of antibacterial products increases, it is important to
   understand how these products affect skin microbial communities of
   people living in rural areas of developing countries, where risks of
   infection and injury often differ from urban populations in developed
   countries. We investigated the effect of antibacterial soap on skin
   microbial communities in a rural Malagasy population that practices
   subsistence agriculture in the absence of electricity and running water.
   We quantified the amount of soap used by each participant and obtained
   skin swab samples at three time points: prior to soap use, immediately
   after one week of soap use, and two weeks after soap use was
   discontinued. Soap use did not significantly impact ecological measures
   of diversity and richness (alpha diversity). However, the amount of soap
   used was a predictor of community-level change (beta diversity), with
   changes persisting for at least two weeks after subjects stopped using
   soap. Our results indicate that the overall species richness of skin
   microbial communities may be resistant to short-term use of
   antibacterial soap in settings characterized by regular contact with the
   natural environment, yet these communities may undergo shifts in
   microbial composition. Lifestyle changes associated with the use of
   antibacterial soap may therefore cause rapid alterations in skin
   microbial communities, with the potential for effects on skin health.},

   changes may be an important driver of these increases in blood pressure.
   Hypertension is particularly prevalent in African countries, though the
   majority of studies have focused on mainland Africa. We collected
   demographic and health data from 513 adults living in a community in
   rural Madagascar. We used generalized linear mixed models to assess body
   mass index (BMI), age, sex, and attributes related to household
   composition and lifestyle as predictors of blood pressure and
   hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension in this cohort was 49.1\%
   (both sexes combined: N = 513; females: 50.3\%, N = 290; males: 47.5\%,
   N = 223). Blood pressure, as well as hypertensive state, was positively
   associated with age and BMI. Lifestyle and household factors had no
   significant relationships with blood pressure. The prevalence of
   hypertension was similar to that found in urban centers of other African
   countries, yet almost double what has been previously found in
   Madagascar. Future research should investigate the drivers of
   hypertension in rural communities worldwide, as well as the lifestyle,
   cultural, and genetic factors that underlie variation in hypertension
   across space and time.},

Title = {Thoracic radiography of healthy captive male and female Squirrel monkey
   (Saimiri spp.)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {The purpose of this prospective study was to describe the normal anatomy
   and provide reference ranges for measurements of thoracic radiography on
   Squirrel monkeys (n = 13). Thoracic radiography is a common non-invasive
   diagnostic tool for both cardiac and noncardiac thoracic structures.
   Furthermore cardiac disease is a common condition in captive primates.
   In this study, left-right lateral, right-left lateral and dorsoventral
   projections of 13 healthy Squirrel monkeys were reviewed during their
   annual health examinations. The mean Vertebral Heart Score on the
   left-right and right-left lateral projections were 8,98 +/- 0,25 and
   8,85 +/- 0,35 respectively. The cardio-thoracic ratio on the
   dorsoventral projection was 0,68 +/- 0,03. The trachea to inlet ratio
   was 0,33 +/- 0,04. Other measurements are provided for the skeletal,
   cardiac and respiratory systems. Knowledge of the normal radiographic
   thoracic anatomy is fundamental in clinical as well as research settings
   for accurate diagnosis of diseases.},

Title = {Adaptive wear-based changes in dental topography associated with atelid

Volume = {124},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Primates are generally characterized by low-crowned, brachydont molars
   relative to many other groups of mammals. This conservative architecture
   may create special challenges for maintaining dental functionality in
   the case of a diet requiring proficient shearing ability (e.g.
   folivory). One recent hypothesis, the `dental sculpting hypothesis',
   suggests that some folivorous primates have dentitions that functionally
   harness macrowear in maintaining occlusal sharpness. We examined the
   relationships between four dental topography metrics {[}Dirichlet normal
   energy (DNE), orientation patch count rotated (OPCR), relief index (RFI)
   and occlusal relief (OR)] against macrowear {[}as measured by the
   dentine exposure ratio (DER)] in lower first molars of Ateles and
   Alouatta, which are two closely related platyrrhines with different
   diets (Alouatta is a folivore and Ateles a frugivore). We find support
   for the dental sculpting hypothesis, in that DNE increases with
   macrowear in the folivorous Alouatta but not in the frugivorous Ateles.
   Multiple contradictions between OPCR and the other variables suggest
   that this metric is a poor reflection of the molar form-function
   relationship in these primates. Distributions of relief measures (RFI
   and OR) confound expectations and prior observations, in that Ateles
   shows higher values than Alouatta, because these measures are thought to
   be correlated with dental shearing ability. We discuss the role that the
   relatively thicker enamel caps of Ateles might play in the distributions
   of these metrics.},

   library of 3.2 million cyclic peptides for compounds that disrupt this
   protein-protein interaction. We identified cyclo-CFFLYT as the lead
   inhibitor, and improved its activity through the incorporation of
   non-natural amino acids. The activity of the optimized cyclic peptide
   was assessed in hepatic cells, with a dose-dependent increase in LDLR
   levels observed in the presence of our IDOL homodimerization inhibitor.},

Abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative
   disease among the elderly. To understand its pathogenesis and to test
   therapies, animal models that faithfully reproduce key pathological PD
   hallmarks are needed. As a prelude to developing a model of PD, we
   tested the tropism, efficacy, biodistribution, and transcriptional
   effect of canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vectors in the brain of
   Microcebus murinus, a nonhuman primate that naturally develops
   neurodegenerative lesions. We show that introducing helper-dependent
   (HD) CAV-2 vectors results in long-term, neuron-specific expression at
   the injection site and in afferent nuclei. Although HD CAV-2 vector
   injection induced a modest transcriptional response, no significant
   adaptive immune response was generated. We then generated and tested HD
   CAV-2 vectors expressing leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and LRRK2
   carrying a G2019S mutation (LRRK2(G2019S)), which is linked to sporadic
   and familial autosomal dominant forms of PD. We show that
   HD-LRRK2(G2019S) expression induced parkinsonian-like motor symptoms and
   histological features in less than 4 months.},

Title = {Foundations for Forecasting: Defining Baseline Seismicity at Fuego
   Volcano, Guatemala},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Accurate volcanic eruption forecasting is especially challenging at open
   vent volcanoes with persistent low levels of activity and relatively
   sparse permanent monitoring networks. We present a description of
   seismicity observed at Fuego volcano in Guatemala during January of
   2012, a period representative of low-level, open-vent dynamics typical
   of the current eruptive period. We use this time to establish a baseline
   of activity from which to build more accurate forecasts. Seismicity
   consists of both harmonic and non-harmonic tremor, rockfalls, and a
   variety of signals associated with frequent small emissions from two
   vents. We categorize emissions into explosions and degassing events
   (each emitted from both vents); the seismic signatures from these two
   types of emissions are highly variable. We propose that both vents
   partially to fully seal between explosions. This model allows for the
   two types of emissions and accommodates the variety of seismic waveforms
   we recorded. In addition, there are many small discrete events not
   linked to eruptions that we examine in detail here. Of these events, 183
   are classified into 5 families of repeating, pulse-like long period
   (0.5-5Hz) events. Using arrival times from the 5 families and other
   high-quality events recorded on a temporary, nine-station network on the
   edifice of Fuego, we compute a 1-D velocity model and use it to locate
   earthquakes. The waveforms and shallow locations of the repeating
   families suggest that they are likely produced by rapid increases in gas
   pressure within a crack very near the surface, possibly within a sealed
   or partially sealed conduit. The framework from this study is a short
   but instrument intense observation period, activity description, seismic
   event detection, velocity modeling, and repose period analysis. This
   framework can act as a template for augmenting monitoring efforts at
   other under-studied volcanoes. Even relatively limited studies can at a
   minimum aid in drawing parallels between volcanic systems and improve
   comparisons.},

Title = {Using Phylogenomic Data to Explore the Effects of Relaxed Clocks and
   Calibration Strategies on Divergence Time Estimation: Primates as a Test
   Case},

Abstract = {Primates have long been a test case for the development of phylogenetic
   methods for divergence time estimation. Despite a large number of
   studies, however, the timing of origination of crown Primates relative
   to the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary and the timing of
   diversification of the main crown groups remain controversial. Here, we
   analysed a data set of 372 taxa (367 Primates and 5 outgroups, 3.4
   million aligned base pairs) that includes nine primate genomes. We
   systematically explore the effect of different interpretations of fossil
   calibrations and molecular clock models on primate divergence time
   estimates. We find that even small differences in the construction of
   fossil calibrations can have a noticeable impact on estimated divergence
   times, especially for the oldest nodes in the tree. Notably, choice of
   molecular rate model (autocorrelated or independently distributed rates)
   has an especially strong effect on estimated times, with the independent
   rates model producing considerably more ancient age estimates for the
   deeper nodes in the phylogeny. We implement thermodynamic integration,
   combined with Gaussian quadrature, in the program MCMCTree, and use it
   to calculate Bayes factors for clock models. Bayesian model selection
   indicates that the autocorrelated rates model fits the primate data
   substantially better, and we conclude that time estimates under this
   model should be preferred. We show that for eight core nodes in the
   phylogeny, uncertainty in time estimates is close to the theoretical
   limit imposed by fossil uncertainties. Thus, these estimates are
   unlikely to be improved by collecting additional molecular sequence
   data. All analyses place the origin of Primates close to the K-Pg
   boundary, either in the Cretaceous or straddling the boundary into the
   Palaeogene.},

Title = {A Novel Translational Model of Spinal Cord Injury in Nonhuman Primate},

Abstract = {Spinal cord injuries (SCI) lead to major disabilities affecting > 2.5
   million people worldwide. Major shortcomings in clinical translation
   result from multiple factors, including species differences, development
   of moderately predictive animal models, and differences in methodologies
   between preclinical and clinical studies. To overcome these obstacles,
   we first conducted a comparative neuroanatomical analysis of the spinal
   cord between mice, Microcebus murinus (a nonhuman primate), and humans.
   Next, we developed and characterized a new model of lateral spinal cord
   hemisection in M. murinus. Over a 3-month period after SCI, we carried
   out a detailed, longitudinal, behavioral follow-up associated with in
   vivo magnetic resonance imaging (H-1-MRI) monitoring. Then, we compared
   lesion extension and tissue alteration using 3 methods: in vivo H-1-MRI,
   ex vivo H-1-MRI, and classical histology. The general organization and
   glial cell distribution/morphology in the spinal cord of M. murinus
   closely resembles that of humans. Animals assessed at different stages
   following lateral hemisection of the spinal cord presented specific
   motor deficits and spinal cord tissue alterations. We also found a close
   correlation between H-1-MRI signal and microglia reactivity and/or
   associated post-trauma phenomena. Spinal cord hemisection in M. murinus
   provides a reliable new nonhuman primate model that can be used to
   promote translational research on SCI and represents a novel and more
   affordable alternative to larger primates.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesI report on the nocturnal behavior of Fongoli chimpanzees in a
   savanna mosaic during different seasons and lunar phases and test the
   hypothesis that hot daytime temperatures influence activity at night. I
   predicted that apes would be more active at night during periods of
   greater lunar illuminosity given diurnal primates' lack of visual
   specializations for low-light conditions and in dry season months when
   water scarcity exacerbated heat stress.
   Materials and MethodsI observed chimpanzees for 403 hrs on 40 nights
   between 2007 and 2013 and categorized their activity as social,
   movement, or vocalization. I scored their activity as occurring after
   moonrise or before moonset and considered the influence of moon phase
   (fuller versus darker phases) as well as season on chimpanzee nocturnal
   behavior in the analyses.
   ResultsResults indicate that apes were more active after moonrise or
   before moonset during fuller moon phases in the dry season but not the
   wet season. Most night-time activity involved movement (travel or
   forage), followed by social behavior, and long-distance vocal
   communication.
   DiscussionAnimals in highly seasonal habitats often exhibit
   thermoregulatory adaptations but, like other primates, chimpanzees lack
   physiological mechanisms to combat thermal stress. This study provides
   evidence that they may exhibit behaviors that allow them to avoid high
   temperatures in a savanna environment, such as feeding and socializing
   at night during the hottest time of year and in the brightest moon
   phases. The results support theories invoking thermal stress as a
   selective pressure for hominins in open environments where heat would
   constrain temporal foraging niches, and suggest an adaptability of
   sleeping patterns in response to external factors.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesSynthesize information on sleep patterns, sleep site use, and
   daytime predation at sleep sites in lorisiforms of Asia and Africa (10
   genera, 36 species), and infer patterns of evolution of sleep site
   selection.
   Materials and methodsWe conducted fieldwork in 12 African and six Asian
   countries, collecting data on sleep sites, timing of sleep and predation
   during daytime. We obtained additional information from literature and
   through correspondence. Using a phylogenetic approach, we established
   ancestral states of sleep site selection in lorisiforms and traced their
   evolution.
   ResultsThe ancestral lorisiform was a fur-clinger and used dense tangles
   and branches/forks as sleep sites. Use of tree holes and nests as sleep
   sites emerged approximate to 22 Mya (range 17-26 Mya) in Africa, and use
   of bamboo emerged approximate to 11 (7-14) Mya in Asia and later in
   Africa. Fur clinging and some sleep sites (e.g., tree holes, nests, but
   not bamboo or dense tangles) show strong phylogenetic signal. Nests are
   used by Galagoides, Paragalago, Galago and Otolemur; tree holes by
   Galago, Paragalago, Sciurocheirus and Perodicticus; tangles by
   Nycticebus, Loris, Galagoides, Galago, Euoticus, Otolemur, Perodicticus
   and Arctocebus; all but Sciurocheirus and Otolemur additionally sleep on
   branches/forks. Daytime predation may affect sleep site selection and
   sleep patterns in some species of Nycticebus, Galago, Galagoides,
   Otolemur and Perodicticus. Most lorisiforms enter their sleep sites
   around sunrise and leave around sunset; several are active during
   twilight or, briefly, during daytime.
   ConclusionVariations in sleep behavior, sleep patterns and vulnerability
   to daytime predation provide a window into the variation that was
   present in sleep in early primates. Overall, lorisiforms use the daytime
   for sleeping and no species can be classified as cathemeral or
   polycyclic.},

Abstract = {Wildlife activity patterns tend to be defined by terms such as diurnal
   and nocturnal that might not fully depict the complexity of a species'
   life history strategy and behavior in a given system. These activity
   pattern categories often influence the methodological approaches
   employed, including the temporal period of study (daylight or
   nighttime). We evaluated banded mongoose (Mungos mungo) behavior in
   Northern Botswana through the use of remote sensing cameras at active
   den sites in order to characterize early morning behavior for this
   diurnal species. Our approach, however, provided the facility to capture
   unexpected nocturnal activity in a species that had otherwise only been
   studied during daylight hours. Camera traps were deployed for 215 trap
   days (24 hour data capture period) at den sites, capturing 5,472 photos
   over all events. Nocturnal activity was identified in 3\% of trap days
   at study den sites with both vigilant and non-vigilant nocturnal
   behaviors identified. While vigilant behaviors involved troop fleeing
   responses, observations of non-vigilant behaviors suggest nonresident
   mongoose may investigate den sites of other troops during nocturnal time
   periods. There was no association between the occurrence of nocturnal
   activity and lunar phase (Fisher's exact test, n = 215, p = 0.638) and
   thus, increased moonlight was not identified as a factor influencing
   nocturnal behavior. The drivers and fitness consequences of these
   nocturnal activities remain uncertain and present intriguing areas for
   future research. Our findings highlight the need for ecological studies
   to more explicitly address and evaluate the potential for temporal
   variability in activity periods. Modifying our approach and embracing
   variation in wildlife activity patterns might provide new insights into
   the interaction between ecological phenomenon and species biology that
   spans the diurnal-nocturnal spectrum.},

Title = {Pro-inflammatory AGE-RAGE signaling is activated during arousal from
   hibernation in ground squirrel adipose},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 4},
Abstract = {Background. Inflammation is generally suppressed during hibernation, but
   select tissues (e.g. lung) have been shown to activate both antioxidant
   and pro-inflammatory pathways, particularly during arousal from torpor
   when breathing rates increase and oxidative metabolism fueling the
   rewarming process produces more reactive oxygen species. Brown and white
   adipose tissues are now understood to be major hubs for the regulation
   of immune and inflammatory responses, yet how these potentially damaging
   processes are regulated by fat tissues during hibernation has hardly
   been studied. The advanced glycation end-product receptor (RAGE) can
   induce pro-inflammatory responses when bound by AGEs (which are glycated
   and oxidized proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids) or damage associated
   molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs, which are released from dying
   cells).
   Methods. Since gene expression and protein synthesis are largely
   suppressed during torpor, increases in AGE-RAGE pathway proteins
   relative to a euthermic control could suggest some role for these
   pro-inflammatory mediators during hibernation. This study determined how
   the pro-inflammatory AGE-RAGE signaling pathway is regulated at six
   major time points of the torpor-arousal cycle in brown and white adipose
   from a model hibernator, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus. Immunoblotting,
   RT-qPCR, and a competitive ELISA were used to assess the relative gene
   expression and protein levels of key regulators of the AGE-RAGE pathway
   during a hibernation bout.
   Results. The results of this study revealed that RAGE is upregulated as
   animals arouse from torpor in both types of fat, but AGE and DAMP levels
   either remain unchanged or decrease. Downstream of the AGE-RAGE cascade,
   nfat5 was more highly expressed during arousal in brown adipose.
   Discussion. An increase in RAGE protein levels and elevated mRNA levels
   of the downstream transcription factor nfat5 during arousal suggest the
   pro-inflammatory response is upregulated in adipose tissue of the
   hibernating ground squirrel. It is unlikely that this cascade is
   activated by AGEs or DAMPs. This research sheds light on how a
   fat-but-fit organism with highly regulated metabolism may control the
   proinflammatory AGE-RAGE pathway, a signaling cascade that is often
   dysregulated in other obese organisms.},

Title = {Basicranium and face: Assessing the impact of morphological integration
   on primate evolution},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {118},
Pages = {43-55},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The basicranium and facial skeleton are two integrated structures
   displaying great morphological diversity across primates. Previous
   studies focusing on limited taxonomic samples have demonstrated that
   morphological integration has a significant impact on the evolution of
   these structures. However, this influence is still poorly understood. A
   more complete understanding of craniofacial integration across primates
   has important implications for functional hypotheses of primate
   evolution. In the present study, we analyzed a large sample of primate
   species to assess how integration affects the relationship between
   basicranial and facial evolutionary pathways across the order. First, we
   quantified integration and modularity between basicranium and face using
   phylogenetically-informed partial least squares analyses. Then, we
   defined the influence of morphological integration between these
   structures on rates of evolution, using a time-calibrated phylogenetic
   tree, and on disparity through time, comparing the morphological
   disparity across the tree with that expected under a pure Brownian
   process. Finally, we assessed the correlation between the basicranium
   and face, and three factors purported to have an important role in
   shaping these structures during evolution: endocranial volume,
   positional behavior (i.e., locomotion and posture), and diet. Our
   findings show that the face and basicranium, despite being highly
   integrated, display significantly different evolutionary rates. However,
   our results demonstrate that morphological integration impacted shape
   disparity through time. We also found that endocranial volume and
   positional behavior are important drivers of cranial shape evolution,
   partly affected by morphological integration. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Bone Marrow Is a Major Parasite Reservoir in Plasmodium vivax Infection},
Journal = {MBIO},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Plasmodium vivax causes heavy burdens of disease across malarious
   regions worldwide. Mature P. vivax asexual and transmissive gametocyte
   stages occur in the blood circulation, and it is often assumed that
   accumulation/sequestration in tissues is not an important phase in their
   development. Here, we present a systematic study of P. vivax stage
   distributions in infected tissues of nonhuman primate (NHP) malaria
   models as well as in blood from human infections. In a comparative
   analysis of the transcriptomes of P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum
   blood-stage parasites, we found a conserved cascade of stage-specific
   gene expression despite the greatly different gametocyte maturity times
   of these two species. Using this knowledge, we validated a set of
   conserved asexual-and gametocyte-stage markers both by quantitative
   real-time PCR and by antibody assays of peripheral blood samples from
   infected patients and NHP (Aotus sp.). Histological analyses of P. vivax
   parasites in organs of 13 infected NHP (Aotus and Saimiri species)
   demonstrated a major fraction of immature gametocytes in the parenchyma
   of the bone marrow, while asexual schizont forms were enriched to a
   somewhat lesser extent in this region of the bone marrow as well as in
   sinusoids of the liver. These findings suggest that the bone marrow is
   an important reservoir for gametocyte development and proliferation of
   malaria parasites.
   IMPORTANCE Plasmodium vivax malaria continues to cause major public
   health burdens worldwide. Yet, significant knowledge gaps in the basic
   biology and epidemiology of P. vivax malaria remain, largely due to
   limited available tools for research and diagnostics. Here, we present a
   systematic examination of tissue sequestration during P. vivax
   infection. Studies of nonhuman primates and malaria patients revealed
   enrichment of developing sexual stages (gametocytes) and mature
   replicative stages (schizonts) in the bone marrow and liver, relative to
   those present in peripheral blood. Identification of the bone marrow as
   a major P. vivax tissue reservoir has important implications for
   parasite diagnosis and treatment.},

Title = {Stress levels of dominants reflect underlying conflicts with
   subordinates in a cooperatively breeding species},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {72},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Maintaining dominance status had long been considered to be less
   stressful than subordination. However, no consistency in stress levels
   of dominant and subordinate individuals has been demonstrated. Tactics
   used to achieve and maintain dominance could be determinant. In
   cooperatively breeding species, conflicts between dominants and
   subordinates are expected since dominant individuals tend to monopolize
   reproduction while subordinates seldom reproduce. Reproductive skew
   models predict that subordinates' reproductive opportunities are either
   allotted or subject to competition with dominants. In the former case,
   no policing of subordinates by dominants is expected. In the latter,
   dominant should exert a control over the subordinates possibly leading
   to higher stress levels in dominants than in subordinates, which could
   be further elevated as the number of potential competitors in the group
   increases. In the present study, we aimed to test these hypotheses by
   assessing individual's stress level using the neutrophils to lymphocytes
   ratio (N:L) in a wild cooperatively breeding rodent, the Alpinemarmot
   (Marmota marmota). We found that dominants exhibit higher N:L ratio than
   subordinates and that dominants' N:L ratio increases with the number of
   unrelated same-sex subordinates in the group. We conclude that
   controlling unrelated subordinates is stressful for dominants, as
   expected under tug-of-war models. These stress patterns reveal
   conflicting relationships between dominants and subordinates over the
   reproduction and social status acquisition. This study highlights the
   influence of the nature, strength, and direction of conflicts on stress
   levels.
   Significance Statement
   In cooperatively breeding species, reproductive skew models predict that
   subordinates' reproductive opportunities are either allotted or subject
   to competition with dominants and, thus, can modulate the relative
   stress level between dominants and subordinates. In the first case, no
   policing of subordinates by dominants is expected, while in the second,
   dominant should exert a control over the subordinates which should lead
   to higher stress level in dominants than in subordinates, and
   particularly when subordinates are unrelated to the dominants. In Alpine
   marmots, we found that dominants exhibit higher stress level than
   subordinates and dominants' stress level increased with the number of
   unrelated same-sex subordinates. These patterns are in agreement with
   the predictions of the tug-of war models of reproductive skew and
   indicate that controlling subordinates is costly for dominants.},

Abstract = {While many preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been
   reported, none fully recapitulate the disease. In an effort to identify
   an appropriate preclinical disease model, we characterized age-related
   changes in 2 higher order species, the African green monkey (AGM) and
   the rhesus macaque. Gene expression profiles in the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex and the visual cortex showed age-related changes in
   AGMs that are strikingly reminiscent of AD, whereas aged rhesus were
   most similar to healthy elderly humans. Biochemically, age-related
   changes in AGM cerebrospinal fluid levels of tau, phospho-tau, and
   amyloid beta were consistent with AD. Histologically, aged AGMs
   displayed pathological hallmarks of the disease, plaques, and 2 AGMs
   showed evidence of neurofibrillary tangle-like structures. We
   hypothesized and confirmed that AGMs have age-related cognitive deficits
   via a prefrontal cortex-dependent cognition test, and that symptomatic
   treatments that improve cognition in AD patients show efficacy in AGMs.
   These data suggest that the AGM could represent a novel and improved
   translational model to assist in the development of therapeutics for AD.

Abstract = {Microbiologists often evaluate microbial community dynamics by
   formulating functional hypotheses based on ecological processes. Indeed,
   many of the methods and terms currently used to describe animal
   microbiomes derive from ecology and evolutionary biology. As our
   understanding of the composition and functional dynamics of ``the
   microbiome{''} grows, we increasingly refer to the host as an ecosystem
   within which microbial processes play out. Even so, an ecosystem service
   framework that extends to the context of the host has thus far been
   lacking. Here, we argue that ecosystem services are a useful framework
   with which to consider the value of microbes to their hosts. We discuss
   those ``microbiome services{''} in the specific context of the mammalian
   gut, providing a context from which to develop new hypotheses and to
   evaluate microbial functions in future studies and novel systems.},

Abstract = {Effective biodiversity conservation requires an understanding of the
   drivers of natural resource use. Few studies, however, have examined how
   motivations of natural resource users and attributes of local social
   organizations affect resource extraction over time. We aimed to identify
   which characteristics of individuals (taboos, food security,
   resource-related income), groups (village size, ease of access to
   education, proximity to park), and institutions (presence of enforcement
   mechanisms) best predicted use of multiple types of natural resources
   near a protected area during the past 1.5years and during respondents'
   lifetimes. Data were collected in 2013 via semi-structured interviews
   with 360 people across ten villages along the perimeter of Ankarana
   National Park (northern Madagascar). All recent and lifetime uses of
   natural resources examined were higher in villages close to the park and
   for respondents with a history of earning money from extracting natural
   resources. In addition, individuals with ancestral meat-related taboos
   were less likely to have extracted natural resources over their
   lifetime, while individuals who recently consumed meat were more likely
   to have extracted natural resources over the past 1.5years. All other
   variables were less important in explaining the use of natural
   resources. The results highlight that some drivers can be consistently
   important in predicting natural resource use and that simple models can
   have relatively high explanatory power even in the context of the
   (sometimes) illegal extraction of five different types of natural
   resources.},

Abstract = {Scents play an important role in the life of most terrestrial mammals
   and may transmit valuable information about conspecifics. Olfaction was
   long considered of low importance in Old World monkeys due to their
   relative reduction of olfactory structures and low incidence of
   scent-marking behavior but has been increasingly recognized for
   mediating social relationships in recent years. Yet, studies
   investigating the composition of their chemical cues remain scarce. In
   the present study, we analyzed the potential information content of
   chemicals present on the skin of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). We
   collected axillary secretions from 60 animals of the semifree-ranging
   population on Cayo Santiago (Puerto Rico, USA) with precleaned cotton
   swabs from which the secretions were subsequently extracted and analyzed
   by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Rhesus macaque axillary
   odorants varied in their overall similarity and composition. This
   variation was attributable to differences in sex, group membership, and
   kinship and further appeared to reflect age and rank in parts of our
   sample. The compounds most strongly associated with this variation
   primarily comprised larger molecular weight aldehydes and steroids. Such
   compounds are considered to be perceivable by the primate olfactory
   system through close-range interactions or through breakdown into
   smaller molecules by bacterial fermentation. Overall, our results
   provide additional evidence that odors of Old World monkeys reflect a
   wealth of potential information about their carrier, which provides the
   basis for chemical communication via body odors; however, its use by
   conspecifics needs to be confirmed in bioassays.
   Significance statement
   One prerequisite for olfactory communication is the presence of
   systematic variation in animal odors that is related to attributes such
   as age, sex, or kinship. The composition of odors has been examined in
   numerous mammals but, with the exception of humans, remains poorly
   understood in Old World monkeys and apes, taxonomic groups in which most
   species do not show scent-marking behavior. In the present study, we
   show that the composition of axillary secretions of an Old World monkey,
   the rhesus macaque, reflects sex, group membership, relatedness, and
   possibly also age and rank. This variation thus provides a basis for
   olfactory communication in Old World monkeys.},

Abstract = {The impact of resource exploitation by ancient human communities on
   Madagascar's environment is an area of intense debate. A fundamental
   question in the archaeology of Madagascar is the extent to which arrival
   of settlers, introduction of non-native plants and animals, and
   subsequent human exploitation of island biota, which catalyzed declines
   in biodiversity and significantly degraded environmental conditions.
   Fine-grained datasets, including zooarchaeological, archaeobotanical and
   other ecological evidence, are needed to assess the relationship between
   human resource exploitation and environmental change. On Madagascar, the
   resolution of zooarchaeological datasets is often reduced by poor
   preservation of faunal remains, making precise taxonomic identifications
   difficult, and few projects to-date have comprehensively assessed
   zooarchaeological data. Here, we present zooarchaeological data from
   three coastal villages in the Velondriake Marine Protected Area in
   southwest Madagascar, where human occupation spans from ca. 1400 BP to
   the present. Faunal remains from the Late Holocene sites of
   Antsaragnagnangy and Antsaragnasoa were identified using morphological
   analysis of remains, and a PCR-based bulk bone metabarcoding approach
   was applied at Andamotibe to molecularly identify fish and other
   vertebrates in a faunal assemblage that was particularly fragmented.
   Results were interpreted and contextualized using modern data on local
   fish diversity, climate and anthropogenic impacts on marine and
   estuarine habitats, as well as modern fishing practices (including
   preferred fishing grounds, tackle, taxonomic representation and volume
   of catch). Our use of multiple analytical and interpretative approaches
   has provided the most highly resolved view to date of past human
   subsistence in coastal southwest Madagascar. We contend that future
   research into human-environment dynamics on Madagascar should make use
   of diverse analytical methods, in order to more comprehensively evaluate
   past interactions between human communities and the native biota.
   Furthermore, we encourage an historical ecological approach, so that
   long-term perspectives on changing human-environment dynamics may be
   used to contextualize modern trends. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Abstract = {This work carries out a comparison of non-isolated topologies for power
   electronic converters applied to Hybrid Energy Storage Systems. At the
   considered application, several options for three-port circuits are
   evaluated when interfacing a DC link with two distinct electrical energy
   storage units. This work demonstrates how the proposed structure,
   referred to as Series-Parallel Connection, performs as a simple, compact
   and reliable approach, based on a modification of the H-bridge
   configuration. The main advantage of this solution is that an effective
   large voltage gain at one of the ports is attained by means of a simple
   topology, preventing the use of multilevel or galvanic-isolated power
   stages. The resulting structure is thoroughly compared against the most
   significant direct alternatives. The analysis carried out on the
   switching and conduction losses in the power switches of the target
   solution states the design constraints at which this solution shows a
   performance improvement. The experimental validations carried out on a
   10 kW prototype demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme,
   stating its benefits as well as its main limitations. As a conclusion,
   the Series-Parallel Connection shows a better performance in terms of
   efficiency, reliability and controllability in the target application of
   compensating grid or load variations in Non-Isolated Hybrid Storage
   Systems, with large mismatch in the storage device voltage ratings.},

Title = {Warning SINEs: Alu elements, evolution of the human brain, and the

Journal = {CHROMOSOME RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {93-111},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Alu elements are a highly successful family of primate-specific
   retrotransposons that have fundamentally shaped primate evolution,
   including the evolution of our own species. Alus play critical roles in
   the formation of neurological networks and the epigenetic regulation of
   biochemical processes throughout the central nervous system (CNS), and
   thus are hypothesized to have contributed to the origin of human
   cognition. Despite the benefits that Alus provide, deleterious Alu
   activity is associated with a number of neurological and
   neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, neurological networks are
   potentially vulnerable to the epigenetic dysregulation of Alu elements
   operating across the suite of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes that
   are critical for both mitochondrial and CNS function. Here, we highlight
   the beneficial neurological aspects of Alu elements as well as their
   potential to cause disease by disrupting key cellular processes across
   the CNS. We identify at least 37 neurological and neurodegenerative
   disorders wherein deleterious Alu activity has been implicated as a
   contributing factor for the manifestation of disease, and for many of
   these disorders, this activity is operating on genes that are essential
   for proper mitochondrial function. We conclude that the epigenetic
   dysregulation of Alu elements can ultimately disrupt mitochondrial
   homeostasis within the CNS. This mechanism is a plausible source for the
   incipient neuronal stress that is consistently observed across a
   spectrum of sporadic neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.},

Title = {Targeting and modelling urban energy retrofits using a city-scale energy
   mapping approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {174},
Pages = {401-412},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {City authorities, community groups and retrofit installers need to
   identify suitable local areas and dwellings for installing energy
   retrofit measures. This paper presents a localised Geographical
   Information System (GIS) based approach that utilizes publicly-available
   national and local datasets on housing and energy to provide targeted
   low carbon measures across UK cities. The study uses a rapid city-level
   energy assessment approach to spatially identify suitable neighbourhoods
   for particular retrofit measures, based on relative energy use and fuel
   poverty ratings. A GIS-based carbon mapping model (called DECoRuM) is
   then used to estimate energy use and potential for energy reduction on a
   house-by-house level. The improvement measures are aggregated to
   encourage bulk installations and drive down installation costs.
   To identify an appropriate neighbourhood case study area, publicly
   available datasets were assessed for the town of Bicester (Oxfordshire,
   UK), which included Ordnance Survey Mastermap, Energy Performance
   Certificate data (EPC) and sub-national energy statistics available at
   lower layer super output area (LSOA). When the EPC data for Bicester
   were compared with the sub-national statistics for Bicester, the average
   difference was found to be similar to 800 kWh. This is interesting as
   EPCs represent dwelling specific but modelled data whereas sub-national
   datasets represent actual but aggregated data. Superimposing the above
   datasets, a neighbourhood in southwest Bicester was selected as having
   the highest percentage of dwellings with energy consumption >300
   kWh/m(2)/yr (EPC), most dwellings in need of wall insulation (EPC),
   second highest mean total energy consumption (sub-national), and third
   highest percentage of fuel poor dwellings (sub-national). House-level
   energy assessment in the selected area using DECoRuM showed that a
   package based approach comprising fabric and heating system upgrade and
   solar PVs emerged as the most effective. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Chemical composition of glandular secretions from a pair-living
   monogamous primate: Sex, age, and gland differences in captive and wild
   owl monkeys (Aotus spp.)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {80},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Broadening our knowledge of olfactory communication in strictly
   monogamous systems can inform our understanding of how chemosignals may
   facilitate social and reproductive behavior between the sexes. Compared
   to other social and mating systems, relatively little is known about
   olfactory communication in strictly monogamous non-human primates.
   Furthermore, platyrrhines are not well represented in chemical analyses
   of glandular secretions. We conducted semi-quantitative headspace gas
   chromatography with mass spectrometry to investigate the chemical
   components of glandular secretions from the subcaudal and pectoral
   glands of a strictly pair-living platyrrhine, the owl monkey (Aotus
   spp.). In this study, the first chemical analysis of a wild platyrrhine
   population, our goals were to (1) conduct a robust analysis of glandular
   secretions from both captive and wild owl monkey populations and (2)
   identify whether biologically relevant traits are present in glandular
   secretions. We also compared and contrasted the results between two
   Aotus species in different environmental contexts: wild Aotus azarae
   (N=33) and captive A. nancymaae (N=104). Our findings indicate that
   secretions from both populations encode sex, gland of origin, and
   possibly individual identity. These consistent patterns across species
   and contexts suggest that secretions may function as chemosignals. Our
   data also show that wild A. azarae individuals are chemically
   discriminated by age (adult or subadult). Among the captive A.
   nanycmaae, we found chemical differences associated with location,
   possibly caused by dietary differences. However, there was no noticeable
   effect of contraception on the chemical profiles of females, nor
   evidence that closely related individuals exhibit more similar chemical
   profiles in A. nancymaae. Overall, our data suggest that glandular
   secretions of both wild and captive Aotus convey specific information.
   Future studies should use behavioral bioassays to evaluate the ability
   of owl monkeys to detect signals, and consider whether odor may
   ultimately facilitate social and sexual relationships between male and
   female owl monkeys.},

Abstract = {Phalangeriform marsupials have often been compared with primates because
   of similarity in the range of external morphology, ecological niches,
   and body size between the two radiations. We explore morphological
   convergence in the masticatory anatomy of strepsirrhine primates and
   phalangeriforms, through osteological measurements of the mandible and
   facial skeleton, and through dissection of the masticatory musculature,
   presenting new data on the arrangement and proportions of jaw adductors
   in phalangeriforms. Phalangeriforms and primates have a large number of
   shape differences in mandibular morphology. Despite these differences in
   shape on phylogenetic lines, dietary groups used to pool species of
   phalangeriforms and strepsirrhines also differed from each other in a
   range of shape variables. Notably, the striped possum (Dactylopsila),
   previously described as convergent with the aye-aye (Daubentonia),
   shares a number of features of mandibular shape with Daubentonia, and
   the exudate-feeding sugar-glider, Petaurus, shares shape features with
   gummivorous strepsirrhines. Petaurus also has long-fibered jaw adductors
   for its body mass, as would be expected for a species with a requirement
   for large gape. Phalangeriform species on the frugivore-folivore
   continuum were less clearly comparable to strepsirrhine species with
   similar diets. There are a number of significant dietary contrasts in
   osteological measurements, but in the masticatory muscles
   phalangeriforms did not meet all expectations based on available dietary
   data, highlighting the possible complexity of dietary adaptation in
   phalangeriform folivores. ((C) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Title = {A new, large-bodied omnivorous bat (Noctilionoidea: Mystacinidae)
   reveals lost morphological and ecological diversity since the Miocene in
   New Zealand},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {A new genus and species of fossil bat is described from New Zealand's
   only pre-Pleistocene Cenozoic terrestrial fauna, the early Miocene St
   Bathans Fauna of Central Otago, South Island. Bayesian total evidence
   phylogenetic analysis places this new Southern Hemisphere taxon among
   the burrowing bats (mystacinids) of New Zealand and Australia, although
   its lower dentition also resembles Africa's endemic sucker-footed bats
   (myzopodids). As the first new bat genus to be added to New Zealand's
   fauna in more than 150 years, it provides new insight into the original
   diversity of chiropterans in Australasia. It also underscores the
   significant decline in morphological diversity that has taken place in
   the highly distinctive, semi-terrestrial bat family Mystacinidae since
   the Miocene. This bat was relatively large, with an estimated body mass
   of -40 g, and its dentition suggests it had an omnivorous diet. Its
   striking dental autapomorphies, including development of a large
   hypocone, signal a shift of diet compared with other mystacinids, and
   may provide evidence of an adaptive radiation in feeding strategy in
   this group of noctilionoid bats.},

Abstract = {To gain insight into how mammalian gene expression is controlled by
   rapidly evolving regulatory elements, we jointly analysed promoter and
   enhancer activity with downstream transcription levels in liver samples
   from 15 species. Genes associated with complex regulatory landscapes
   generally exhibit high expression levels that remain evolutionarily
   stable. While the number of regulatory elements is the key driver of
   transcriptional output and resilience, regulatory conservation matters:
   elements active across mammals most effectively stabilize gene
   expression. In contrast, recently evolved enhancers typically contribute
   weakly, consistent with their high evolutionary plasticity. These
   effects are observed across the entire mammalian clade and are robust to
   potential confounders, such as the gene expression level. Using liver as
   a representative somatic tissue, our results illuminate how the
   evolutionary stability of gene expression is profoundly entwined with
   both the number and conservation of surrounding promoters and enhancers.},

Abstract = {In the past few years, researchers and practitioners have highlighted
   the potential of Blockchain (BC) and distributed ledger technology to
   revolutionize government processes. Blockchain technology enables
   distributed power and embedded security. As such, Blockchain is regarded
   as an innovative, general purpose technology, offering new ways of
   organization in many domains, including e-government for transactions
   and information exchange. However, due to its very characteristics of
   peer to peer information exchange, its distributed nature, the still
   developing technology, the involvement of new actors, roles, etc., the
   implementation of blockchain applications raise issues that need
   governance attention. BC initiatives have implications for citizen
   trust, privacy, inclusion and participation. Governmental organizations
   need a thorough understanding of the BC design principles, the possible
   applications in the domain of e-government and the exploration of
   governance mechanisms to deal with the limitations and challenges of the
   BC technology when used in a myriad of sectors, ranging from the
   financial and business sector to the social domains of healthcare and
   education. In this panel we explore the impact of block chain technology
   on all levels of government and create an awareness of effects or
   applications in society that raise governance issues.},

Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with increasing
   incidence across the world and no cure at the present time. Anideal
   animal modelwould facilitate the understanding of the pathogenesis
   ofADand discovery of potential therapeutic targets. The Chinese tree
   shrew (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) has a closer genetic affinity to
   primates relative to rodents, and can attain ages of 8 years or older,
   which represents another advantage for the study of neurodegenerative
   diseases such as AD compared to primates. Here, we analyzed 131
   AD-related genes in the Chinese tree shrew brain tissues based on
   protein sequence identity, positive selection, mRNA, and protein
   expression by comparing with those of human, rhesus monkey, and mouse.
   In particular, we focused on the A beta and neurofibrillary tangles
   formation pathways, which are crucial to AD pathogenesis. The Chinese
   tree shrew had a generally higher sequence identity with human than that
   of mouse versus human for the AD pathway genes. There was no apparent
   selection on the tree shrew lineage for the AD-related genes. Moreover,
   expression pattern of the A beta and neurofibrillary tangle formation
   pathway genes in tree shrew brain tissues resembled that of human brain
   tissues, with a similar aging-dependent effect. Our results provided an
   essential genetic basis for future AD research using the tree shrew as a
   viable model.},

Abstract = {This work proposes a methodology for selecting the optimal
   configuration, in terms of energy efficiency, in power conversion
   applications. The outcomes of the selection are both the power topology
   among different options, together with a set of parameters for the
   design variables for that topology ensuring the highest efficiency for
   the target operating conditions. An example of this methodology is
   provided for a Hybrid Energy Storage System application in a given
   nanogrid. Two options for the power converter topology are presented,
   and also each of them is assessed in two basic operation modes:
   islanding mode and transient support mode. The final methodology
   provides a tool for selecting among the optimal power topology design
   considering the total efficiency of the system.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the design of a wideband electrically small antenna
   using internally loaded Non-Foster circuit. The negative capacitance
   provided by the circuit can significantly compensate the high reactance
   of the antenna and match it in a wide bandwidth. However in order to
   accurately predict the behaviour of the active antenna, the EM model of
   the non-foster circuit is taken into account in the full wave simulation
   of the antenna. The loaded antenna having an electrical size ka = 0.3 is
   matched in a wideband (34\%).},

   information contained in CAPs as a means to guide this review. The
   primary genetics-based topics that are mentioned in CAPs are genetic
   connectivity, inbreeding, and subspecies/species delimitation. I discuss
   these topics as well as historical demographic inference and
   hybridization using examples from wild primate species to illustrate the
   myriad ways in which genetics can assist in conservation efforts. I also
   discuss some recent technological advances such as genomic capture
   techniques and the potential to do molecular work in remote locations.},

Title = {Patterns of dental emergence in early anthropoid primates from the Fayum
   Depression, Egypt},
Journal = {HISTORICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {157-165},
Abstract = {Paleontological field work in the Fayum Depression of Egypt has produced
   a remarkable diversity of fossil anthropoids, and this, combined with
   advances in genetic analyses of living anthropoids, has led to
   establishment of a temporal and phylogenetic framework for anthropoids
   that is achieving some degree of consensus. Less well understood are the
   evolutionary mechanisms and selective factors behind the origin and
   early diversification of anthropoids. One area that has remained under
   explored is investigation into the life history patterns of early
   anthropoids, a major omission given that understanding patterns of
   growth and development is essential for interpreting the paleobiology of
   fossil species. Here we detail dental emergence sequences for five
   species in four families of early anthropoid primates from the Fayum,
   and use these data to test Schultz's Rule concerning the timing of
   emergence of molars versus premolars in mammals. Two important results
   are generated: (1) only one species had a dental eruption sequence
   identical to that observed among crown catarrhine primates; and (2) in
   all cases, the permanent canine was the last post-incisor dental element
   to fully erupt, a finding that may be significant for interpreting early
   anthropoid behavioral strategies.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the dynamic control of the DC bus voltage and the
   AC voltage magnitude and frequency in a hybrid DC/AC Microgrid (MG). In
   order to allow a high penetration of renewable energies, provide an
   increased system reliability during islanding and reduce the dependency
   on the mains, Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) are included in both the DC
   and AC grids. The MG is composed by a multiport solid-state-based
   transformation center, with connexion to the mains and a central battery
   energy storage system (BESS), and a flexible number of AC Nanogrids
   (NGs) coupled to a Low Voltage DC bus (LVDC) through DC/AC 3-phase Power
   Electronic Converters (PECs) operated as grid forming, hereinafter
   referred as Nanogrid Head Converters (NGHCs). The MG control presents
   two main characteristics: 1) A DC bus regulation scheme is proposed
   based on DC virtual generators and P/V DC droop that allows to adapt the
   participation in the power sharing for DC bus regulation and provides
   with an automatic transition between grid connected and islanding modes;
   2) In order to provide a cooperative operation between the different AC
   NGs, allowing the automatic power sharing between them through the DC
   bus, a DC/AC virtual generator control scheme, based on the theory of
   Virtual Synchronous Machines (VSM), is proposed for its implementation
   in the NGHCs, thus coupling the control of the LVDC and the NGs. The
   theoretical discussion is supported with simulations.},

Abstract = {Javan gibbons consume different foods to fulfil their nutrient
   requirement. We analyzed foods eaten by Javan gibbons for their nutrient
   content in Citalahab area, Gunung Halimun-Salak National Park (GHSNP),
   Indonesia. The goal was to assess amounts of water content, ash, crude
   fats, crude protein, crude fibers, carbohydrate and gross energy to
   determine whether there was nutritional variation between foods eaten by
   females and males. A total 43 food plant parts representing 33 plant
   species were collected, processed and analyzed. Females and males in
   Javan gibbons have similar diets with regard to overall composition.
   Nutrient analyses revealed high water content, ash and crude protein in
   young leaves; flowers and ripe fruits contained the most carbohydrate;
   crude fats content was highest in unripe fruits; ripe fruits were rich
   in crude fibers and gross energy content was high in all the main plant
   foods. Individual exhibit higher intake of certain nutrients by
   increasing feeding intake rate seems to be the key to greater nutrient
   intake in individual. This data adds our knowledge about nutritional
   composition of foods eaten by Javan gibbons and provides valuable
   comparative data for optimizing the diets of Javan gibbons ex situ.},

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},

Abstract = {Previous studies found that aye-ayes (Daubentonia madagascariensis)
   consume a variety of non-invertebrate resources, supporting the
   hypothesis that aye-ayes are too large-bodied to focus feeding efforts
   on insects. However, these conclusions were based on introduced
   populations, with little known about aye-aye behaviour and ecology in
   its natural habitat. This study investigates activity budgets, diet, and
   home range/ territories of 2 male aye-ayes in the Kianjavato Classified
   Forest, a disturbed forest in southeastern Madagascar, from October 2013
   to October 2014. We used radiotelemetry and focal-animal sampling
   methods to collect behavioural data. We recorded GPS coordinates of the
   focal animal every 20 min, calculating the home range size for each
   individual. Results showed that male aye-ayes spent most of their time
   feeding and travelling. Their feeding time primarily focussed on larvae
   and adult insects from various substrates, and to a lesser extent
   Canarium spp. seeds. Home range sizes of the 2 males varied between
   individuals, overlapped greatly, and appeared to be related to the
   location of females. Our findings indicate that aye-aye behaviours are
   strongly indicative of insect-centric feeding ecology.},

Title = {New adapiform primate fossils from the late Eocene of Egypt},
Journal = {HISTORICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {204-226},
Abstract = {Caenopithecine adapiform primates are currently represented by two
   genera from the late Eocene of Egypt (Afradapis and Aframonius) and one
   from the middle Eocene of Switzerland (Caenopithecus). All are somewhat
   anthropoid-like in several aspects of their dental and gnathic
   morphology, and are inferred to have been highly folivorous. Here we
   describe a new caenopithecine genus and species, Masradapis tahai, from
   the similar to 37million-year-old Locality BQ-2 in Egypt, that is
   represented by mandibular and maxillary fragments and isolated teeth.
   Masradapis is approximately the same size as Aframonius but differs in
   having a more dramatic distal increase in molar size, more complex upper
   molar shearing crests, and an exceptionally deep mandibular corpus. We
   also describe additional mandibles and part of the orbit and rostrum of
   Aframonius which suggest that it was probably diurnal. Phylogenetic
   analyses place Masradapis either as the sister taxon of Aframonius
   (parsimony), or as the sister taxon of Afradapis and Caenopithecus
   (Bayesian methods). Bayesian tip-dating analysis, when combined with
   Bayesian biogeographic analysis, suggests that a common ancestor of
   known caenopithecines dispersed to Afro-Arabia from Europe between 49.4
   and 47.4Ma, and that a trans-Tethyan back-dispersal explains
   Caenopithecus' later presence in Europe.For Masradapis:

Title = {Specialized wear facets and late ontogeny in mammalian dentitions},
Journal = {HISTORICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {7-29},
Abstract = {Many types of wear facets can be found in mammalian teeth. Some are
   related to the initial surface, others use the cross-section of the
   enamel as the main tool. In primary occlusal surfaces facets mark the
   gradual wear, that are related to a relatively late ontogeny. Facets in
   teeth with secondary occlusal surfaces, however, represent specific
   arrangements of crests of enamel and dentine. Such facets require some
   initial wear to become fully functional. The tooth morphology guarantees
   such facets to be effective for a long period of time. Therefore they
   can be discriminated as specialized facets. From the different types of
   facets three specialized ones were selected, blade facets, rasp-facets,
   and nipper-facets, because they ate widely distributed, function
   differently, and are comparable with mechanical tools. They are long
   lasting and differ in the amount of exposed dentine. The amount of
   dentine is used to differentiate phases during late ontogeny, the part
   of the life history, when teeth are exposed to wear. Consequently the
   various types of facets can be related to different ontogenetic phases.
   The relevant phases are prolonged at the cost of other ontogenetic
   phases. Therefore, the various specialized wear facets represent
   heterochronies within the ontogeny of teeth.},

Abstract = {When confronted by environmental stress, organisms can employ
   physiological and biochemical adaptations for survival. These include
   hibernation, estivation, anhydrobiosis, anaerobiosis, and freeze
   tolerance. Underlying most of these is strong metabolic rate depression
   that suppresses rates of ATP-expensive processes like transcription,
   translation, and protein degradation to achieve major energy savings.
   Chaperone proteins are crucial to hypometabolism; helping to preserve
   cell viability and stabilize the proteome over extended periods of time.
   Two types of chaperones are important to the stress response: heat shock
   proteins (HSP) and glucose regulated proteins (GRP). Both act to fold
   new proteins or refold damaged and unfolded proteins, and can also have
   anti-apoptotic or other protective roles. This review summarizes recent
   knowledge on the involvement of HSP and GRP in animal responses to
   environmental stress, showing that chaperone upregulation is a
   consistent feature of hypometabolism. Hibernating mammals, cold-hardy
   insects, anoxic turtles, and dehydrated frogs and snails all show
   upregulation in HSP and GRP gene or protein expression during seasonal
   or stress-induced dormancies. This widespread chaperone response to
   environmental stress also provides insights into ways to improve
   strategies for medical applications such as organ preservation or
   combating diseases where oxidative and proteotoxic stresses contribute
   to the condition.},

Abstract = {Measuring hormone metabolites in fecal samples allows the noninvasive
   assessment of some steroid hormones in primates. However, noninvasive
   hormone assays need analytical and biological validation owing to
   variation in hormone metabolism and excretion between the sexes and
   across species. We aimed to validate the measurement of fecal
   glucocorticoid (fGC), testosterone (fT), and progesterone (fP)
   metabolites in 15 captive stumptail macaques (Macaca arctoides). We
   collected fecal samples before and after we induced a stress response by
   restraining and injecting the subjects with saline solution. We then
   measured hormone metabolites using a methanol extraction technique and
   I-125 radioimmunoassay kits. We analyzed the change in glucocorticoid
   production before and after the stressor, as well as sexual and social
   rank differences. For fT metabolite levels we investigated variation
   with sex, age, and social rank, and for fP metabolite levels, we tested
   for sexual and cycle phase differences. We found a significant increase
   in fGC metabolite levels 22-25 h poststressor in both sexes. The
   increase was greater in high-ranking than in low-ranking individuals.
   Levels of fT metabolites were higher in males than in females,
   correlated positively with rank only in males, and correlated negatively
   with age in both sexes. fP metabolite levels were higher in females than
   in males, and were higher during the luteal phase than in the follicular
   phase. These findings indicate that our assays reliably detected
   hormonal changes related to stress (fGC) and detected differences
   between social and sexual categories (fT, fP) in stumptail macaques.},

Title = {The role of MEF2 transcription factors in dehydration and anoxia
   survival in Rana sylvatica skeletal muscle},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {The wood frog (Rana sylvatica) can endure freezing of up to 65\% of
   total body water during winter. When frozen, wood frogs enter a dormant
   state characterized by a cessation of vital functions (i.e., no
   heartbeat, blood circulation, breathing, brain activity, or movement).
   Wood frogs utilize various behavioural and biochemical adaptations to
   survive extreme freezing and component anoxia and dehydration stresses,
   including a global suppression of metabolic functions and gene
   expression. The stress-responsive myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2)
   transcription factor family regulates the selective expression of genes
   involved in glucose transport, protein quality control, and phosphagen
   homeostasis. This study examined the role of MEF2A and MEF2C proteins as
   well as select downstream targets (glucose transporter-4, calreticulin,
   and muscle and brain creatine kinase isozyrnes) in 40\% dehydration and
   24 h anoxia exposure at the transcriptional, translational, and
   post-translational levels using qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, and subcellular
   localization. Mef2a/c transcript levels remained constant during
   dehydration and anoxia. Total, cytoplasmic, and nuclear MEF2A/C and
   phospho-MEF2A/C protein levels remained constant during dehydration,
   whereas a decrease in total MEF2C levels was observed during
   rehydration. Total and phospho-MEF2A levels remained constant during
   anoxia, whereas total MEF2C levels decreased during 24 h anoxia and
   P-MEF2C levels increased during 4 h anoxia. In contrast, cytoplasmic
   MEF2A levels and nuclear phospho-MEF2A/C levels were lupregulated during
   anoxia. MEF2 downstream targets remained constant during dehydration and
   anoxia, with the exception of glut4 which was upregulated during anoxia.
   These results suggest that the upregulated MEF2 response reported in
   wood frogs during freezing may in part stem from their cellular
   responses to surviving prolonged anoxia, rather than dehydration,
   leading to an increase in GLUT4 expression which may have an important
   role during anoxia survival.},

Title = {Relative tooth size at birth in primates: Life history correlates},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {ObjectivesDental eruption schedules have been closely linked to life
   history variables. Here we examine a sample of 50 perinatal primates (28
   species) to determine whether life history traits correlate with
   relative tooth size at birth.
   Materials and methodsNewborn primates were studied using serial
   histological sectioning. Volumes of deciduous premolars (dp(2)-dp(4)),
   replacement teeth (if any), and permanent molars (M1-2/3) of the upper
   jaw were measured and residuals from cranial length were calculated with
   least squares regressions to obtain relative dental volumes (RDVs).
   ResultsRelative dental volumes of deciduous or permanent teeth have an
   unclear relationship with relative neonatal mass in all primates.
   Relative palatal length (RPL), used as a proxy for midfacial size, is
   significantly, positively correlated with larger deciduous and permanent
   postcanine teeth. However, when strepsirrhines alone are examined,
   larger RPL is correlated with smaller RDV of permanent teeth. In the
   full sample, RDVs of deciduous premolars are significantly negatively
   correlated with relative gestation length (RGL), but have no clear
   relationship with relative weaning age. RDVs of molars lack a clear
   relationship with RGL; later weaning is associated with larger molar
   RDV, although correlations are not significant. When strepsirrhines
   alone are analyzed, clearer trends are present: longer gestations or
   later weaning are associated with smaller deciduous and larger permanent
   postcanine teeth (only gestational length correlations are significant).
   DiscussionOur results indicate a broad trend that primates with the
   shortest RGLs precociously develop deciduous teeth; in strepsirrhines,
   the opposite trend is seen for permanent molars. Anthropoids delay
   growth of permanent teeth, while strepsirrhines with short RGLs are
   growing replacement teeth concurrently. A comparison of neonatal volumes
   with existing information on extent of cusp mineralization indicates
   that growth of tooth germs and cusp mineralization may be selected for
   independently.},

Title = {Facing the facts: The Runx2 gene is associated with variation in facial
   morphology in primates},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {139-151},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The phylogenetic and adaptive factors that cause variation in primate
   facial form including differences among the major primate clades and
   variation related to feeding and/or social behavior are relatively well
   understood. However, comparatively little is known about the genetic
   mechanisms that underlie diversity in facial form in primates. Because
   it is essential for osteoblastic differentiation and skeletal
   development, the runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) is one gene
   that may play a role in these genetic mechanisms. Specifically,
   polymorphisms in the QA ratio (determined by the ratio of the number of
   polyglutamines to polyalanines in one functional domain of Runx2) have
   been shown to be correlated with variation in facial length and
   orientation in other mammal groups. However, to date, the relationship
   between variation in this gene and variation in facial form in primates
   has not been explicitly tested. To test the hypothesis that the QA ratio
   is correlated with facial form in primates, the current study quantified
   the QA ratio, facial length, and facial angle in a sample of 33 primate
   species and tested for correlation using phylogenetic generalized least
   squares. The results indicate that the QA ratio of the Runx2 gene is
   positively correlated with variation in relative facial length in
   anthropoid primates. However, no correlation was found in
   strepsirrhines, and there was no correlation between facial angle and
   the QA ratio in any groups. These results suggest that, in primates, the
   QA ratio of the Runx2 gene may play a role in modulating facial size,
   but not facial orientation. This study therefore provides important
   clues about the genetic and developmental mechanisms that may underlie
   variation in facial form in primates. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Comparing the use of live trees and deadwood for larval foraging by

Abstract = {Aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) feeding behavior has become
   synonymous with deadwood foraging. However, deadwood is not always the
   most frequently used substrate, as some aye-ayes use live trees more
   often to access invertebrates. We sought to compare the frequency of
   aye-aye invertebrate foraging in deadwood and live trees to better
   understand their feeding behaviors. We followed two male aye-ayes at
   Kianjavato, a heavily disturbed habitat in southeastern Madagascar, from
   October 2013 to October 2014, and one male and one female aye-aye at
   Torotorofotsy, a continuous forest in eastern Madagascar, from July 2014
   to December 2015. We collected feeding data by recording the behavior of
   a focal aye-aye every 5 min for a total of 373 h at Kianjavato and 383 h
   at Torotorofotsy. Our results showed no difference in the amount of
   deadwood used between the individuals. However, there was a significant
   difference in the amount of live tree feeding between the female at
   Torotorofotsy and one of the males at Kianjavato. We conclude that
   feeding on invertebrates in live trees is more important to aye-ayes
   than previously realized and that aye-ayes are exceedingly flexible in
   their invertebrate feeding behaviors, adjusting to their habitat by
   using various substrates.},

Title = {Resilience of experimentally seeded dietary traditions in wild vervets:
   Evidence from group fissions},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {79},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Controlled laboratory experiments have delivered extensive and
   compelling evidence for the diffusion and maintenance of socially
   learned behavior in primates and other animals. Such evidence is rarer
   in the wild, but we show that a behavior seeded in a majority of
   individuals within vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythus) groups may be
   sustained across several years. Here, we report results of two natural
   fission events in such groups that offer novel evidence of the
   resilience of socially transmitted group norms of behavior. Before
   fission, high ranked females exhibited an almost exclusive adherence to
   a group preference among two food options, originally introduced through
   a distasteful additive in one option, but no longer present in repeated
   later tests. Because of rank-dependent competition, low-ranked females
   ate more of the formerly distasteful food and so discovered it was now
   as palatable as the alternative. Despite this experience, low ranked
   females who formed the splinter groups then expressed a 100\% bias for
   the preferred option of their original parent group, revealing these
   preferences to be resilient. We interpret this effect as conformity to
   either the preferences of high rankers or of a majority in the parent
   group, or both. However, given fissioned individuals' familiarity with
   their habitat and experimental options, we question the adequacy of the
   informational function usually ascribed to conformity and discuss
   alternatives under a concept of ``social conformity{''}.},

Title = {Searching for the Haplorrhine Heterotherm: Field and Laboratory Data of
   Free-Ranging Tarsiers},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {The observation of heterothermy in a single suborder (Strepsirrhini)
   only within the primates is puzzling. Given that the placental-mammal
   ancestor was likely a heterotherm, we explored the potential for
   heterothermy in a primate closely related to the Strepsirrhini. Based
   upon phylogeny, body size and habitat stability since the Late Eocene,
   we selected western tarsiers (Cephalopachus bancanus) from the island of
   Borneo. Being the sister clade to Strepsirrhini and basal in Haplorrhini
   (monkeys and apes), we hypothesized that C. bancanus might have retained
   the heterothermic capacity observed in several small strepsirrhines. We
   measured resting metabolic rate, subcutaneous temperature, evaporative
   water loss and the percentage of heat dissipated through evaporation, at
   ambient temperatures between 22 and 35 degrees C in fresh-caught wild
   animals (126.1 +/- 2.4 g). We also measured core body temperatures in
   free-ranging animals. The thermoneutral zone was 25-30 degrees C and the
   basalmetabolic rate was 3.52 +/- 0.06W.kg(-1) (0.65 +/- 0.01 ml
   O-2.g(-1).h(-1)). There was no evidence of adaptive heterothermy in
   either the laboratory data or the free-ranging data. Instead, animals
   appeared to be cold sensitive (T-b similar to 31 degrees C) at the
   lowest temperatures. We discuss possible reasons for the apparent lack
   of heterothermy in tarsiers, and identify putative heterotherms within
   Platyrrhini. We also document our concern for the vulnerability of C.
   bancanus to future temperature increases associated with global warming.},

Title = {GPS-identified, low-level nocturnal activity of vervets (Chlorocebus
   pygerythrus) and olive baboons (Papio anubis) in Laikipia, Kenya},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2017},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives: Except for owl monkeys (Aotus spp.), all anthropoid primates
   are considered strictly diurnal. Recent studies leveraging new
   technologies have shown, however, that some diurnal anthropoids also
   engage in nocturnal activity. Here we examine the extent to which
   vervets (Chlor-ocebus pygerythrus) and olive baboons (Papio anubis) are
   active at night.
   Materials and Methods: We deployed GPS collars with tri-axial
   accelerometer data loggers on 18 free-ranging adult females: 12 vervets
   spread among 5 social groups, and 6 olive baboons spread among 4 groups.
   Their locations were recorded every 15 min, and their activity levels,
   for 3 s/min over 7.5 months. We also used camera traps that were
   triggered by heat and movement at seven sleeping sites.
   Results: Travel was detected on 0.4\% of 2,029 vervet-nights involving 3
   vervets and 1.1\% of 1,109 baboon-nights involving 5 baboons. Travel was
   mainly arboreal for vervets but mainly terrestrial for baboons. During
   the night, vervets and baboons were active 13\% and 15\% of the time,
   respectively. Activity varied little throughout the night and appeared
   unaffected by moon phase.
   Discussion: Our results confirm the low nocturnality of vervets and
   olive baboons, which we suggest is related to living near the equator
   with consistent 12-hr days, in contrast to other anthropoids that are
   more active at night. Since anthropoid primates are thought to have
   evolved in northern latitudes, with later dispersal to tropical
   latitudes, our results may have implications for understanding the
   evolution of anthropoid diurnality.},

Abstract = {Our ever-increasing understanding of biological systems is providing a
   range of exciting novel biological targets, whose modulation may enable
   novel therapeutic options for many diseases. These targets include
   protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, which are,
   however, often refractory to classical small-molecule approaches. Other
   types of molecules, or modalities, are therefore required to address
   these targets, which has led several academic research groups and
   pharmaceutical companies to increasingly use the concept of socalled
   ``new modalities{''}. This Review defines for the first time the scope
   of this term, which includes novel peptidic scaffolds, oligonucleotides,
   hybrids, molecular conjugates, as well as new uses of classical small
   molecules. We provide the most representative examples of these
   modalities to target large binding surface areas such as those found in
   protein-protein interactions and for biological processes at the center
   of cell regulation.},

Abstract = {Many zoos are committed to conservation efforts and answering applied
   questions about veterinary care and welfare. It is less common, however,
   for basic science to be conducted in zoos. Comparative cognitive
   research run in zoos is gaining momentum, with more zoos becoming
   involved and a greater diversity of species being studied. The majority
   of cognitive research in zoos is conducted with primates, bears, and
   elephants. There is less cognitive research run with other species, in
   particular birds, reptiles and insects, or with zoo visitors. Given the
   number and variety of animals they house, zoos offer a unique forum to
   expand the taxonomic focus of cognitive research, especially via
   multi-institutional collaborations, whilst creating an opportunity to
   foster public engagement with research.},

Title = {Patterns of seasonality and group membership characterize the gut

Abstract = {The intestinal microbiota plays a major role in host development,
   metabolism, and health. To date, few longitudinal studies have
   investigated the causes and consequences of microbiota variation in
   wildlife, although such studies provide a comparative context for
   interpreting the adaptive significance of findings from studies on
   humans or captive animals. Here, we investigate the impact of
   seasonality, diet, group membership, sex, age, and reproductive state on
   gut microbiota composition in a wild population of group-living,
   frugi-folivorous primates, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi).
   We repeatedly sampled 32 individually recognizable animals from eight
   adjacent groups over the course of two different climatic seasons. We
   used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to determine the
   microbiota composition of 187 fecal samples. We demonstrate a clear
   pattern of seasonal variation in the intestinal microbiota, especially
   affecting the Firmicutes-Bacteroidetes ratio, which may be driven by
   seasonal differences in diet. The relative abundances of certain
   polysaccharide-fermenting taxa, for example, Lachnospiraceae, were
   correlated with fruit and fiber consumption. Additionally, group
   membership influenced microbiota composition independent of season, but
   further studies are needed to determine whether this pattern is driven
   by group divergences in diet, social contacts, or genetic factors. In
   accordance with findings in other wild mammals and primates with
   seasonally fluctuating food availability, we demonstrate seasonal
   variation in the microbiota of wild Verreaux's sifakas, which may be
   driven by food availability. This study adds to mounting evidence that
   variation in the intestinal microbiota may play an important role in the
   ability of primates to cope with seasonal variation in food
   availability.},

Title = {Selection to outsmart the germs: The evolution of disease recognition
   and social cognition},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {92-109},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The emergence of providing care to diseased conspecifics must have been
   a turning point during the evolution of hominin sociality. On a
   population level, care may have minimized the costs of socially
   transmitted diseases at a time of increasing social complexity, although
   individual care-givers probably incurred increased transmission risks.
   We propose that care-giving likely originated within kin networks, where
   the costs may have been balanced by fitness increases obtained through
   caring for ill kin. We test a novel hypothesis of hominin cognitive
   evolution in which disease may have selected for the cognitive ability
   to recognize when a conspecific is infected. Because diseases may
   produce symptoms that are likely detectable via the perceptual-cognitive
   pathways integral to social cognition, we suggest that disease
   recognition and social cognition may have evolved together. Using
   agent-based modeling, we test 1) under what conditions disease can
   select for increasing disease recognition and care-giving among kin, 2)
   whether providing care produces greater selection for cognition than an
   avoidance strategy, and 3) whether care-giving alters the progression of
   the disease through the population. The greatest selection was produced
   by diseases with lower risks to the care-giver and prevalences low
   enough not to disrupt the kin networks. When care-giving and avoidance
   strategies were compared, only care-giving reduced the severity of the
   disease outbreaks and subsequent population crashes. The greatest
   selection for increased cognitive abilities occurred early in the model
   runs when the outbreaks and population crashes were most severe.
   Therefore, over the course of human evolution, repeated introductions of
   novel diseases into naive populations could have produced sustained
   selection for increased disease recognition and care-giving behavior,
   leading to the evolution of increased cognition, social complexity, and,
   eventually, medical care in humans. Finally, we lay out predictions
   derived from our disease recognition hypothesis that we encourage
   paleoanthropologists, bioarchaeologists, primatologists, and
   paleogeneticists to test. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Ageing results from the accumulation of multifactorial damage over time.
   However, the temporal distribution of this damage remains unknown. In
   seasonal species, transitions between seasons are critical periods of
   massive physiological remodelling. We hypothesised that these recurrent
   peaks of physiological remodelling are costly in terms of survival. We
   tested whether captive small primates exposed to an experimentally
   increased frequency of seasonal transitions die sooner than individuals
   living under natural seasonality. The results show that experiencing one
   additional season per year increases the mortality hazard by a factor of
   3 to 4, whereas the expected number of seasons lived is only slightly
   impacted by the seasonal rhythm. These results demonstrate that
   physiological transitions between periods of high and low metabolic
   activity represent a major mortality risk for seasonal organisms, which
   has been ignored until now.},

Title = {Applying wet sieving fecal particle size measurement to frugivores: A
   case study of the eastern chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {163},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objectives: Fecal particle size (FPS) as quantified by wet sieving
   analysis is a measure of chewing efficiency relevant for the
   understanding of physiological adaptations and constraints in
   herbivores. FPS has not been investigated systematically in frugivores,
   and important methodological problems remain. In particular, food items
   that are not chewed may skew estimates of FPS. We address such
   methodological issues and also assess the influence of diet type and age
   on FPS in wild chimpanzees.
   Materials and Methods: About 130 fecal samples of 38 individual
   chimpanzees (aged from 1.3 to similar to 55 years) from the Kanyawara
   community of Kibale National Park (Uganda) were collected during three
   fruit seasons and analyzed using standardized wet sieves (pores from 16
   to 0.025 mm). The effects of using different sieve series and excluding
   large seeds were investigated. We also assessed the relationship between
   FPS and sex, age, and fruit season.
   Results: The treatment of seeds during the sieving process had a large
   influence on the results. FPS was not influenced by chimpanzee sex or
   age, but was smaller during a fig season (0.88 +/- 0.31 mm) than during
   two drupe-fruit seasons (1.68 +/- 0.37 mm) (0.025-4 mm sieves, excluding
   seeds).
   Discussion: The absence of an age effect on FPS suggests that dental
   senescence might be less critical in chimpanzees, or in frugivores in
   general, than in folivorous herbivores. To increase the value of FPS
   studies for understanding frugivore and hominoid dietary evolution we
   propose modifications to prior herbivore protocols.},

Abstract = {Regenerative approaches are promising avenues to effectively cure
   diseases rather than merely treating symptoms, but are associated with
   concerns around proliferation in other organs. Given that targeted
   delivery holds the promise of delivering a drug precisely to its desired
   site of action, usually with the prospect of increasing the therapeutic
   index, it can be considered as an essential enabler of regenerative
   medicines. Although significant progress has been made predominantly in
   oncology for the delivery of cytotoxic drugs using antibody-drug
   conjugates (ADCs), the physiological conditions and safety requirements
   for regenerative medicines are very different. Drug conjugates need to
   be approached differently and, we herein suggest using a broader range
   of homing modalities and a specific framework to develop safe linkers.},

Title = {The seasonal feeding ecology of the javan slow loris (nycticebus

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {162},
Number = {4},
Pages = {768-781},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives: To describe the strategy employed by exudativorous primates
   during seasonal shifts in food abundance using the Javan slow loris as a
   model. Males and females may cope differently as well as exploit
   fallback foods in different proportions.
   Materials and methods: Observing 15 free ranging Javan slow lorises over
   a year, we quantified their seasonal diet and nutrient intake using
   intake rates. For gum intake rates, we conducted a trial with 10 captive
   Javan slow lorises measuring the length of time it took for them to
   ingest 10 g of gum. We monitored phenology in our field site over five
   plots that were assessed monthly. We weighed our free-ranging animals
   every six months. We analyzed all food items slow lorises ingested for
   macronutrients using the nutritional geometry framework.
   Results: The slow loris diet consisted of eight food categories, with
   gum and insects being the major food sources in terms of wet weight
   intake. The captive gum trials resulted in an intake rate of 0.021 g/s.
   All food items eaten by wild Javan slow lorises were available in the
   wet season and were restricted in the dry season. Males and females
   reacted differently to seasonal abundances with females ingesting more
   protein, gum, fruits and flowers and males ingesting more fiber.
   Conclusions: The strategy used by the Javan slow lorises during periods
   of lower food availability were similar to folivorous primates and
   included increased dependence on lower quality foods. The reproductive
   costs of gestation and lactation may place a burden on females that
   requires them to alter their foraging strategy during the dry season to
   ensure enough protein and overall energy is ingested. The overall
   strategy used by these exudativorous primates is one of nutrient
   maximization as no nutrient was clearly preferred over another.},

Title = {The Importance of Protein in Leaf Selection of Folivorous Primates},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {79},
Number = {4, SI},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Protein limitation has been considered a key factor in hypotheses on the
   evolution of life history and animal communities, suggesting that
   animals should prioritize protein in their food choice. This contrasts
   with the limited support that food selection studies have provided for
   such a priority in nonhuman primates, particularly for folivores. Here,
   we suggest that this discrepancy can be resolved if folivores only need
   to select for high protein leaves when average protein concentration in
   the habitat is low. To test the prediction, we applied meta-analyses to
   analyze published and unpublished results of food selection for protein
   and fiber concentrations from 24 studies (some with multiple species) of
   folivorous primates. To counter potential methodological flaws, we
   differentiated between methods analyzing total nitrogen and soluble
   protein concentrations. We used a meta-analysis to test for the effect
   of protein on food selection by primates and found a significant effect
   of soluble protein concentrations, but a non-significant effect for
   total nitrogen. Furthermore, selection for soluble protein was
   reinforced in forests where protein was less available. Selection for
   low fiber content was significant but unrelated to the fiber
   concentrations in representative leaf samples of a given forest. There
   was no relationship (either negative or positive) between the
   concentration of protein and fiber in the food or in representative
   samples of leaves. Overall our study suggests that protein selection is
   influenced by the protein availability in the environment, explaining
   the sometimes contradictory results in previous studies on protein
   selection. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Journal = {DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {96},
Pages = {83-91},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Researchers and practitioners highlight the potential for information
   systems to promote sustainability in agricultural production, but little
   is known about the private and social benefits of specific agricultural
   decision support tools. In this study, we utilize the resource-based
   view to assess a specific green technology using an
   agricultural-economics simulation to estimate the quantitative benefits
   of this technology expressed as dollars saved and reduced greenhouse gas
   emissions. In particular, we employ a five-step simulation modeling
   approach within a micro-economic model of crop production to assess the
   ability of yield monitors to promote liquefied petroleum (LP) gas
   savings and subsequently reduce production costs, reduce greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions associated with LP gas burning, and generate additional
   revenue at a market for GHG mitigation credits. We estimate that the
   total benefits of using the green IS to improve the harvesting decision
   would have been \$82 million in post-harvest cost savings and a
   significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. We present this
   simulation modeling approach, a common methodology in environmental
   sciences and economics, as a viable methodology for IS researchers
   interested in modeling intricate decision-making processes that are
   impacted by technology. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Does cortical bone thickness in the last sacral vertebra differ among
   tail types in primates?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {162},
Number = {4},
Pages = {757-767},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Objectives: The external morphology of the sacrum is demonstrably
   informative regarding tail type (i. e., tail presence/absence, length,
   and prehensility) in living and extinct primates. However, little
   research has focused on the relationship between tail type and internal
   sacral morphology, a potentially important source of functional
   information when fossil sacra are incomplete. Here, we determine if
   cortical bone cross-sectional thickness of the last sacral vertebral
   body differs among tail types in extant primates and can be used to
   reconstruct tail types in extinct primates.
   Materials and Methods: Cortical bone cross-sectional thickness in the
   last sacral vertebral body was measured from high-resolution CT scans
   belonging to 20 extant primate species (N=72) assigned to tail type
   categories ({''}tailless,{''} ``nonprehensile short-tailed,{''} ``
   nonprehensile long-tailed,{''} and `` prehensile-tailed{''}). The extant
   dataset was then used to reconstruct the tail types for four extinct
   primate species.
   Results: Tailless primates had significantly thinner cortical bone than
   tail-bearing primates. Nonprehensile short-tailed primates had
   significantly thinner cortical bone than nonprehensile longtailed
   primates. Cortical bone cross- sectional thickness did not distinguish
   between prehensiletailedand nonprehensile long-tailed taxa. Results are
   strongly influenced by phylogeny. Corroborating previous studies,
   Epipliopithecus vindobonensis was reconstructed as tailless,
   Archaeolemur edwardsi as long-tailed, Megaladapis grandidieri as
   nonprehensile short-tailed, and Palaeopropithecus kelyus as
   nonprehensile short-tailed or tailless.
   Conclusions: Results indicate that, in the context of phylogenetic
   clade, measures of cortical bone cross-sectional thickness can be used
   to allocate extinct primate species to tail type categories.},

Abstract = {Larvae of the goldenrod gall moth, Epiblema scudderiana, use the freeze
   avoidance strategy of cold hardiness to survive the winter. Here we
   report that protein kinase-dependent signal transduction featuring
   mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascades
   (extracellular signal regulated kinase, c-jun N-terminal kinase and p38
   MAPK pathways) and the Akt (also known as protein kinase B, or PKB)
   pathway could be integral parts of the development of cold hardiness by
   E. scudderiana. We used Luminex technology to assess the protein levels
   and phosphorylation status of key components and downstream targets of
   those pathways in larvae in response to low temperature acclimation. The
   data showed that MAPK pathways (both total protein and phosphorylated
   MAPK targets) were inhibited after 5 degrees C acclimation, but not -15
   degrees C exposure, as compared with the 15 degrees C control group.
   However, total heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) levels increased
   dramatically by similar to 12-fold in the -15 degrees C acclimated
   insects. Elevated HSP27 may facilitate anti-apoptotic mechanisms in an
   Akt-dependent fashion. By contrast, both 5 and -15 degrees C acclimation
   produced signs of Akt pathway activation. In particular, the inhibitor
   phosphorylated Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3a (pGSK3) levels remained high
   in cold-exposed larvae. Additionally, activation of the Akt pathway
   might also facilitate inhibition of apoptosis independently of GSK3.
   Overall, the current study indicates that both MAPK and Akt signal
   transduction may play essential roles in freeze avoidance by E.

Title = {Social context-dependent relationships between mouse dominance rank and

Abstract = {The associations between social status and endogenous testosterone and
   corticosterone have been well-studied across taxa, including rodents.
   Dominant social status is typically associated with higher levels of
   circulating testosterone and lower levels of circulating corticosterone
   but findings are mixed and.depend upon numerous contextual factors.
   Here, we determine that the social environment is a key modulator of
   these relationships in Miss musculus. In groups of outbred CD-1 mice
   living in stable dominance hierarchies, we found no evidence of simple
   linear associations betWeen social rank and corticosterone or
   testosterone plasma levels. However, in social hierarchies with highly
   despotic alpha males that socially suppress other group `members,
   testosterone levels in subordinate males were significantly lower than
   in alpha males. In less despotic hierarchies, where all animals engage
   in high rates of competitive interactions, subordinate males had
   significantly elevated testosterone compared to agonistically inhibited
   subordinates from despotic hierarchies. Subordinate males from highly
   despotic hierarchies also had elevated levels of corticosterone compared
   to alpha males. In pair-housed animals, the relationship was the
   opposite, with alpha males exhibiting elevated levels of corticosterone
   compared to subordinate males. Notably, subordinate males living in
   social hierarchies had significantly higher levels of plasma
   corticosterone than pair-housed subordinate males, suggesting that
   living in a large group is a more socially stressful experience for less
   dominant individuals. Our findings demonstrate the importance of
   considering social context when analyzing physiological data related to
   social behavior and using ethologically relevant behavioral paradigms to
   study the complex relationship between hormones and social behavior. (C)

Title = {Distributed resources coordination inside nearly-zero energy buildings
   providing grid voltage support from a symmetrical component perspective},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {208-214},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this work, the authors propose a new coordination method for smart
   distribution networks (SDN) with nearly-zero energy buildings (nZEB).
   The proposed coordination procedure considers a central controller that
   runs a state estimation of the grid and calculates the optimum
   set-points for the buildings. Inside each building, the building
   management system (BMS) manages the converters used by the dispatchable
   generators (DG), the renewable generators (RG) and the energy storage
   system (ESS) to fulfil (as far as possible), the central controller
   request.
   In the paper, the unbalanced behaviour of the grid is considered, so the
   optimum references for the symmetrical component currents in the
   converters are calculated. The proposed method reduces the network
   unbalance and the total losses. In addition, buildings with energy
   surplus can support other neighbours with energy deficit. The present
   paper is focused on how the BMS calculates the optimum references for
   all converters placed inside each building. The main contribution of the
   paper is the use of the symmetrical component approach at building level
   in order to generate the best references for all converters inside the
   building. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Social bonds with males lower the costs of competition for wild female
   Assamese macaques},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {125},
Pages = {51-60},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In polygynandrous mammals, females rarely form affiliative relationships
   with unrelated males outside the mating context. The antiharassment
   hypothesis provides one explanation for why such relationships have
   evolved in some gregarious primates: it states that females receive less
   aggression from group members in the presence of a male partner and gain
   his support when being harassed by others. This lowers the costs of
   competition and increases the female's access to resources, as it also
   reduces interruptions to feeding. Our aim was to test this hypothesis by
   investigating the benefits that wild female Assamese macaques, Macaca
   assamensis, in Thailand derive from bonding with particular males. In
   support of the antiharassment hypothesis, we found that the strength of
   affiliative relationships lowered the aggressiveness of a male towards a
   female, and predicted how much support a female received from a
   particular male in agonistic interactions with other group members.
   Additionally, relationship strength predicted the time that females
   spent co-feeding with a particular male as well as her feeding
   efficiency in the presence of that male. Hence, female Assamese macaques
   benefit from forming a social bond with a particular male by reducing
   the costs of competition. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

Title = {Tooth Enamel Microstructure of Living and Extinct Hyracoids Reveals
   Unique Enamel Types Among Mammals},

Abstract = {Among medium- to large-sized terrestrial `ungulates,' there is often a
   relationship between increasing body size, correlated changes in diet,
   and increased complexity of the enamel microstructures {[}notably the
   development of Hunter-Schreger bands (HSB)]. An exhaustive survey of the
   enamel microstructures of living and extinct Hyracoidea demonstrates,
   however, that the Schmelzmuster within this order of mammals is
   generally one-layered and formed by radial enamel despite a large range
   of body sizes and dietary adaptations; HSB are remarkably absent. Radial
   enamel is characteristic of early diverging hyracoids, as well as more
   derived members of the extinct families Geniohyidae and Pliohyracidae,
   and the extant Procaviidae. Only some large `Saghatheriidae,' and all
   members of the family Titanohyracidae, developed a more complex enamel
   microstructure (i.e., with prisms decussating), a unique condition among
   Mammalia that we name `bundled enamel' (BE). This structure is
   reminiscent to some degree of both the `Pyrotherium enamel' and the `3D
   enamel' of proboscideans. Hyracoids with BE represented a major
   component of the diversity of mid- to large-sized herbivores during the
   Paleogene in Africa. Like HSB, which are developed by most other
   `ungulates,' the BE is regarded as a device for resisting propagation of
   cracks during mastication. Hyracoids never developed however the
   `modified radial enamel' that is characteristic of most large and
   hypsodont perissodactyls and artiodactyls that entered Africa during the
   Miocene.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANATOMY},

Volume = {230},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Species of the extinct genus Hyaenodon were among the largest
   carnivorous mammals from the Late Eocene through Early Miocene in North
   America, Europe and Asia. The origin, phylogeny and palaeobiology of
   Hyaenodonta are still ambiguous. Most previous studies focused on teeth
   and dental function in these highly adapted species, which might be
   influenced by convergent morphologies. The anatomy of the bony labyrinth
   in vertebrates is generally quite conservative and, additionally, was
   used in functional-morphological studies. This study provides the first
   anatomical description of the bony labyrinth of the extinct European
   species Hyaenodon exiguus in comparison to selected extant carnivoran
   taxa discussed from a functional-morphological perspective. Hyaenodon
   exiguus may have occupied a hyaena-like dietary niche with a
   semi-arboreal lifestyle, based on the relative height, width and length
   of the semicircular canals of the inner ear. However, this contradicts
   previous functional-morphological studies focusing on the diameter of
   the canals, which presumably represent the signal of locomotion mode.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Introduction: Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) remain insufficiently documented for the identification of
   accurate diagnostic markers and purposeful target discovery and
   development. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) have important translational value
   given their close phylogenetic relationship to humans and similar
   developmental paths in (neuro)anatomy, physiology, genetics, and neural
   functions, as well as cognition, emotion, and social behavior.
   Areas covered: This review deals with the past and future role of
   NHP-based research in AD pathophysiology, diagnosis and drug discovery,
   and touches upon ethical and legal aspects.
   Expert opinion: Aging NHPs are not complete phenocopies of human AD.
   Conceivably, no other species or experimental model will ever develop
   the full spectrum of AD-typical alterations. Nevertheless, partial - and
   even negative - models can increase knowledge of disease mechanisms.
   Modeling complex brain disorders should not be based on a single model
   or species. Understanding brain diseases relies on knowledge of healthy
   brain functioning, and given their close phylogenetic relationship to
   humans, NHPs serve excellent tools in this respect. NHP-based studies
   remain essential in the development and validation of
   radiopharmaceuticals for early diagnostic imaging biomarkers, as well as
   in the efficacy and safety evaluation of new therapeutic approaches,
   with active immunization or vaccination approaches as front runners.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {We investigated dental homologies, development, and growth in living and
   fossil hyracoids and tested if hyracoids and other mammals show
   correlations between eruption patterns, gestation time, and age at
   maturity. Unlike living species, fossil hyracoids simultaneously possess
   replaced P1 and canine teeth. Fossil species also have shorter crowns,
   an I3/i3, I2, and a hypoconulid on m3. Prenatal specimens of the living
   Procavia capensis and Heterohyrax brucei show up to three tooth buds
   posterior to dI1 and anterior to the seven upper cheek teeth that
   consistently erupt; erupted teeth include an anterior premolar but not a
   canine. Most lower cheek teeth finish eruption during growth in
   hyracoids, not after growth as in most other afrotherians. All hyracoids
   show the m1 at (lower) or near (upper) the beginning of eruption of
   permanent teeth; M3/m3 is the last permanent tooth to erupt. The living
   P. capensis erupts most lower antemolar loci before m2. In contrast,
   fossil hyraxes erupt lower antemolars after m2. Although the early
   eruption of antemolars correlates with increased gestation time and age
   at maturity in primates and Tupaia (i.e., `Schultz's rule'), and
   although modern hyraxes resemble some anthropoid primates in exhibiting
   long gestation and eruption of antemolars at or before molars, eruption
   patterns do not significantly covary with either life history parameter
   among afrotherians sampled so far. However, we do observe a shift in
   eruption timing and crown height in Procavia relative to fossil
   hyracoids, mirroring observations recently made for other ungulate-grade
   mammals.},

Abstract = {We describe two extensions of P systems for the modelling of populations
   and ecosystems. They are the Minimal Probabilistic P systems (MPP
   systems) and the Attributed Probabilistic P systems (APP systems). We
   describe also two case studies in which the two formalisms have been
   applied to the study of real ecological systems. The first case study
   deals with the causes of the stability of European hybrid populations of
   water frogs. The second case study deals with social interactions and
   the establishment of dominance hierarchies in primates.},

Title = {The oldest Cenozoic mammal fauna of Europe: implication of the Hainin
   reference fauna for mammalian evolution and dispersals during the
   Paleocene},

Abstract = {The mammal fauna of Hainin is particularly interesting as the oldest in
   the Cenozoic of Europe, and the earliest reference level (MP1-5) of the
   mammalian biochronological scale for the European Palaeogene. This paper
   summarizes the mammal taxa discovered in the fauna, presents an analysis
   of the fauna as a whole (relative abundance and species richness), and
   describes four new eutherians: Belgoryctes thaleri gen. et sp. nov.,
   Eurolestes dupuisi gen. et sp. nov., Quadratodon sigei gen. et sp. nov.
   and Cingulodon magioncaldai gen. et sp. nov. The assemblage is
   relatively small (about 400 dental specimens), characterized by a high
   diversity and abundance of small insectivorous species and very low
   abundance of plesiadapiforms' and condylarths'. By comparison with
   younger European Paleocene faunas, condylarths' and plesiadapiforms'
   became more and more abundant and diverse through the Paleocene but
   collapsed at the Paleocene-Eocene Boundary. Proteutherians' declined
   steadily, while multituberculates remained diverse, although the early
   Paleocene was populated mainly by Kogaionidae whereas the late Paleocene
   was dominated by Neoplagiaulacidae. The palaeoecology of Hainin is
   deduced from the mammal assemblage: the local environment was likely a
   forested area. Stratigraphically, the Hainin deposits are most likely of
   late Danian age, and biochronologically its fauna represents a partial
   equivalent of the North American Torrejonian Land Mammal Age. When
   compared to younger Paleocene faunas of Europe, the composition of the
   Hainin fauna reveals that a relatively important intercontinental
   dispersal of mammals occurred around the Danian-Selandian boundary,
   roughly corresponding to the Torrejonian-Tiffanian boundary. This
   dispersal is marked by the arrival in Europe of typically North American
   taxa such as arctocyonids, plesiadapids and neoplagiaulacid
   multituberculates. Additional exchanges of lesser magnitude probably
   also occurred around the Selandian-Thanetian boundary (i.e. during the
   Tiffanian), although the evidence is less compelling and mainly concerns
   the plesiadapids Chiromyoides and
   Plesiadapis.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:A240BAE2-7446-4D

Abstract = {In this paper, a decoupled model of a train including an on-board
   accumulation system is presented. The train and the accumulation system
   behaviour is modelled separately and the results are then combined in
   order to study the effect of the whole system over the traction
   electrical network. The model is designed specifically to be used with
   power flow solvers for planning purposes. The validation has been
   carried out comparing the results with other methods previously
   developed and also with experimental measurements. A deep description of
   the power flow solver is beyond the scope of this work, but it must be
   remarked that the model must by used with a solver able to cope with the
   non-linear and non-smooth characteristics of the model.},

   of a static VHF transmitter. After a summary presentation of hyperbolic
   methods, simulations are carried out involving least mean squares
   algorithms to estimate the transmitter position. They underline a
   reduction of the localization error induced by the weighted least mean
   squares algorithm. In a final step, an experimentation on a small scale
   scheme and set up with 9 sensors provides a transmitter localization
   with an accuracy coherent with simulation results.},

Title = {Impending extinction crisis of the world's primates: Why primates matter},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2017},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Nonhuman primates, our closest biological relatives, play important
   roles in the livelihoods, cultures, and religions of many societies and
   offer unique insights into human evolution, biology, behavior, and the
   threat of emerging diseases. They are an essential component of tropical
   biodiversity, contributing to forest regeneration and ecosystem health.
   Current information shows the existence of 504 species in 79 genera
   distributed in the Neotropics, mainland Africa, Madagascar, and Asia.
   Alarmingly, similar to 60\% of primate species are now threatened with
   extinction and similar to 75\% have declining populations. This
   situation is the result of escalating anthropogenic pressures on
   primates and their habitats-mainly global and local market demands,
   leading to extensive habitat loss through the expansion of industrial
   agriculture, large-scale cattle ranching, logging, oil and gas drilling,
   mining, dam building, and the construction of new road networks in
   primate range regions. Other important drivers are increased bushmeat
   hunting and the illegal trade of primates as pets and primate body
   parts, along with emerging threats, such as climate change and
   anthroponotic diseases. Often, these pressures act in synergy,
   exacerbating primate population declines. Given that primate range
   regions overlap extensively with a large, and rapidly growing, human
   population characterized by high levels of poverty, global attention is
   needed immediately to reverse the looming risk of primate extinctions
   and to attend to local human needs in sustainable ways. Raising global
   scientific and public awareness of the plight of the world's primates
   and the costs of their loss to ecosystem health and human society is
   imperative.},

Abstract = {The present work proposes a solution for implementing an isolated gate
   driver for SiC power MOSFETs. The isolation capability, gate switching
   and power transfer to the isolated side features are accomplished by
   using a unique magnetic transformer. To avoid core saturation, the
   original PWM control signal is modulated with a high frequency
   square-waveform. The on and off times are modulated with two different
   amplitude signals, what eventually allows for a full range duty ratio
   operation, including continuous turn-on and off operation. The
   reconstruction of the original PWM signal at the secondary side of the
   driver is also based on simple circuitry. As a consequence, the driver
   based on the proposed scheme results in a very compact solution. This
   enables the integration of the driver in the power cell, therefore
   increasing the achievable power density of the final converter. The
   basic operation of the driver si shown, and the main results on a SiC
   MOSFET based prototype are presented, thus demonstrating the feasibility
   of the driver.},

Abstract = {The present work proposes a solution for an isolated gate driver
   suitable for SiC MOSFETs. The driver is implemented by means of two
   small magnetic transformers, to provide the turn-on and turn-off gate
   signals, as well as the power required for an adequate gate control. The
   operation is based on the modulation of the PWM pulses with a high
   frequency (HF) square-waveform signal. The resulting modulated AC
   waveform is applied to the primary side of the first transformer, and
   reconstructed at the secondary side to obtain the gate driving signal.
   Simultaneously, the HF modulating signal is connected to the primary of
   the second transformer, to provide the required gate drive voltage
   levels and power at the secondary side, ensuring full range duty ratio
   operation. Given that both primary side signals are HF symmetrical
   waveforms, saturation is avoided at both transformers, for any duty
   ratio operation. Therefore, the proposed solution provides galvanic
   isolation for power and gate signal transfer with very small core sizes,
   allowing for an overall size reduction vs. conventional solutions. This
   enables much more compact designs, which are critical in high-power
   density applications and multilevel converters. After describing the
   basic operation, experimental results on a prototype are shown, thus
   demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed solution},

Title = {The Relationship between the (In-)Stability of NORs and Their
   Chromosomal Location: The Example of Cercopithecidae and a Short Review
   of Other Primates},
Journal = {CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Amongst Cercopithecidae, the species of the Cercopithecini tribe
   underwent a very active chromosome evolution, principally by fissions,
   which increased their chromosome number up to 72. In contrast, all the
   species of Papionini have fairly similar karyotypes with 42 chromosomes.
   In animals, nucleolus organizer regions (NORs) are generally considered
   as instable structures, which frequently vary in size, number, and
   location at both infra-and interspecific levels. Although in
   Cercopithecinae the NORs, involved in breaks, exchanges, and
   translocations, behave like fragile sites in somatic cells, their number
   and location appear to be very stable between species. Fluorescence in
   situ hybridization of a 28S rDNA probe on metaphase chromosomes
   displayed a unique interstitial location in either an acrocentric pair
   (in 12 species of Cercopithecini) or a metacentric pair (in 6 species of
   Papionini). A non-exhaustive survey of literature data on NOR location
   in other primates shows that numerical variations of the NORs
   principally depend on their location: most multiple NORs are in terminal
   positions, while almost all unique NORs are in interstitial positions.
   We propose that this correlation is the consequence of the selection
   against gametic imbalances involving the chromosomal material distal to
   the NORs, which is effective when they are interstitially, but not
   terminally, located. Thus, the consequences of the interstitial NOR
   instability for reproduction are essentially limited to their size
   variations, as observed in Cercopithecidae. (C) 2018 S.Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the AC and DC dynamic voltage control in a hybrid
   DC/AC Microgrid (MG) with central and distributed Battery Energy Storage
   Systems (BESSs), applying a power sharing mechanism between the
   different devices in the MG. The MG is composed by a multiport
   transformation center and two fixed frequency 3 phase AC Nanogrids (NGs)
   coupled to a DC bus through 3-phase Power Electronic Converters (PECs).
   The system pursues to minimize the dependence on the utility grid, the
   needed DC capacitance and the stress in the MGs central BESS, while
   increasing the power handling capability and the overall system
   stability during islanding condition. In order to approach the proposed
   aim, two main concerns are studied in this paper: an adaptive power
   sharing mechanism between the DC bus and the AC NGs for DC voltage
   control, and the design and implementation of an AC dynamic local

   amphibians and 32 species of reptiles from the Sahamalaza Peninsula.
   This work increases the total number of amphibian and reptile species

   of species detection, survey effort covered the entire wet season and
   part of the dry season, and utilised a combination of opportunistic
   searching, transect searching, pitfall trapping, and acoustic recording.
   We identified species through an integrative taxonomic approach,
   combining morphological, bio-acoustic and molecular taxonomy. Together,
   this enabled the detection of cryptic and seasonally inactive species
   that were missed in the shorter prior surveys that relied on
   morphological identification alone. The taxonomic identification of
   amphibians utilised a fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene;
   taxonomic identification of reptiles utilised a fragment of the
   mitochondrial COI gene, and when necessary, also mitochondrial fragments
   of the 16S rRNA ND1, ND2, ND4 genes. All sequences were deposited in
   Genbank and COI sequences were also deposited in the BOLD database to
   foster taxonomic identification of malagasy reptiles. We report two new
   taxa: a species of Boophis, since described as B. ankarafensis, and a
   candidate new species of microhylid (genus: Stumpffia). We document
   range expansions of Boophis tsilomaro, Cophyla berara, Blaesodactylus
   ambonihazo beyond their type localities. Along with significant range
   expansions across a range of taxa, including Blommersia sp. Ca05,
   Boophys brachychir, Brookesia minima, Ebenavia inunguis, Geckolepis
   humbloti, Madascincus stumpffi, Pelomedus subrufa and Phelsuma kochi.
   Forest in the peninsula is under extreme pressure from human
   exploitation. Unless unsustainable agricultural and pastoral practices
   encroaching on these habitats halt immediately, both forest and the
   species that occur there, several of which appear to be local endemics,
   may be irreversibly lost.},

Abstract = {A new specimen, referred to the notharctid primate Notharctus

   material consists of the upper and lower jaws with most tooth loci
   represented, including rare representation of relatively unworn upper
   incisors. The completeness of the specimen permits a restoration of the
   spatial relationships of the anterior teeth, demonstrating that there
   was a small zone of interproximal contact between the upper central
   incisors. The relatively unworn upper incisors also indicate a unique
   cropping mechanism in notharctids not seen before in the group. The
   orientation of the cropping edges on the upper central incisors changed
   progressively with tooth wear, implying a shift in function and/or food
   properties over the course of dental senescence. The provenience of the
   specimen highlights the wide geographic distribution of this extinct

Title = {Sociality in Primates},
Booktitle = {COMPARATIVE SOCIAL EVOLUTION},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {253-283},
Abstract = {Primates are a large and diverse order of mammals. They play an
   important role in studies of the evolution of sociality because there is
   considerable diversity in social organization and mating systems across
   the order, and because primates have evolved particularly complex forms
   of social behavior that rely on individual recognition,
   well-differentiated relationships, and well-developed social cognition.
   The first field studies of primates were conducted in the first half of
   the twentieth century by Clarence Ray Carpenter who observed mantled
   howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata, Carpenter, 1934), white-handed
   gibbons (Hylobates lar, Carpenter, 1940) and rhesus monkeys (Macaca
   mulatta, Carpenter, 1942) in their natural habitats. In the 1940s, Kinji
   Imanishi began studying free-ranging macaques (Macaca fuscata) in Japan,
   and developed a set of techniques that would become the foundation of
   future research on wild primates: habituation, individual recognition,
   and long-term studies (Matsuzawa \& McGrew, 2008). In the past 60 years,
   researchers have amassed a large body of information about the social
   behavior and ecology of many of the more than 400 primate species, and
   as a result, today more is known about sociality in primates than in any
   other mammalian order.},

Booktitle = {PRIMATE HEARING AND COMMUNICATION},
Series = {Springer Handbook of Auditory Research},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {63},
Pages = {109-140},
Abstract = {This chapter explores the importance of vocalizations in basal primates
   for modeling the evolutionary origins of primate social communication. A
   rich diversity in acoustic structures and signals, extending into the
   ultrasonic range, is used to govern various ecological and social
   challenges in their networks with varying degrees of social
   cohesiveness. Vocalizations convey information on specific emotions and
   on species, population, group, kin, and individual identity. Comparisons
   within the same phylogenetic group put forth the notion that natural
   selection limits cross-taxa vocal flexibility and favors universals in
   acoustic structure, whereas sexual and kin selection drive divergence.
   Bioacoustic research on vocal ontogeny depicted a babbling period with
   high vocal plasticity and an unexpected capability in adults to adapt
   their vocalizations to fluctuating background noise. Using a comparative
   bioacoustic approach, this chapter illuminates extraordinary cross-taxa
   variation in the acoustic spaces open for signal evolution and reveals
   that predation risk specifically shapes the acoustic space used.
   Comparison of vocal repertoire size, taken as an indicator of vocal
   complexity, reveals wide cross-taxa variation in call types and a
   striking variation in both solitary-ranging nocturnal and group-living
   diurnal species. The phylogenetic hypothesis and the social complexity
   hypothesis cannot fully explain this variation. Altogether, basal
   primates exhibit unique diversity, complexity, and flexibility of
   vocalizations for social communication, providing promising new avenues
   to trace the evolutionary origins of primate communication.},

Abstract = {Due to frequent cases of alveolar echinococcosis (AE) in captive
   primates in Europe, 141 samples of food, which consisting of vegetables
   and fruits, were investigated for contamination with egg-DNA of
   taeniids. Each sample consisted of at least 40 heads of lettuce as well
   as various vegetables and fruits. The samples were purchased at
   different times of the year: either from September to November (autumn),
   originating from greenhouses or fields in the Basel region in the North
   of Switzerland, or in April and May (spring) when fruit and vegetables
   are sourced from throughout Europe from various wholesalers. Each sample
   was washed, and the washing water sieved through mesh apertures of 50 mm
   and 21 mm, respectively. The debris, including taeniid eggs, collected
   on the 21 mm sieve were investigated by a multiplex PCR-analysis
   followed by direct sequencing. In 17 (18\%) of the 95 samples collected
   in autumn, taeniid-DNA was detected (Taenia hydatigena in four, Taenia
   ovis in three, Taenia polyacantha in two and Hydatigera (Taenia)
   taeniaeformis in five cases). Similarly, in 13 (28\%) of the 46 samples
   collected during spring taeniid-DNA was detected (Echinococcus
   granulosus s.l. in two, Taenia crassiceps in one, T.hydatigena in two,
   Taenia multiceps/Taenia serialis in two, Taenia saginata in one and H.
   taeniaeformis in five cases). Although DNA of Echinococcus
   multilocularis was not found specifically in this study, the detection
   of other fox taeniids reveals that vegetables and fruit fed to the
   primates at the Zoo Basel at different times of the year and from
   different origin are contaminated with carnivore's faeces and therefore
   act as a potential source of AE infections. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {Group-level cooperation often poses a social dilemma in which joint
   action may be difficult to achieve. Theoretical models and experimental
   work on humans show that social incentives, such as punishment of
   defectors and rewarding of cooperators, can promote cooperation in
   groups of unrelated individuals. Here, we demonstrate that these
   processes can operate in a non-human animal species, and be used to
   effectively promote the production of a public good. We took advantage
   of the fact that intergroup fights in vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus
   aethiops pygerythrus) are characterized by episodes of intergroup
   aggression with pauses in-between. During pauses, females selectively
   groomed males that had participated in the previous aggressive episode,
   but aggressed male group members that had not. In subsequent (i.e.
   future) episodes, males who had received either aggression or grooming
   participated above their personal base-line level. Therefore,
   female-male aggression and grooming both appear to function as social
   incentives that effectively promote male participation in intergroup
   fights. Importantly, females stood to gain much from recruiting males as
   the probability of winning intergroup fights was dependent on the number
   of active participants, relative to the number of fighters in the
   opposing group. Furthermore, females appear to maximize the benefits

Abstract = {Quantitative aspects of the study of animal and human behaviour are
   increasingly relevant to test hypotheses and find empirical support for
   them. At the same time, photo and video cameras can store a large number
   of video recordings and are often used to monitor the subjects remotely.
   Researchers frequently face the need to code considerable quantities of
   video recordings with relatively flexible software, often constrained by
   species-specific options or exact settings. BORIS is a free, open-source
   and multiplatform standalone program that allows a user-specific coding
   environment to be set for a computer-based review of previously recorded
   videos or live observations. Being open to user-specific settings, the
   program allows a project-based ethogram to be defined that can then be
   shared with collaborators, or can be imported or modified. Projects
   created in BORIS can include a list of observations, and each
   observation may include one or two videos (e.g. simultaneous screening
   of visual stimuli and the subject being tested; recordings from
   different sides of an aquarium). Once the user has set an ethogram,
   including state or point events or both, coding can be performed using
   previously assigned keys on the computer keyboard. BORIS allows
   definition of an unlimited number of events (states/point events) and
   subjects. Once the coding process is completed, the program can extract
   a time-budget or single or grouped observations automatically and
   present an at-a-glance summary of the main behavioural features. The
   observation data and time-budget analysis can be exported in many common
   formats (TSV, CSV, ODF, XLS, SQL and JSON). The observed events can be
   plotted and exported in various graphic formats (SVG, PNG, JPG, TIFF,
   EPS and PDF).},

Title = {Morphological convergence in the pubis of slow-moving primates and
   xenarthrans},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {161},
Number = {3},
Pages = {381-397},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {ObjectivesDetermining the functional significance of pubic rami is
   important for reconstructing locomotor behavior of fossil species. The
   slow loris pelvis, characterized by long pubic rami, is unusual among
   primates. Long pubic rami may be related to increasing the moment arm of
   the abdominal musculature during ventroflexion after the termination of
   hindlimb suspension, which is a common component of slow arboreal
   quadrupedalism (AQ). Some extant xenarthran species are also slow AQ
   taxa, and provide an ideal group to test hypotheses of morphologically
   convergent adaptations to slow AQ.
   Materials and MethodsA model relating abdominal moment arms to pubic
   morphology is tested in three genera of slow-moving xenarthrans
   (Bradypus, Choloepus, and Cyclopes) and two species of slow loris
   (Nycticebus coucang and Perodicticus potto), using a comparative sample
   of 37 species of primates and xenarthrans. Phylogenetic analyses of
   variance and regression were performed on pubic dimensions (superior and
   inferior pubic ramus length, pubic symphysis length).
   ResultsAs a locomotor group, slow-moving xenarthrans and lorises share
   superior pubic rami that are longer than all other locomotor groups; at
   the species level, there is some overlap among slow AQ and non-slow-AQ
   taxa. Inferior pubic ramus and pubic symphysis lengths also differ
   according to locomotor category, but multiple comparisons among
   locomotor groups are non-significant.
   DiscussionThese results support the hypothesis that superior pubic ramus
   length is functionally related to slow, suspensory locomotion by
   increasing the leverage of the ventral abdominal musculature, and
   demonstrates morphological convergence among two phylogenetically
   distant groups of mammals that have evolved adaptations for slow,
   suspensory locomotion.},

Title = {Dietary Supplementation with n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Reduces
   Torpor Use in a Tropical Daily Heterotherm},
Journal = {PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {89},
Number = {6},
Pages = {536-545},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are involved in a variety of
   physiological mechanisms, including heterothermy preparation and
   expression. However, the effects of the two major classes of PUFAs, n-6
   and n-3, can differ substantially. While n-6 PUFAs enhance torpor
   expression, n-3 PUFAs reduce the ability to decrease body temperature.
   This negative impact of n-3 PUFAs has been revealed in temperate
   hibernators only. Yet because tropical heterotherms generally experience
   higher ambient temperature and exhibit higher minimum body temperature
   during heterothermy, they may not be affected as much by PUFAs as their
   temperate counterparts. We tested whether n-3 PUFAs constrain torpor use
   in a tropical daily heterotherm (Microcebus murinus). We expected
   dietary n-3 PUFA supplementation to induce a reduction in torpor use and
   for this effect to appear rapidly given the time required for dietary
   fatty acids to be assimilated into phospholipids. n-3 PUFA
   supplementation reduced torpor use, and its effect appeared in the first
   days of the experiment. Within 2 wk, control animals progressively
   deepened their torpor bouts, whereas supplemented ones never entered
   torpor but rather expressed only constant, shallow reductions in body
   temperature. For the rest of the experiment, the effect of n-3 PUFA
   supplementation on torpor use remained constant through time. Even
   though supplemented animals also started to express torpor, they
   exhibited higher minimum body temperature by 2 degrees-3 degrees C and
   spent two fewer hours in a torpid state per day than control
   individuals, on average. Our study supports the view that a higher
   dietary content in n-3 PUFAs negatively affects torpor use in general,
   not only in cold-acclimated hibernators.},

Title = {Genome sequence of the basal haplorrhine primate Tarsius syrichta

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {Tarsiers are phylogenetically located between the most basal
   strepsirrhines and the most derived anthropoid primates. While they
   share morphological features with both groups, they also possess
   uncommon primate characteristics, rendering their evolutionary history
   somewhat obscure. To investigate the molecular basis of such attributes,
   we present here a new genome assembly of the Philippine tarsier (Tarsius
   syrichta), and provide extended analyses of the genome and detailed
   history of transposable element insertion events. We describe the
   silencing of Alu monomers on the lineage leading to anthropoids, and
   recognize an unexpected abundance of long terminal repeat-derived and
   LINE1-mobilized transposed elements (Tarsius interspersed elements;
   TINEs). For the first time in mammals, we identify a complete
   mitochondrial genome insertion within the nuclear genome, then reveal
   tarsier-specific, positive gene selection and posit population size
   changes over time. The genomic resources and analyses presented here
   will aid efforts to more fully understand the ancient characteristics of
   primate genomes.},

Abstract = {Many wild primates experience long-term limb disability, and their
   ability to cope with disability has implications for survival and
   fitness. We quantified the arboreal feeding and postural behaviors of
   adult chimpanzees to study the consequences of physical limb
   disabilities. We collected behavioral data for a total of 8 mo on
   chimpanzees at Sebitoli, Kibale National Park, Uganda, focusing on the
   time spent feeding, common feeding tree species, body postures, and
   substrate use. Of the 51 chimpanzees we observed, 16 (31\%) exhibited
   limb anomalies, which varied in form and severity. Disabled chimpanzees
   climbed as high as chimpanzees without disabilities and did not differ
   from nondisabled chimpanzees in the amount they used feeding tree
   species. Adult chimpanzees with severe hand disability spent
   significantly more time feeding than nondisabled individuals. In
   addition, manually disabled adults did not suspend themselves from
   branches during feeding as frequently as nondisabled adults and used
   larger substrates for gripping and sitting than nondisabled adults.
   These results indicate that disabled individuals compensate to carry out
   feeding activities in trees.},

Abstract = {We obtained zircon U-Pb ages using LA-ICP-MS for an acidic tuff bed in
   the upper part of the Akasaki Formation, a basal unit of the Eocene
   sequence in the Amakusa area, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. The U-Pb age
   of 49.1 +/- 0.4 Ma (95\% confidence interval) suggests a late early
   Eocene age. Our result is important for biochronological assessment of
   the land mammal fauna of the Akasaki Formation. The new age date
   supports the correlation of the Akasaki mammal fauna with the Bridgerian
   North American Land Mammal Age.},

Abstract = {The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in maintaining the
   health of its host, including human and nonhuman primates. Little is
   known about the intestinal bacterial composition of the Sichuan
   snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana), which has been classified
   as Endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red
   List since 2003. We evaluated the fecal bacterial compositions of 11
   Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys, including six young captive individuals (one
   sample from each), three adult captive individuals (four samples each),
   and two adult provisioned free-ranging individuals (four samples each).
   We also quantified fecal Bacteroides vulgatus, Bifidobacterium spp., and
   Lactobacillus spp., which are defined as probiotics in humans, using
   real-time polymerase chain reaction. We identified five major phyla in
   the collected samples, including Firmicutes (32.4 \%), Bacteroidetes
   (14.7 \%), Verrucomicrobia (8.8 \%), Actinobacteria (4.4 \%), and
   unclassified microbacteria (39.7 \%). Fecal bacteria composition varied
   with age and different seasons. The fecal bacterial composition of the
   captive monkeys was less variable than that of provisioned free-ranging
   monkeys. B. vulgatus amounts were almost 100 times higher in the
   provisioned free-ranging monkeys (10(12)) than in the captive monkeys
   (10(10)). Our results provide an initial catalogue of gut microbiota in
   the Sichuan snub-nosed monkey, which helps to enrich our knowledge of
   gut microbiota in nonhuman primates.},

Title = {Sex differences in contaminant concentrations of fish: a synthesis},
Journal = {BIOLOGY OF SEX DIFFERENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {A comparison of whole-fish polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and total
   mercury (Hg) concentrations in mature males with those in mature females
   may provide insights into sex differences in behavior, metabolism, and
   other physiological processes. In eight species of fish, we observed
   that males exceeded females in whole-fish PCB concentration by 17 to 43
   \%. Based on results from hypothesis testing, we concluded that these
   sex differences were most likely primarily driven by a higher rate of
   energy expenditure, stemming from higher resting metabolic rate (or
   standard metabolic rate (SMR)) and higher swimming activity, in males
   compared with females. A higher rate of energy expenditure led to a
   higher rate of food consumption, which, in turn, resulted in a higher
   rate of PCB accumulation. For two fish species, the growth dilution
   effect also made a substantial contribution to the sex difference in PCB
   concentrations, although the higher energy expenditure rate for males
   was still the primary driver. Hg concentration data were available for
   five of the eight species. For four of these five species, the ratio of
   PCB concentration in males to PCB concentration in females was
   substantially greater than the ratio of Hg concentration in males to Hg
   concentration in females. In sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), a very
   primitive fish, the two ratios were nearly identical. The most plausible
   explanation for this pattern was that certain androgens, such as
   testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone, enhanced Hg-elimination rate in
   males. In contrast, long-term elimination of PCBs is negligible for both
   sexes. According to this explanation, males not only ingest Hg at a
   higher rate than females but also eliminate Hg at a higher rate than
   females, in fish species other than sea lamprey. Male sea lamprey do not
   possess either of the above-specified androgens. These apparent sex
   differences in SMRs, activities, and Hg-elimination rates in teleost
   fishes may also apply, to some degree, to higher vertebrates including
   humans. Our synthesis findings will be useful in (1) developing
   sex-specific bioenergetics models for fish, (2) developing sex-specific
   risk assessment models for exposure of humans and wildlife to
   contaminants, and (3) refining Hg mass balance models for fish and
   higher vertebrates.},

Abstract = {Substantial variation exists in the mechanical properties of foods
   consumed by primate species. This variation is known to influence food
   selection and ingestion among non-human primates, yet no large-scale
   comparative study has examined the relationships between food mechanical
   properties and feeding strategies. Here, we present comparative data on
   the Young's modulus and fracture toughness of natural foods in the diets
   of 31 primate species. We use these data to examine the relationships
   between food mechanical properties and dietary quality, body mass, and
   feeding time. We also examine the relationship between food mechanical
   properties and categorical concepts of diet that are often used to infer
   food mechanical properties.
   We found that traditional dietary categories, such as folivory and
   frugivory, did not faithfully track food mechanical properties.
   Additionally, our estimate of dietary quality was not significantly
   correlated with either toughness or Young's modulus. We found a complex
   relationship among food mechanical properties, body mass, and feeding
   time, with a potential interaction between median toughness and body
   mass. The relationship between mean toughness and feeding time is
   straightforward: feeding time increases as toughness increases. However,
   when considering median toughness, the relationship with feeding time
   may depend upon body mass, such that smaller primates increase their
   feeding time in response to an increase in median dietary toughness,
   whereas larger primates may feed for shorter periods of time as
   toughness increases. Our results emphasize the need for additional
   studies quantifying the mechanical and chemical properties of primate
   diets so that they may be meaningfully compared to research on feeding
   behavior and jaw morphology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Fieldwork conducted in the Wasatch Formation in and around Fossil Butte
   has yielded a diverse assemblage of early Eocene vertebrates. Fossil
   vertebrates are distributed through three discrete stratigraphic
   intervals within the uppermost 180 m of the main body of the Wasatch
   Formation underlying the Green River Formation. These assemblages were
   derived primarily from fluvial overbank mudstone units overprinted with
   variably well-developed paleosols. The lowest (20 m) and highest (60 m)
   sections are characterized by less mature and more hydromorphic
   paleosols, whereas the middle section (100 m) is typified by more mature
   paleosols and more abundant channel sandstones.
   The combined assemblages contain at least 46 species of mammals. Faunal
   characteristics include high abundances of equid perissodactyls and a
   relatively high abundance and diversity of notharctines primates, an
   apparent absence of omomyid primates, relatively high rodent diversity,
   and relatively diverse and abundant artiodactyls. One new genus
   (Eoictops new genus) and three new species (Eoictops novaceki new
   species, Palaeosinopa lacus new species, and ?Notoparamys blochi new
   species) are included in the Fossil Butte assemblage. Also recorded are
   late occurrences of two hyopsodontid condylarths and an early occurrence
   of a rare phenacodontid condylarth. The relatively high abundances of
   equids and notharctines suggest that vertebrate samples were derived
   from relatively open paleohabitats that included forested areas along
   water courses.
   All three assemblages contain characteristic Lysitean (Wasatchian
   biochron Wa-6) elements, but the occurrence of the palaeotheriid
   perissodactyl Lambdotherium in the uppermost horizon indicates a
   Lostcabinian (Wa-7) age for at least the top of the Wasatch Formation.
   The overlying predominantly fish-bearing Fossil Butte Member of the
   Green River Formation also contains Lambdotherium and is therefore Wa-7
   in age as well.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated the timing and duration of hibernation as
   well as body temperature patterns in free-ranging common hamsters
   (Cricetus cricetus) with regard to sex and age differences. Body
   temperature was recorded using subcutaneously implanted data loggers.
   The results demonstrate that although immergence and vernal emergence
   sequences of sex and age groups resembled those of most hibernators,
   particularly adult females delayed hibernation onset until up to early
   January. Thus, in contrast to other hibernators, female common hamsters
   hibernated for shorter periods than males and correspondingly spent less
   time in torpor. These sex differences were absent in juvenile hamsters.
   The period between the termination of hibernation and vernal emergence
   varied among individuals but did not differ between the sex and age
   groups. This period of preemergence euthermy was related to emergence
   body mass: individuals that terminated hibernation earlier in spring and
   had longer euthermic phases prior to emergence started the active season
   in a better condition. In addition, males with longer periods of
   preemergence euthermy had larger testes at emergence. In conclusion,
   females have to rely on sufficient food stores but may adjust the use of
   torpor in relation to the available external energy reserves, whereas
   males show a more pronounced energy-saving strategy by hibernating for
   longer periods. Nonetheless, food caches seem to be important for both
   males and females as indicated by the euthermic preemergence phase and
   the fact that some individuals, mainly yearlings, emerged with a higher
   body mass than shortly before immergence in autumn.},

Abstract = {We assessed the suitability of a frequently used sampling method
   employing cotton swabs for collecting animal body odor for gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs). Our method validation showed that both sampling
   material and sampling protocols affect the outcome of the analyses.
   Thus, among the tested protocols swabs of pure viscose baked before use
   and extracted with hexane had the least blank interferences in GC-MS
   analysis. Most critical for the recovery of VOCs was the handling time:
   the significant recovery losses of volatiles experienced with this
   sampling procedure suggest that a rapid processing of such samples is
   required. In a second part, we used swab sampling to sample the body
   odor of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), which lack scent glands. First
   results after GC-MS analysis of the samples collected from these
   nonhuman primates emphasize that proper analytical performance is an
   indispensable prerequisite for successful automated data evaluation of
   the complex GC-MS profiles. Moreover, the retention times and the nature
   of the identified chemical compounds in our samples suggest that the use
   of swabs is generally more appropriate for collecting semivolatile
   rather than VOCs.},

Title = {Mitochondrial heteroplasmy in vertebrates using ChIP-sequencing data},
Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {Background: Mitochondrial heteroplasmy, the presence of more than one
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variant in a cell or individual, is not as
   uncommon as previously thought. It is mostly due to the high mutation
   rate of the mtDNA and limited repair mechanisms present in the
   mitochondrion. Motivated by mitochondrial diseases, much focus has been
   placed into studying this phenomenon in human samples and in medical
   contexts. To place these results in an evolutionary context and to
   explore general principles of heteroplasmy, we describe an integrated
   cross-species evaluation of heteroplasmy in mammals that exploits
   previously reported NGS data. Focusing on ChIP-seq experiments, we
   developed a novel approach to detect heteroplasmy from the concomitant
   mitochondrial DNA fraction sequenced in these experiments.
   Results: We first demonstrate that the sequencing coverage of mtDNA in
   ChIP-seq experiments is sufficient for heteroplasmy detection. We then
   describe a novel detection method for accurate detection of
   heteroplasmies, which also accounts for the error rate of NGS
   technology. Applying this method to 79 individuals from 16 species
   resulted in 107 heteroplasmic positions present in a total of 45
   individuals. Further analysis revealed that the majority of detected
   heteroplasmies occur in intergenic regions.
   Conclusion: In addition to documenting the prevalence of mtDNA in
   ChIP-seq data, the results of our mitochondrial heteroplasmy detection
   method suggest that mitochondrial heteroplasmies identified across
   vertebrates share similar characteristics as found for human
   heteroplasmies. Although largely consistent with previous studies in
   individual vertebrates, our integrated cross-species analysis provides
   valuable insights into the evolutionary dynamics of mitochondrial
   heteroplasmy.},

Abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this translational review (i.e. moving from
   basic primate research toward possible human applications) was to
   summarize non-human primate literature on anxiety to inform the
   development of future assessments of anxiety in non-verbal individuals
   with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods: Systematic searches of
   databases identified 67 studies that met inclusion criteria. Each study
   was analysed and summarised in terms of (a) strategies used to evoke
   anxiety, (b) non-verbal behavioural indicators of anxiety and (c)
   physiological indicators of anxiety. Results: Eighteen strategies were
   used to evoke anxiety, 48 non-verbal behavioural indicators and 17
   physiological indicators of anxiety were measured. Conclusions: A number
   of the strategies used with non-human primates, if modified carefully,
   could be considered in the ongoing effort to study anxiety in
   individuals with ASD. Potential applications to the assessment of
   anxiety in humans with ASD are discussed.},

Title = {Reproductive endocrine patterns and volatile urinary compounds of
   Arctictis binturong: discovering why bearcats smell like popcorn},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF NATURE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {103},
Number = {5-6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Members of the order Carnivora rely on urinary scent signaling,
   particularly for communicating about reproductive parameters. Here, we
   describe reproductive endocrine patterns in relation to urinary
   olfactory cues in a vulnerable and relatively unknown viverrid-the
   binturong (Arctictis binturong). Female binturongs are larger than and
   dominate males, and both sexes engage in glandular and urinary scent
   marking. Using a large (n= 33), captive population, we collected serum
   samples to measure circulating sex steroids via enzyme immunoassay and
   urine samples to assay volatile chemicals via gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry. Male binturongs had expectedly greater androgen
   concentrations than did females but, more unusually, had equal estrogen
   concentrations, which may be linked to male deference. Males also
   expressed a significantly richer array of volatile chemical compounds
   than did females. A subset of these volatile chemicals resisted decay at
   ambient temperatures, potentially indicating their importance as
   long-lasting semiochemicals. Among these compounds was
   2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP), which is typically produced at high
   temperatures by the Maillard reaction and is likely to be responsible
   for the binturong's characteristic popcorn aroma. 2-AP, the only
   compound expressed by all of the subjects, was found in greater
   abundance in males than females and was significantly and positively
   related to circulating androstenedione concentrations in both sexes.
   This unusual compound may have a more significant role in mammalian
   semiochemistry than previously appreciated. Based on these novel data,
   we suggest that hormonal action and potentially complex chemical
   reactions mediate communication of the binturong's signature scent and
   convey information about sex and reproductive state.},

Abstract = {A slow loris, Nycticebus coucang, was brought to Ji Dong Beom Animal
   Hospital from the National Institute of Ecology due to globe enlargement
   and frequent blepharospasm of the right eye. Ophthalmic diagnoses
   included glaucoma with posterior lens luxation and cataract. Because
   this animal was on exhibition at the National Institute of Ecology,
   preservation of the eyeball by intraocular silicone implantation
   following evisceration rather than enucleation was selected. Before the
   surgery, examination of the normal left eye was performed using Retcam
   and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Three months later,
   the globe size was almost the same as the left eye; however, corneal
   edema remained.},

Abstract = {The U.S. Culture Collection Network was formed in 2012 by a group of
   culture collection scientists and stakeholders in order to continue the
   progress established previously through efforts of an ad hoc group. The
   network is supported by a Research Coordination Network grant from the
   U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and has the goals of promoting
   interaction among collections, encouraging the adoption of best
   practices, and protecting endangered or orphaned collections. After
   prior meetings to discuss best practices, shared data, and synergy with
   genome programs, the network held a meeting at the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture (USDA)-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) National Center
   for Genetic Resources Preservation (NCGRP) in Fort Collins, Colorado in
   October 2015 specifically to discuss collections that are vulnerable
   because of changes in funding programs, or are at risk of loss because
   of retirement or lack of funding. The meeting allowed collection
   curators who had already backed up their resources at the USDA NCGRP to
   visit the site, and brought collection owners, managers, and
   stakeholders together. Eight formal collections have established
   off-site backups with the USDA-ARS, ensuring that key material will be
   preserved for future research. All of the collections with backup at the
   NCGRP are public distributing collections including U.S. NSF-supported
   genetic stock centers, USDA-ARS collections, and university-supported
   collections. Facing the retirement of several pioneering researchers,
   the community discussed the value of preserving personal research
   collections and agreed that a mechanism to preserve these valuable
   collections was essential to any future national culture collection
   system. Additional input from curators of plant and animal collections
   emphasized that collections of every kind face similar challenges in
   developing long-range plans for sustainability.},

Abstract = {The frequency and severity of droughts in certain areas is increasing as
   a consequence of climate change. The associated environmental
   challenges, including high temperatures, low food, and water
   availability, have affected, and will affect, many populations. Our aims
   are to review the behavioral, physiological, and morphological
   adaptations of mammals to arid environments, and to aid researchers and
   nature conservationists about which traits they should study to assess
   whether or not their study species will be able to cope with droughts.
   We provide a suite of traits that should be considered when making
   predictions about species resilience to drought. We define and
   differentiate between general adaptations, specialized adaptations, and
   exaptations, and argue that specialized adaptations are of little
   interest in establishing how nondesert specialists will cope with
   droughts. Attention should be placed on general adaptations of
   semidesert species and assess whether these exist as exaptations in
   nondesert species. We conclude that phenotypic flexibility is the most
   important general adaptation that may promote species resilience. Thus,
   to assess whether a species will be able to cope with increasing
   aridity, it is important to establish the degree of flexibility of
   traits identified in semidesert species that confer a fitness advantage
   under drying conditions.},

Title = {A New Family of Large Omnivorous Bats (Mammalia, Chiroptera) from the

Abstract = {A new fossil from the Late Eocene BQ-2 locality in the Birket Qarun
   Formation in the Fayum Depression of northern Egypt (dated to similar to
   37 mybp) does not fit within the diagnosis of any previously described
   family of bats from Africa or any other continent. Known from a partial
   maxilla, this taxon has dilambdodont tribosphenic molars with a
   well-developed, symmetrical, W-shaped ectoloph lacking a distinct
   mesostyle but with a strong parastyle and shallow U-shaped
   ectoflexus-all traits that are found in most archaic bat families and
   that are probably plesiomorphic for bats. However, this taxon also has
   an M2 with a large metaconule cusp and a large, bulbous hypocone set low
   on the posterolingual corner of the tooth, neither of which occur in any
   known bat family, living or extinct. Also notable is the size of the new
   BQ-2 bat, which appears to have been approximately the same size as the
   largest extant bats with dilambdodont dentitions, falling well within
   the size range of plant-eating megabats and carnivorous bats from
   several extant lineages. The combination of traits in the new BQ-2 bat
   suggests that it was omnivorous, probably including insects, small
   vertebrates, and plant material its diet. In this regard it represents
   an ecological niche previously unknown among archaic Eocene bats, which
   are otherwise thought to have been strictly animalivorous. Because
   extinct Eocene bat families exhibit considerable mosaic evolution in
   morphological traits, do not seem to have inhabited a uniform ecological
   niche, and do not form a monophyletic group, we argue against use of the
   name ``Eochiroptera{''} to collectively refer to these taxa.},

Abstract = {Rates of phenotypic evolution vary widely in nature and these rates may
   often reflect the intensity of natural selection. Here we outline an
   approach for detecting exceptional shifts in the rate of phenotypic
   evolution across phylogenies. We introduce a simple new branch-specific
   metric (V)/(B) that divides observed phenotypic change along a branch
   into two components: (1) that attributable to the background rate ((B)),
   and (2) that attributable to departures from the background rate ((V)).
   Where the amount of expected change derived from variation in the rate
   of morphological evolution doubles that explained by to the background
   rate ((V)/(B)>2), we identify this as positive phenotypic selection. We
   apply our approach to six datasets, finding multiple instances of
   positive selection in each. Our results support the growing appreciation
   that the traditional gradual view of phenotypic evolution is rarely
   upheld, with a more episodic view taking its place. This moves focus
   away from viewing phenotypic evolution as a simple homogeneous process
   and facilitates reconciliation with macroevolutionary interpretations
   from a genetic perspective, paving the way to novel insights into the
   link between genotype and phenotype. The ability to detect positive

Abstract = {ObjectivesFruit husks are rarely uniformly hard, varying in
   penetrability via sulci and changes in thickness. We tested whether a
   hard-food specialist primate i) bites randomly on food fruit husk
   surfaces to access seeds, or ii) selects areas most easily penetrated by
   canines. We consider this would occur so as to minimize deployed
   mechanical force, energetic expenditure and risk of dental breakage when
   feeding.
   MethodsA sulcus is the natural line of weakness where a dehiscent fruit
   breaks open. Using fruits dentally opened for seeds by golden-back
   uacaris (Cacajao ouakary) we: 1) analysed bite mark distribution on
   surface of four fruits types (hard-with-sulcus, soft-with-sulcus,
   hard-no-sulcus, soft-no-sulcus); 2) quantified the force needed to
   penetrate hard and soft fruits at sulci and elsewhere on fruit surface;
   3) measured fruit wall thickness and correlated it with bite-mark
   distribution in all four categories of fruit.
   Results1) Bite marks were distributed at random only on surfaces of soft
   fruits. For other fruits types, bite locations were concentrated at the
   thinnest areas of husk, either over the entire surface (non-sulcate
   fruits), or at sulci (sulcate fruits). 2) For hard-husked fruits, areas
   where uacaris concentrated their bites were significantly easier to
   penetrate than those where they did not.
   ConclusionsThis hard-fruit feeding specialist primate is not biting at
   random on the surface of diet fruits. To access seeds they are focusing
   on those areas requiring less force to penetrate. This may be to save
   energy, to minimize the risk of breaking teeth used in food processing,
   or a combination of both. The study shows, for the first time, the
   subtlety by which these powerfully-jawed animals process their diet
   items. Am J Phys Anthropol 160:113-125, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {ObjectivesGreat ape teeth must remain functional over long lifespans.
   The molars of the most folivorous apes, the mountain gorillas, must
   maintain shearing function for 40+ years while the animals consume large
   quantities of mechanically challenging foods. While other folivorous
   primates experience dental senescence, which compromises their occlusal
   surfaces and affects their reproductive success as they age, it is
   unknown whether dental senescence also occurs in mountain gorillas. In
   this article, we quantified and evaluated how mountain gorilla molars
   change throughout their long lifespans.
   Materials and MethodsWe collected high-resolution replicas of M(1)s
   (n=15), M(2)s (n=13), and M(3)s (n=11) from a cross-sectional sample of
   wild mountain gorilla skeletons from the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in
   age from 4 to 43 years. We employed dental topographic analyses to track
   how aspects of occlusal slope, angularity, relief index, and orientation
   patch count rotated change with age. In addition, we measured the
   relative length of shearing crests in two- and three-dimensions.
   ResultsOcclusal topography was found to decrease, while 2D relative
   shearing crest length increased, and 3D relative crest lengths were
   maintained with age.
   DiscussionOur findings indicate that shearing function is maintained
   throughout the long lifetimes of mountain gorillas. Unlike the dental
   senescence experienced by other folivorous primates, mountain gorillas
   do not appear to possess senesced molars despite their long lifetimes,
   mechanically challenging diets, and decreases in occlusal topography
   with age. Am J Phys Anthropol 160:3-15, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {Insiders represent a major threat to the security of an organization's
   information resources. Previous research has explored the role of
   dispositional and situational factors in promoting compliant behavior,
   but these factors have not been studied together. In this study, we use
   a scenario-based factorial survey approach to identify key dispositional
   and situational factors that lead to information security policy
   violation intentions. We obtained 317 observations from a diverse sample
   of insiders. The results of a general linear mixed model indicate that
   dispositional factors (particularly two personality meta-traits,
   Stability and Plasticity) serve as moderators of the relationships
   between perceptions derived from situational factors and intentions to
   violate information security policy. This study represents the first
   information security study to identify the existence of these two
   meta-traits and their influence on information security policy violation
   intentions. More importantly, this study provides new knowledge of how
   insiders translate perceptions into intentions based on their unique

Abstract = {Mammals use their faces in social interactions more so than any other
   vertebrates. Primates are an extreme among most mammals in their
   complex, direct, lifelong social interactions and their frequent use of
   facial displays is a means of proximate visual communication with
   conspecifics. The available repertoire of facial displays is primarily
   controlled by mimetic musculature, the muscles that move the face. The
   form of these muscles is, in turn, limited by and influenced by
   phylogenetic inertia but here we use examples, both morphological and
   physiological, to illustrate the influence that social variables may
   exert on the evolution and form of mimetic musculature among primates.
   Ecomorphology is concerned with the adaptive responses of morphology to
   various ecological variables such as diet, foliage density, predation
   pressures, and time of day activity. We present evidence that social
   variables also exert selective pressures on morphology, specifically
   using mimetic muscles among primates as an example. Social variables
   include group size, dominance style', and mating systems. We present two
   case studies to illustrate the potential influence of social behavior on
   adaptive morphology of mimetic musculature in primates: (1) gross
   morphology of the mimetic muscles around the external ear in closely
   related species of macaque (Macaca mulatta and Macaca nigra)
   characterized by varying dominance styles and (2) comparative physiology
   of the orbicularis oris muscle among select ape species. This muscle is
   used in both facial displays/expressions and in vocalizations/human
   speech. We present qualitative observations of myosin fiber-type
   distribution in this muscle of siamang (Symphalangus syndactylus),
   chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), and human to demonstrate the potential
   influence of visual and auditory communication on muscle physiology. In
   sum, ecomorphologists should be aware of social selective pressures as
   well as ecological ones, and that observed morphology might reflect a
   compromise between the demands of the physical and the social
   environments.},

Abstract = {Aging is the biological process of declining physiologic function
   associated with increasing mortality rate during advancing age. Humans
   and higher nonhuman primates exhibit unusually longer average life spans
   as compared with mammals of similar body mass. Furthermore, the
   population of humans worldwide is growing older as a result of
   improvements in public health, social services, and health care systems.
   Comparative studies among a wide range of organisms that include
   nonhuman primates contribute greatly to our understanding about the
   basic mechanisms of aging. Based on their genetic and physiologic
   relatedness to humans, nonhuman primates are especially important for
   better understanding processes of aging unique to primates, as well as
   for testing intervention strategies to improve healthy aging and to
   treat diseases and disabilities in older people. Rhesus and cynomolgus
   macaques are the predominant monkeys used in studies on aging, but
   research with lower nonhuman primate species is increasing. One of the
   priority topics of research about aging in nonhuman primates involves

Title = {Antenna selection in a SIMO architecture for HF radio links},
Journal = {RADIO SCIENCE},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This work takes place in the global design of a SIMO architecture
   (single input multiple output) for transhorizon radio links, aiming at a
   significant increase in the data rate when compared with standard modems
   based in general on a SISO scheme (single input single output). The
   project is subject to available space constraints at the receive end,
   involving mobile stations or onboard implementation. We consider
   solutions that appear as extensions of the compact and heterogeneous
   antenna array that we proposed previously: collocated antennas of
   different types are set up with the same phase center and present
   diversity in their polarization sensitivities to make array processing
   effective. Given the number NC of receive channels, we address the
   problem of selecting the most effective antennas in a set of NA possible
   candidates including monopoles, dipoles, loop antennas with various
   geometries, and orientations. The criterion to be maximized is the SIMO
   outage capacity, a quantity based on the statistical distribution of the
   SIMO Shannon capacity estimated for a large number of ionospheric
   channel realizations, each of them being quantified by its channel
   impulse response including the receive antenna directional responses.
   Results are presented in the context of a 1x2 SIMO structure: the
   identification of the two most effective antennas in a set of NA=15
   sensors indicates that the optimal structures involve two orthogonal
   horizontal dipoles or two vertical orthogonal loop antennas. In these
   conditions, the outage capacity reaches up to 2.23bps/Hz, a value that
   significantly exceeds the performances of standard modems.},

Title = {Tooth wear and feeding ecology in mountain gorillas from Volcanoes

Abstract = {ObjectivesEcological factors have a dramatic effect on tooth wear in
   primates, although it remains unclear how individual age contributes to
   functional crown morphology. The aim of this study is to determine how
   age and individual diet are related to tooth wear in wild mountain
   gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) from Volcanoes National Park,
   Rwanda.
   Material and MethodsWe calculated the percent of dentine exposure (PDE)
   for all permanent molars (M1-M3) of known-age mountain gorillas (N=23),
   to test whether PDE varied with age using regression analysis. For each
   molar position, we also performed stepwise multiple linear regression to
   test the effects of age and percentage of time spent feeding on
   different food categories on PDE, for individuals subject to long-term
   observational studies by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International's
   Karisoke Research Center.
   ResultsPDE increased significantly with age for both sexes in all
   molars. Moreover, a significant effect of gritty plant root consumption
   on PDE was found among individuals. Our results support prior reports
   indicating reduced tooth wear in mountain gorillas compared to western
   gorillas, and compared to other known-aged samples of primate taxa from
   forest and savanna habitats.
   DiscussionOur findings corroborate that mountain gorillas present very
   low molar wear, and support the hypothesis that age and the consumption
   of particular food types, namely roots, are significant determinants of
   tooth wear variation in mountain gorillas. Future research should
   characterize the mineral composition of the soil in the Virunga habitat,
   to test the hypothesis that the physical and abrasive properties of
   gritty foods such as roots influence intra- and interspecific patterns
   of tooth wear. Am J Phys Anthropol 159:457-465, 2016. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {Anatomy of male and female external genitalia of adult mice (Mus
   musculus) and broad-footed moles (Scapanus latimanus) was re-examined to
   provide more meaningful anatomical terminology. In the past the perineal
   appendage of male broad-footed moles has been called the penis, while
   the female perineal appendage has been given several terms (e.g.
   clitoris, penile clitoris, peniform clitoris and others). Histological
   examination demonstrates that perineal appendages of male and female
   broadfooted moles are the prepuce, which in both sexes are covered
   externally with a hair-bearing epidermis and lacks erectile bodies. The
   inner preputial epithelium is non-hair-bearing and defines the preputial
   space in both sexes. The penis of broad-footed moles lies deep within
   the preputial space, is an ``internal organ{''} in the resting state and
   contains the penile urethra, os penis, and erectile bodies. The clitoris
   of broad-footed moles is defined by a U-shaped clitoral epithelial
   lamina. Residing within clitoral stroma encompassed by the clitoral
   epithelial lamina is the corpus cavernosum, blood-filled spaces and the
   urethra. External genitalia of male and female mice are anatomically
   similar to that of broad-footed moles with the exception that in female
   mice the clitoris contains a small os clitoridis and lacks defined
   erectile bodies, while male mice have an os penis and a prominent distal
   cartilaginous structure within the male urogenital mating protuberance
   (MUMP). Clitori of female broad-footed moles lack an os clitoridis but
   contain defined erectile bodies, while male moles have an os penis
   similar to the mouse but lack the distal cartilaginous structure. (C)

Abstract = {The use of transgenic models for the study of neurodegenerative diseases
   has made valuable contributions to the field. However, some important

Abstract = {Khasm El-Raqaba (KER) (28.451 degrees N, 31.834 degrees E) is a large
   commercial limestone quarry in Egypt's Eastern Desert. The site is best
   known for cetacean fossils recovered from middle Eocene deposits, but
   remains of some geologically younger, small fossil vertebrates
   representing snakes, rodents and bats, have been recovered from karst
   fissure-fill deposits intrusive into the Eocene limestones. Comparisons
   with extant and extinct material reveal that the KER snakes represent
   two different colubrines, the rodents are referable to the ctenodactylid
   Africanomys, and the bats represent a new species of Hipposideros
   (Pseudorhinolophus). Together, faunal correlation and geological
   evidence are in broad agreement with a late Middle Miocene age for this
   KER fauna, and a palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of mixed subtropical
   and more arid microhabitats.},

Title = {Altered drug susceptibility during host adaptation of a Plasmodium
   falciparum strain in a non-human primate model},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Infections with Plasmodium falciparum, the most pathogenic of the
   Plasmodium species affecting man, have been reduced in part due to
   artemisinin-based combination therapies. However, artemisinin resistant
   parasites have recently emerged in South-East Asia. Novel intervention
   strategies are therefore urgently needed to maintain the current
   momentum for control and elimination of this disease. In the present
   study we characterize the phenotypic and genetic properties of the multi
   drug resistant (MDR) P. falciparum Thai C2A parasite strain in the
   non-human Aotus primate model, and across multiple passages. Aotus
   infections with C2A failed to clear upon oral artesunate and mefloquine
   treatment alone or in combination, and ex vivo drug assays demonstrated
   reduction in drug susceptibility profiles in later Aotus passages.
   Further analysis revealed mutations in the pfcrt and pfdhfr loci and
   increased parasite multiplication rate (PMR) across passages, despite
   elevated pfmdr1 copy number. Altogether our experiments suggest
   alterations in parasite population structure and increased fitness
   during Aotus adaptation. We also present data of early treatment
   failures with an oral artemisinin combination therapy in a
   pre-artemisinin resistant P. falciparum Thai isolate in this animal
   model.},

Title = {Fitness and hormonal correlates of social and ecological stressors of
   female yellow-bellied marmots},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The effects of social and ecological stressors on female reproductive
   success vary among species and, in mammals, previous reviews have
   identified no clear patterns. However, few studies have simultaneously
   examined the relation between social rank and stressors and the
   relationships among rank, stressors and reproductive success. We used a
   long-term data set to study free-living facultatively social
   yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, to isolate the
   relationship between female social dominance rank and faecal
   glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels (our measure of basal stress) in
   adult females. In addition, we examined whether rank and FGM levels were
   associated with reproductive success by quantifying the probability of
   an individual successfully weaning a litter and, for those who did,
   litter size. Highranking females had lower FGM levels and larger
   litters. However, females with the highest FGM levels were significantly
   more likely to wean a litter. Importantly, body condition (as measured
   by previous year's mass) was also positively associated with breeding
   and with weaning larger litters. Thus, although low-ranking females
   probably experienced more social stressors than high-ranking females and
   although adult females often delayed their first reproduction until they
   were of a sufficient mass, our results suggest that elevated baseline
   FGM levels failed to mediate reproductive suppression. Perhaps, in
   species like marmots that have only a single chance per year to
   reproduce, reproductive suppression should be rare. These results
   highlight the importance of social status, body condition and predator
   abundance on determining reproductive success in highly seasonal
   breeders. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {Mandrills are one of the few Old World primates to show scent-marking.
   We combined ethological and chemical approaches to improve our
   understanding of this behavior in 3 zoo-managed groups. We observed the
   olfactory behavior performed by adults and adolescents (N = 39) for 775
   h. We investigated the volatile components of sternal scent-marks using
   gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and compared volatile profiles with
   traits of the signaler. Males marked more than females and within each
   sex the frequency of scent-marking was related to age and dominance
   status, but alpha males scent-marked most frequently and particularly in
   specific areas at the enclosure boundaries. We identified a total of 77
   volatile components of sternal gland secretion, including compounds
   functioning as male sex pheromones in other mammals, in scent-marks
   spontaneously released on filter paper by 27 male and 18 female
   mandrills. We confirmed our previous findings that chemical profiles
   contain information including sex, male age and rank, and we also found
   that odor may encode information about group membership in mandrills.
   Our results support the hypotheses that scent-marking signals the status
   of the dominant male as well as playing territorial functions but also
   suggest that it is part of sociosexual communication.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a versatile spatial scanner Vector Network Analyser
   (VNA) channel sounder for indoor and outdoor scenarios exploiting a four
   axis positioner and optical transposition devices which allow a large
   separation between Tx and Rx antennas. This channel sounder can be used
   over several frequency bands of interest for the development of future
   multi antenna systems. It allows to acquire a large number of static
   channel matrices through a properly sampled region of space in order to
   retrieve the time-varying behaviour of the MIMO channel. A measurement
   run of a 4x8 MIMO channel acquired along a 0.7m translation are
   presented here in order to illustrate the capabilities of the sounder.},

   a newly discovered site near Zallah Oasis in the Sirt Basin of central
   Libya. Based on current knowledge of the associated fauna, this new
   species of Apidium is early Oligocene in age, being roughly
   contemporaneous with faunas from Quarries G and V in the upper part of
   the Jebel Qatrani Formation in Egypt that also contain species of
   Apidium. A phylogenetic analysis based on dental characters indicates
   that the new species of Apidium from Libya is the sister group of
   Apidium phiomense. Apidium bowni and Apidium moustafai from the Jebel
   Qatrani Formation in the Fayum are similar in age to the new species of
   Apidium from Libya, but both of these Egyptian species are more
   distantly related to A. phiomense from younger stratigraphic levels in
   the Fayum. This phylogenetic pattern underscores the benefit of enhanced
   geographic sampling of the fossil record, even in cases where local
   records are thought to be reasonably comprehensive and well documented.
   Oligocene parapithecids can be partitioned into two clades corresponding
   to the subfamilies Parapithecinae (containing Parapithecus and
   Simonsius) and Qatraniinae (including Qatrania and Apidium). Climatic
   deterioration during the early Oligocene may have impacted the
   macroevolutionary dynamics of early Afro-Arabian anthropoids by
   fostering the fragmentation of forest habitats, thereby promoting
   allopatric speciation among widespread populations of Apidium and other
   arboreal taxa. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This work proposes a solution for an isolated gate driver for SiC
   MOSFETs, based on a magnetic transformer that simultaneously provides to
   the secondary side the turn-on and turn-off gate signals and the power
   required for an adequate gate control. This avoids the use of a
   dedicated DC-DC isolated converter and optocoupler. The original pulse
   signal is converted into impulses, avoiding transformer saturation at
   any duty ratio operation. The small size of the resulting transformer
   enables an overall size reduction vs. conventional solutions (based
   either in magnetic or optocoupler + power supply). This enables much
   more compact designs, which are critical in high-power density
   applications and multilevel converters. After describing the basic
   operation of the driver, experimental results on a 2kW prototype
   demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal. It is worth mentioning that
   this design is also suitable for GaN devices with minor design changes},

Abstract = {This work proposes a non-isolated power electronic topology to interface
   two distinct electrical energy storage units to a DC link, resulting in
   a Hybrid Storage System. The proposed solution, called Series-Parallel
   Connection, allows for interfacing these three ports in a simple,
   compact and reliable approach, based on the standard configuration of
   the H-bridge converter. The main advantage is that one of the storage
   units can be of much smaller voltage ratings than the other two,
   avoiding the use of multilevel or galvanic-isolated power stages. The
   resulting structure is compared against the most significant
   transformerless alternatives based on the H-bridge converter, stating
   their advantages and drawbacks. An analysis of the switching and
   conduction losses in the power switches of the proposed solution is
   carried out in order to state the design constraints at which this
   solution presents improved efficiency versus the alternatives. A final
   set of experiments in a 10 kW built prototype demonstrates the
   feasibility and states the benefits as well as the main limitations of
   the proposed scheme.},

Abstract = {This work focuses on the control strategies for different configurations
   of Non-Isolated Hybrid Energy Storage Systems. Basic strategies are
   proposed, studied and compared. Parting from the standard parallel
   connection of bidirectional boost converter in hybrid storage systems, a
   comparison with alternate topologies is presented. These alternative
   schemes overcome the problems that arise in the original configuration
   due the high mismatch in voltage ratings of the individual storage
   systems. A strategy to design the control loops of the resulting Hybrid
   Energy Storage System is proposed, studied, simulated and experimentally
   implemented on a 1.5 kW demonstrator. The control strategy is
   implemented in the standard bidirectional boost converter approach and
   also in the series-parallel connection of the storage units. The
   reported results show how the proposed control strategy applied to the
   series parallel connection presents a good performance in terms of
   dynamic and steady state operation.},

Abstract = {In this work, a Fault Ride-Through control scheme for a non-isolated
   power topology for Hybrid Energy Storage Systems in a DC microgrid is
   presented. The Hybrid System is created from a Lithium-Ion Battery and a
   Supercapacitor Module coordinated to achieve a high-energy and
   high-power storage system; it is connected to a DC link to interface to
   the outer system. The power topology under consideration is based on the
   buck-boost bidirectional converter, and it is controlled through a
   bespoke modulation scheme in order to obtain low losses in nominal
   operation. The operation of the proposed control during a DC link
   short-circuit failure is shown as well as a modification to the standard
   control in order to achieve Fault Ride-Through once the fault is over.
   The operation of the converter is theoretically developed and it is
   verified through simulation and experimental validation.},

Abstract = {This work explores the Series-Parallel Connection of a Low Voltage
   Supercapacitor Module to obtain a Hybrid Energy Storage System for grid
   support applications. The Hybrid System is formed by the Supercapacitor
   Module itself, intended to ensure fast performance upon peak power
   requirements, together with a battery that provides the energy
   requirements. In the full system, the front end converter and the load
   interfacing converter share a common DC link. The battery is connected
   to the DC link by means of a Full-Bridge Current-Source bidirectional
   DC-DC converter. The Supercapacitor Module is connected to the system
   using a Series-Parallel Configuration, which overcomes the main problems
   that arise with the most common topologies found in the literature. The
   full operation of the system has been demonstrated theoretically and by
   simulations. A demonstration of such connection is shown experimentally,
   in a converter operating at reduced power levels, in order to validate
   the feasibility of the system. Conclusions show how this scheme can be
   used in Hybrid Storage Systems.},

Abstract = {Lipofuscin pigment accumulation is among the most prominent markers of
   cellular aging in postmitotic cells. The formation of lipofuscin is
   related to oxidative enzymatic activity and free radical-induced lipid
   peroxidation. In various mammals such as rat, dog, macaque as well as in
   cheirogaleid primates, most of the large neurons, such as cerebellar
   Purkinje cells and neocortical pyramidal cells, show heavy lipofuscin
   accumulation in adulthood. In contrast, a well-known yet poorly studied
   feature of the aging human brain is that although lipofuscin
   accumulation is most marked in large neurons of the cerebral cortex, the
   large neurons of the cerebellar cortex-the Purkinje cells-appear to
   remain free of lipofuscin accumulation. It is however, not known whether
   this characteristic of human Purkinje cells is shared with other
   primates or other mammals. This study reports results from histological
   observation of Purkinje cells in humans, non-human primates, and other
   mammals. Procedures include histochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and
   fluorescence microscopy. Abundant lipofuscin deposition was observed in
   Purkinje cells of all the species we examined except Homo sapiens
   (including Alzheimer's disease cases) and Pan troglodytes. In contrast,
   lipofuscin deposition was observed in neurons of the dentate nucleus.
   Our findings suggest that when compared with other primates, Purkinje
   cells in chimpanzees and humans might share a common aging pattern that
   involves mechanisms for neuroprotection. This observation is important
   when considering animal models of aging.},

Abstract = {Recent work on new anthracothere (Mammalia, Artiodactyla) specimens from
   the Jebel Qatrani Formation, early Oligocene, Fayum, Egypt, has revealed
   the presence of a new genus. Nabotherium new genus is described on the
   basis of a partial skull, several mandibular and maxillary specimens,
   and isolated teeth. The new genus exhibits a distinctive combination of
   features not seen in other Paleogene anthracotheres. The most noticeable
   characteristics of the new genus include the presence of large and
   well-developed upper and lower canines, caniniform third incisors, the
   presence of only a short diastema between the canine and first premolar,
   and broad, bunodont cheek teeth. This is in contrast to other
   contemporary anthracotheres, including other forms from the Fayum, which
   show a spatulate third incisor, a reduced canine, a much longer
   canine-premolar diastema, and more narrow, bunoselenodont cheek teeth.
   The presence of a relatively short rostrum with closely packed incisors,
   low-crowned and simple premolars, and low-crowned, bunodont molars
   indicates that members of the new genus would have been more efficient
   at crushing foods than slicing vegetation, and suggests a more varied
   herbivorous and frugivorous diet than was favored by other, more
   bunoselenodont Fayum anthracotheres.},

Abstract = {Cyanogenic glycosides are naturally occurring compounds and are
   classified as secondary plant metabolites have been produced by many
   plant species. Hydrogen cyanide remains a product of enzymatic
   hydrolysis and thus a matter of concern when consumed fresh or raw.
   Bamboo shoot is one such species which liberates cyanide upon hydrolysis
   of Taxiphyllin. Literature on the toxicity- aspect of bamboo shoots is
   scattered and very few studies report its significance, determination of
   toxic levels and ways to eliminate the toxic content to make it safe for
   consumption. With this background, this paper tries to reflect light on
   the safety aspect of bamboo shoots which cannot be neglected when we say
   bamboo shoots are nutritious vegetables. Therefore compiled and
   comprehensive information has been provided on the cyanogenic content in
   different species of bamboo shoots, fate of metabolism of Taxiphyllin
   and its degradation, health implications of cyanide poisoning and ways
   to eliminate it from shoots.},

Abstract = {Agonism was often associated to an increase in interindividual distances
   in social individuals; however, many evidences indicate that individuals
   affiliate after a The post-agonism behavior of individuals in a captive
   troop of the wedge-capped capuchin monkey was described and conciliatory
   tendency (CT) was estimated by using the PC-MC (Post-Conflict Matched
   Control) method; here PA-MC (PostAgonism Matched-Control). Males
   initiated more agonistic interactions toward females than to other males
   while females avoided initiating them toward males. Interestingly,
   females were more prone to initiate reconciliation than males, both
   toward males (CT: 0.20-0.42) and toward other females (CT: 0.24-0.25).
   Overall, the CT in the group ranged from 0.127 to 0.198. We compared our
   results with those from other capuchins and propose that reconciliation
   may not be fundamental in maintaining social cohesion in Cebidae;
   nonetheless, due to our small sample, this is a preliminary conclusion.},

Title = {Bats (Chiroptera) from Olduvai Gorge, Early Pleistocene, Bed I
   (Tanzania)},
Journal = {AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES},
Year = {2015},
Number = {3846},
Pages = {1-35},
Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania is most famous for producing some of the first
   discoveries of fossil hominins in East Africa. Zinjanthropus (=
   Paranthropus) boisei was initially discovered in 1959 from Olduvai Bed
   I. During screen-washing operations to search for more hominin material
   at Olduvai, an associated faunal assemblage was accumulated including 40
   numbered specimens of fossil bats. Except for seven dental specimens,
   this collection consists entirely of postcrania, almost exclusively
   complete or fragmentary humeri representing both proximal and distal
   ends. Although briefly discussed in preliminary reports, these specimens
   have remained undescribed for over 50 years and have never been
   comprehensively compared to extant species. Our analyses indicate that
   the Olduvai bat fossils represent five families and nine genera, and
   include four new species: Myzopoda africana, n. sp., Cardioderma
   leakeyi, n. sp., Scotoecus olduvensis, n. sp., and Nycticeinops
   serengetiensis, n. sp. The Olduvai bat fossils come from the FLK North 1
   and FLK NN1 levels, both of early Pleistocene age, and ranging between
   1.80 and 1.85 Ma based on Ar-40/Ar-39 dating techniques, respectively.
   Compared to the meager Pleistocene bat record from elsewhere on mainland
   Africa, the Olduvai bat assemblage, although richer, is similar in the
   predominance of vespertilionids. The East African Olduvai bat fauna
   differs from Pleistocene faunas from South Africa in including both
   Myzopoda and Cardioderma but lacking both hipposiderids and
   rhinolophids. These taxonomic differences are likely the result of
   differential sampling due to variation in roosting site preferences
   (cave-dwelling vs. non-cave-dwelling taxa) and foraging habitats (open
   vs. forested) in East and South Africa.},

Abstract = {The ability to distinguish group members from conspecifics living in
   other groups is crucial for gregarious species. Olfaction is known to
   play a major role in group recognition and territorial defense in a wide
   range of mammalian taxa. Although primates have been typically regarded
   as microsmatic (having a poor sense of smell), increasing evidence
   suggests that olfaction may play a greater role in primates' social life
   than previously assumed. In this study, we carried out behavioral
   bioassays using a signaler-receiver paradigm to investigate whether
   rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) can discriminate between body odors of
   female group members and females from different social groups. We
   conducted the study on the research island Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico,
   in the non-mating season and controlled for kinship and familiarity
   using extensive pedigree and demographic data. Our results indicate that
   both males and females inspect out-group odors significantly longer than
   in-group odors. Males licked odors more often than females, and older
   animals licked more often than younger ones. Furthermore, individuals
   tended to place their nose longer towards odors when the odor donor's
   group rank was higher than the rank of their own group. Reuse of odor
   samples decreased odor intensity (rated by human experimenters) during
   the course of a given test day and with longer exposure to ambient air;
   however, the reuse of odor samples did not significantly influence the
   response behaviors. Our findings uncover key roles of olfactory
   communication in a species not possessing distinct scent glands and thus
   shed light into the evolution of primate olfactory communication.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the study was to measure the demands of off-road cycling
   via portable spirometry, leg-power output (PO), heart rate (HR) and
   blood lactate (BLa) concentration. Twenty-four male competitive cyclists
   (age: 29 +/- 7.2 yrs, height: 1.79 +/- 0.05 m, body mass: 70.0 +/- 4.9
   kg, VO2peak: 64.9 +/- 7.5 ml.kg(-1).min(-1)) performed simulated
   mountain bike competitions (COMP) and laboratory tests (LabT). From
   LabT, we determined maximal workload and first and second ventilatory
   thresholds (VT1, VT2). A high-performance athlete (HPA) was used for
   comparison with three groups of subjects with different sport-specific
   performance levels. Load profiles of COMP were also investigated during
   uphill, flat and downhill cycling. During the COMP, athletes achieved a
   mean oxygen uptake (VO2COMP) of 57.0 +/- 6.8 ml.kg(-1).min(-1) vs. 71.1
   ml.kg(-1).min(-1) for the HPA. The POCOMP was 2.66 +/- 0.43 W.kg(-1) and
   3.52 W.kg(-1) for the HPA. POCOMP, VO2COMP and HRCOMP were compared to
   corresponding variables at the VT2 of LabT. LabT variables correlated
   with racing time (RTCOMP) and POCOMP (p < 0.01 to < 0.001; r-0.59 to
   -0.80). The VO2peak (LabT) accounted for 65\% of variance of a single
   COMP test. VO2COMP, POCOMP and also endurance variables measured from
   LabTs were found as important determinants for cross-country
   performance. The high average VO2COMP indicates that a high aerobic
   capacity is a prerequisite for successful COMP. Findings derived from
   respiratory gas measures during COMPs might be useful when designing
   mountain bike specific training.},

Title = {Possible roles of introduced plants for native vertebrate conservation:
   the case of Madagascar},
Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {768-775},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Restoration approaches rely on native plants; yet in some situations,
   natural vegetation may not grow fast enough to prevent the fragmentation
   of original vegetation and the consequent negative impacts on fauna. In
   this context, some introduced plants may grow faster and provide more
   food than native species, and they may also contribute to human
   livelihood. We investigate to what extent introduced plant species (1)
   can serve as habitat and food for endemic vertebrates and (2) provide
   benefits to local people. We address this question in Madagascar,
   characterized by high degrees of endemism, long histories of coevolution
   between endemic species, highly fragmented forests, and a high reliance
   of the rural population on natural resources. A literature search for
   interactions between endemic fauna and introduced flora revealed that
   100 of 1,379 introduced species recorded for Madagascar are used by
   endemic vertebrates. They provide food mainly for primates, flying
   foxes, and birds, and habitat for all terrestrial vertebrate groups. One
   hundred vertebrate species were reported to use introduced plants, many
   of which are fast growing and are useful for populations. Although these
   introduced plants should be approached with caution due to their
   potentially invasive behavior, many introduced plants can provide
   services for the native fauna and for humans. For example, trees can
   provide an interim solution to secure the survival of endemic fauna that
   otherwise would be lost due to fragmentation effects. These plants could
   bridge the time lag until native forest regeneration or restoration with
   native trees will have become effective.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {384-394},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {A stratified paleosol sequence exposed in an open pit mine in central
   Sumatra provides a record of the paleoenvironmental conditions in the
   lower reaches of a large river system in the late Paleogene (latest
   Eocene or Oligocene). Morphological, geochemical, and stable isotope
   data suggest that the sequence represents a mosaic of local
   environmental conditions changing from estuarine to riverine up section.
   Weakly expressed soils formed on low-lying estuary surfaces, while more
   well expressed soils formed on higher, better drained surfaces.
   Peatlands (coal) with clayey subsoils were along the estuary margins.
   Well-expressed soils with evidence of clay translocation and chemical
   weathering become more common higher in the section where alluvial
   deposits associated with a meandering river are dominant. Stable carbon
   isotope ratios support a paleolandscape dominated by C-3 plants with
   input by C-4 vegetation limited to a few intervals. Finally, whole-rock
   geochemistry suggests moderate chemical weathering consistent with a
   tropical locality. This multi-proxy paleoenvironmental reconstruction
   suggests a highly productive lowland forest environment at this locality
   in the late Paleogene and provides the first direct examination of the
   terrestrial environment in Sumatra at this time. The limited fossil
   record in Island Southeast Asia during this time period is likely a
   result of poor bone and shell preservation in tropical forest
   environments combined with a general lack of systematic prospecting.
   However, our continuing work in this area has produced a relatively
   diverse assemblage of fossil vertebrates, now including fishes,
   amphibians, turtles, crocodiles, and mammals, as well as a growing
   diversity of fossil plants. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The rainforest biome of eastern Madagascar is renowned for its
   extraordinary biodiversity and restricted distribution ranges of many
   species, whereas the arid western region of the island is relatively
   species poor. We provide insight into the biogeography of western
   Madagascar by analyzing a multilocus phylogeographic dataset assembled
   for an amphibian, the widespread Malagasy bullfrog, Laliostoma labrosum.
   We find no cryptic species in L. labrosum (maximum 1.1\% pairwise
   genetic distance between individuals in the 16S rRNA gene) attributable
   to considerable gene flow at the regional level as shown by genetic
   admixture in both mtDNA and three nuclear loci, especially in central
   Madagascar. Low breeding site fidelity, viewed as an adaptation to the
   unreliability of standing pools of freshwater in dry and seasonal
   environments, and a ubiquitous distribution within its range may
   underlie overall low genetic differentiation. Moreover, reductions in
   population size associated with periods of high aridity in western
   Madagascar may have purged DNA variation in this species. The mtDNA gene
   tree revealed seven major phylogroups within this species, five of which
   show mostly non-overlapping distributions. The nested positions of the
   northern and central mtDNA phylogroups imply a southwestern origin for
   all extant mtDNA lineages in L. labrosum. The current phylogeography of
   this species and paleo-distributions of major mtDNA lineages suggest
   five potential refugia in northern, western and southwestern Madagascar,
   likely the result of Pleistocene range fragmentation during drier and
   cooler climates. Lineage sorting in mtDNA and nuclear loci highlighted a
   main phylogeographic break between populations north and south of the
   Sambirano region, suggesting a role of the coastal Sambirano rainforest
   as a barrier to gene flow. Paleo-species distribution models and
   dispersal networks suggest that the persistence of some refugial
   populations was mainly determined by high population connectivity
   through space and time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The intracellular transport of organelles, proteins, lipids, and RNA
   along the axon is essential for neuronal function and survival. This
   process, called axonal transport, is mediated by two classes of
   ATP-dependent motors, kinesins, and cytoplasmic dynein, which carry
   their cargoes along microtubule tracks. Protein kinases regulate axonal
   transport through direct phosphorylation of motors, adapter proteins,
   and cargoes, and indirectly through modification of the microtubule
   network. The misregulation of axonal transport by protein kinases has
   been implicated in the pathogenesis of several nervous system disorders.
   Here, we review the role of protein kinases acting directly on axonal
   transport and discuss how their deregulation affects neuronal function,
   paving the way for the exploitation of these enzymes as novel drug
   targets.},

Title = {Epaxial muscle fiber architecture favors enhanced excursion and power in
   the leaper Galago senegalensis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANATOMY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {227},
Number = {4},
Pages = {524-540},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Galago senegalensis is a habitual arboreal leaper that engages in rapid
   spinal extension during push-off. Large muscle excursions and high
   contraction velocities are important components of leaping, and
   experimental studies indicate that during leaping by G.senegalensis,
   peak power is facilitated by elastic storage of energy. To date,
   however, little is known about the functional relationship between
   epaxial muscle fiber architecture and locomotion in leaping primates.
   Here, fiber architecture of select epaxial muscles is compared between
   G.senegalensis (n = 4) and the slow arboreal quadruped,
   Nycticebuscoucang (n = 4). The hypothesis is tested that G.senegalensis
   exhibits architectural features of the epaxial muscles that facilitate
   rapid and powerful spinal extension during the take-off phase of
   leaping. As predicted, G.senegalensis epaxial muscles have relatively
   longer, less pinnate fibers and higher ratios of tendon length-to-fiber
   length, indicating the capacity for generating relatively larger muscle
   excursions, higher whole-muscle contraction velocities, and a greater
   capacity for elastic energy storage. Thus, the relatively longer fibers
   and higher tendon length-to-fiber length ratios can be functionally
   linked to leaping performance in G.senegalensis. It is further predicted
   that G.senegalensis epaxial muscles have relatively smaller
   physiological cross-sectional areas (PCSAs) as a consequence of an
   architectural trade-off between fiber length (excursion) and PCSA
   (force). Contrary to this prediction, there are no species differences
   in relative PCSAs, but the smaller-bodied G.senegalensis trends towards
   relatively larger epaxial muscle mass. These findings suggest that
   relative increase in muscle mass in G.senegalensis is largely
   attributable to longer fibers. The relative increase in erector spinae
   muscle mass may facilitate sagittal flexibility during leaping. The
   similarity between species in relative PCSAs provides empirical support
   for previous work linking osteological features of the vertebral column
   in lorisids with axial stability and reduced muscular effort associated
   with slow, deliberate movements during anti-pronograde locomotion.},

Abstract = {The threatened and poorly known thin-spined porcupine (Chaetomys
   subspinosus) is endemic to the highly deforested central portion of the
   Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil. In southern Bahia, anecdotal
   observations suggested that native forest and shade cacao (Theobroma
   cacao) plantations are important habitats for this species. However, no
   studies have examined habitat preferences. We estimated the home-range
   size and determined the factors influencing habitat selection at
   landscape, home range, and tree scales in the cacao-growing region of
   southern Bahia. Radiotelemetry data from 21 individuals followed for
   3-25 months from April 2005 to November 2013 showed a relatively small
   home range (0.5-9.5 ha using minimum convex polygon methods), with males
   showing larger home ranges than females. Habitat selection was congruent
   across spatial scales, with preference for structurally complex
   environments at all scales. The tagged porcupines preferred trees that
   were large, harboring many lianas, and closer to forest limits. Tree
   selection was specific for each animal activity. On landscape and
   home-range scales, they preferred secondary forest and avoided
   structurally simplified, highly disturbed vegetation types such as shade
   cacao and rubber plantations, early secondary forest, and open areas.
   All these man-modified habitats were rarely used, if at all, which
   considerably reduces the suitable habitat within the core distribution
   area and profoundly impacts conservation. (C) 2015 American Society of

Abstract = {One of the biggest challenges in the manufacturing sector is managing
   product recalls. To date, few studies have explored the role of
   information systems in the recall process. This study presents the six
   Ts of global recall effectiveness as a useful framework for assessing
   the role of information technology (IT) in the recall process. In this
   study, we interview mid-level managers with supply chain management
   experience to capture the richness of this phenomenon. The results offer
   new insights into the value of IT in the recall process. This paper
   contributes to the literature by qualitatively assessing the six Ts
   framework for recall management. We highlight diverse management
   strategies utilised by supply chain stakeholders during the recall
   process. In particular, we discuss important themes that emerged from
   the data analysis. We conclude with a discussion of the research and
   practical implications.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {A new early Eocene bat species is described from the Paris Basin
   locality of Pourcy (Marne), which is thought to represent either MP7
   (early Ypresian; earliest Eocene) or MP8 + 9 (middle Ypresian; later
   early Eocene) in the European Paleogene mammal chronostratigraphic
   scale. It is the first bat described from the Pourcy locality, and one
   of the world's oldest chiropterans. The new bat shares a number of
   archaic dental features found in other early bats, but also exhibits
   several traits that appear derived and suggest referral to the family
   Onychonycteridae. Onychonycterids are restricted to the Ypresian of
   France, Belgium, England, and the USA, and include the most skeletally
   primitive of bats. Onychonycterids lived alongside bats that exhibit
   adaptations for more advanced flight capabilities but which had
   dentitions that were somewhat more similar to those of ancestral
   placental mammals. The new bat species from Pourcy, together with other
   Ypresian chiropterans, illustrates the mosaic nature of bat evolution in
   the early Eocene.},

Title = {Systematics and Phylogeny of Paleocene-Eocene Nyctitheriidae (Mammalia,
   Eulipotyphla?) with Description of a new Species from the Late Paleocene
   of the Clarks Fork Basin, Wyoming, USA},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MAMMALIAN EVOLUTION},

Volume = {22},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Nyctitheriidae is a diverse group of small, insectivorous mammals from
   the Paleogene of Asia, North America, and Europe that have alternately
   been linked to Eulipotyphla (shrews, moles, hedgehogs, solenodons),
   Euarchonta (primates, tree shrews, dermopterans), or Chiroptera (bats).
   Even intrafamilial relationships are poorly understood, resulting in
   ambiguity regarding morphological character polarity critical for
   evaluating supraordinal relationships and paleobiogeographic patterns.
   To help address this issue, we performed a cladistic analysis of 51
   North American, European, and Asian nyctitheriid species, including a
   new nyctitheriid, Plagioctenodon thewisseni sp. nov. from the late
   Paleocene of Wyoming, using 66 characters derived from dental
   morphology. Although the oldest nyctitheriids are found in North
   America, the resulting most-parsimonious cladograms support an Asian
   origin of the family with dispersal into North America by the early
   Paleocene. Among North American and European groups, the subfamilies
   Nyctitheriinae and Amphidozotheriinae, and the genera Leptacodon and
   Saturninia are not monophyletic and require future study and revision.
   The multi-species genera Nyctitherium, Plagioctenodon (including P.
   thewisseni), Plagioctenoides, Cryptotopos, and Euronyctia are found to
   be monophyletic, whereas Wyonycteris is paraphyletic, having Pontifactor
   bestiola nested within it. The earliest known European nyctitheriids
   (Leptacodon nascimentoi, Placentidens lotus, Plagioctenodon
   dormaalensis, Wyonycteris richardi) appear in the early Eocene and are
   each found in an otherwise strictly North American clade consisting of
   either solely Paleocene or a combination of Paleocene and Eocene taxa,
   suggesting at least four earliest Eocene dispersals between North
   America and Europe.},

Title = {Borings in early Eocene turtle shell from the Wasatch Formation, South

Abstract = {Borings in fossil turtle shells collected from the lowermost beds of the
   early Eocene Cathedral Bluffs Tongue of the Wasatch Formation in the
   northwestern part of the Green River Basin near South Pass, Wyoming, are
   herein described. Individual turtle shells in the study area are
   characterized by as few as one or two and as many as >100 borings. The
   borings include both non-penetrative forms (those which do not pass
   fully though the shell) as well as penetrative forms (those which pass
   fully from the exterior to the interior surface of the shell). All
   non-penetrative forms occur on external surfaces of the carapace and
   plastron (i.e. those that would have been accessible while the host
   taxon was alive). Two new ichnogenera and four new ichnospecies are
   established to describe these borings. Karethraichnus (new ichnogenus)
   includes three ichnospecies: K. lakkos (new ichnospecies), K. kulindros
   (new ichnospecies), and K. fiale (new ichnospecies). Karethraichnus
   lakkos are shallow (non-penetrating), hemispherical pits with rounded,
   to flattened bases. Karethraichnus kulindros are deep, non-penetrative
   traces with a cylindrical profile, an axis approximately perpendicular
   to the substrate surface and with rounded to flattened, hemispherical
   termini. Karethraichnus fiale are penetrative traces with a cylindrical
   to bi-convex or flask-shaped profile, and an axis approximately
   perpendicular to the substrate surface. Thatchtelithichnus (new
   ichnogenus) Thatchtelithichnus holmani (new ichnospecies) consist of
   non-penetrative borings into a bone substrate. They consist of a
   ring-shaped trace, with a central pedestal or platform. The position of
   the borings on the shells, and evidence of syn-emplacement healing of
   the borings in several of the turtles, indicates that these borings were
   emplacement by ectoparasites/mesoparasites while the animals were
   living. Similar traces in modern emydid turtles are attributed to ticks,
   leeches, or spirorchid liver flukes.},

Abstract = {Understanding the signals used by plants to attract seed disperses is a
   pervasive quest in evolutionary and sensory biology. Fruit size, colour,
   and odour variation have long been discussed in the controversial
   context of dispersal syndromes targeting olfactory-oriented versus
   visually-oriented foragers. Trade-offs in signal investment could impose
   important physiological constraints on plants, yet have been largely
   ignored. Here, we measure the reflectance and volatile organic compounds
   of a community of Malagasy plants and our results indicate that extant
   plant signals may represent a trade-off between olfactory and chromatic
   signals. Blue pigments are the most visually-effective - blue is a
   colour that is visually salient to all known seed dispersing animals
   within the study system. Additionally, plants with blue-reflecting
   fruits are less odiferous than plants that reflect primarily in other
   regions of the colour spectrum.},

Title = {Can heterothermy facilitate the colonization of new habitats?},
Journal = {MAMMAL REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {117-127},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Increasing evidence shows that torpor in mammals is not only an
   effective adaptation for surviving predictable seasonal harsh conditions
   but is also employed as a response to acute emergency situations. This
   finding leads to the hypothesis that the ability to become heterothermic
   can also facilitate the colonization of new habitats, when mammals have
   to cross unsuitable, fragmented and/or food-scarce landscapes. This
   hypothesis was first suggested in the context of the colonization of
   Madagascar, and it has never been evaluated in detail.In this review,we
   discuss the potential of heterothermy to affect colonization
   possibilities in general and the colonization of Madagascar in
   particular. We list several points supporting the hypothesis and contend
   that, unless colonization eventscoincidentally take place during the
   hibernation period, spontaneous daily torpor is probably more
   instrumental for surviving unexpected and severe conditions on a raft or
   when crossing harsh landscapes than seasonally occurring hibernation. We
   further propose that torpor can positively affect the establishment of a
   founder population by enabling reproductive arrest phases until
   conditions improve. Moreover, if viable offspring are born after
   arrival, this might abolish the absolute necessity of encountering
   individuals of the opposite sex. Altogether, it seems therefore
   consequential that heterothermic mammals with the ability to enter daily
   torpor are the most likely to arrive in a new habitat in a body
   condition that allows successful settlement and reproduction. Together
   with the finding that all recent taxa of terrestrial, non-volant
   Malagasy mammals or their close relatives include representatives that
   use heterothermy, this suggests that torpor might indeed have
   facilitated the colonization of Madagascar.},

Title = {A fossil gourami (Teleostei, Anabantoidei) from probable Eocene deposits

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {ABSTRACT-Fossil fishes were first collected from deposits of the
   Sangkarewang Formation of the Ombilin Basin in Sumatra, Indonesia, in
   the 1870s, but a comprehensive study of these fishes was not published
   until almost 50years later. New material from these deposits was
   collected in 2009, which included a small anabantoid fish. This fish is
   not conspecific with any of the material described previously and is
   here named as a new genus and species. A phylogenetic analysis indicates
   that the new anabantoid is closely related to Osphronemus among the taxa
   studied, and we place it in the family Osphronemidae. However, the new
   fish does not appear to belong to any of the named modern subfamilies,
   so we leave it incertae sedis in the family. Additionally, the
   osphronemid subfamilies are not recovered as a monophyletic group. The
   anabantoid named here and another previously described from the same
   locality are the only fossil anabantoids known. However, the age of the
   Sangkarewang Formation is not confirmed and has been variously
   attributed to Cretaceous, Palaeocene, Eocene, and Miocene, with Eocene
   being the presently favored estimate. Based on the presence of an
   anabantoid in these deposits, an Eocene age is reasonable and is not
   contradicted by the known fish fauna.

Title = {Phylogeny, Paleontology, and Primates: Do Incomplete Fossils Bias the

Abstract = {Paleontological systematics relies heavily on morphological data that
   have undergone decay and fossilization. Here, we apply a heuristic means
   to assess how a fossil's incompleteness detracts from inferring its
   phylogenetic relationships. We compiled a phylogenetic matrix for
   primates and simulated the extinction of living species by deleting an
   extant taxon's molecular data and keeping only those morphological
   characters present in actual fossils. The choice of characters present
   in a given living taxon (the subject) was defined by those present in a
   given fossil (the template). By measuring congruence between a
   well-corroborated phylogeny to those incorporating artificial fossils,
   and by comparing real vs. random character distributions and states, we
   tested the information content of paleontological datasets and
   determined if extinction of a living species leads to bias in phylogeny
   reconstruction. We found a positive correlation between fossil
   completeness and topological congruence. Real fossil templates sampled
   for 36 or more of the 360 available morphological characters (including
   dental) performed significantly better than similarly complete templates
   with random states. Templates dominated by only one partition performed
   worse than templates with randomly sampled characters across partitions.
   The template based on the Eocene primate Darwinius masillae performs
   better than most other templates with a similar number of sampled
   characters, likely due to preservation of data across multiple
   partitions. Our results support the interpretation that Darwinius is
   strepsirhine, not haplorhine, and suggest that paleontological datasets
   are reliable in primate phylogeny reconstruction.},

Abstract = {Stephen D. Miller showed that, assuming the Generalized Riemann

   in the interval 1/2 + it with -t(0) < t < t(0), where to approximate to

   Miller's result does not hold for general L-functions. We show that all

Abstract = {Cystic echinococcosis is endemic in Europe including the United Kingdom.
   However, information on the molecular epidemiology of Echinococcus spp.
   from the United Kingdom is limited. Echinococcus isolates from
   intermediate and definitive animal hosts as well as from human cystic
   echinococcosis cases were analysed to determine species and genotypes
   within these hosts. Echinococcus equinus was identified from horse
   hydatid isolates, cysts retrieved from captive UK mammals and copro-DNA
   of foxhounds and farm dogs. Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.)
   was identified from hydatid cysts of sheep and cattle as well as in DNA
   extracted from farm dog and foxhound faecal samples, and from four human
   cystic echinococcosis isolates, including the first known molecular
   confirmation of E. granulosus s.s. infection in a Welsh sheep farmer.
   Low genetic variability for E. equinus from various hosts and from
   different geographical locations was detected using the mitochondrial
   cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1), indicating the presence of a
   dominant haplotype (EQUK01). In contrast, greater haplotypic variation
   was observed for E. granulosus s.s. cox1 sequences. The haplotype
   network showed a star-shaped network with a centrally placed main
   haplotype (EgUK01) that had been reported from other world regions. (C)

Abstract = {A drug discovery program in search of novel 5-lipoxygenase activating
   protein (FLAP) inhibitors focused on driving a reduction in
   lipophilicity with maintained or increased ligand lipophilic efficiency
   (LLE) compared to previously reported compounds led to the discovery of
   AZD6642 (15b). Introduction of a hydrophilic tetrahydrofuran (THF) ring
   at the stereogenic central carbon atom led to a significant shift in
   physicochemical property space. The structureactivity relationship
   exploration and optimization of DMPK properties leading to this compound
   are described in addition to pharmacokinetic analysis and an
   investigation of the pharmacokinetic (PK)pharmacodynamic (PD)
   relationship based on ex vivo leukotriene B-4 (LTB4) levels in dog.
   AZD6642 shows high specific potency and low lipophilicity, resulting in
   a selective and metabolically stable profile. On the basis of initial
   PK/PD relation measured, a low dose to human was predicted.},

Abstract = {Paleogenetics is an emerging field that resurrects ancestral proteins
   from now-extinct organisms to test, in the laboratory, models of protein
   function based on natural history and Darwinian evolution. Here, we
   resurrect digestive alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH4) from our primate
   ancestors to explore the history of primate-ethanol interactions. The
   evolving catalytic properties of these resurrected enzymes show that our
   ape ancestors gained a digestive dehydrogenase enzyme capable of
   metabolizing ethanol near the time that they began using the forest
   floor, about 10 million y ago. The ADH4 enzyme in our more ancient and
   arboreal ancestors did not efficiently oxidize ethanol. This change
   suggests that exposure to dietary sources of ethanol increased in
   hominids during the early stages of our adaptation to a terrestrial
   lifestyle. Because fruit collected from the forest floor is expected to
   contain higher concentrations of fermenting yeast and ethanol than
   similar fruits hanging on trees, this transition may also be the first
   time our ancestors were exposed to (and adapted to) substantial amounts
   of dietary ethanol.},

Title = {Technical Note: The Effect of Differences in Methodology Among Some

Abstract = {A shearing quotient (SQ) is a way of quantitatively representing the
   Phase I shearing edges on a molar tooth. Ordinary or phylogenetic least
   squares regression is fit to data on log molar length (independent
   variable) and log sum of measured shearing crests (dependent variable).
   The derived linear equation is used to generate an expected' shearing
   crest length from molar length of included individuals or taxa.
   Following conversion of all variables to real space, the expected value
   is subtracted from the observed value for each individual or taxon. The
   result is then divided by the expected value and multiplied by 100. SQs
   have long been the metric of choice for assessing dietary adaptations in
   fossil primates. Not all studies using SQ have used the same tooth
   position or crests, nor have all computed regression equations using the
   same approach. Here we focus on re-analyzing the data of one recent
   study to investigate the magnitude of effects of variation in 1)
   shearing crest inclusion, and 2) details of the regression setup. We
   assess the significance of these effects by the degree to which they
   improve or degrade the association between computed SQs and diet
   categories. Though altering regression parameters for SQ calculation has
   a visible effect on plots, numerous iterations of statistical analyses
   vary surprisingly little in the success of the resulting variables for
   assigning taxa to dietary preference. This is promising for the
   comparability of patterns (if not casewise values) in SQ between
   studies. We suggest that differences in apparent dietary fidelity of
   recent studies are attributable principally to tooth position examined.

Abstract = {The concept of humanitarian technology is growing in popularity due to
   the role of organizations such as food charities that provide food to
   populations with challenges in acquiring food from traditional outlets
   (retail stores, restaurants, etc.). Many food charities receive
   donations from retail outlets looking to donate products that are near
   expiration dates (Jett and Crumbly, 2013). To ensure impoverished
   populations gain access to food with limited dates, food charities
   search for ways to improve the delivery process through the use of
   information technology tools to enhance operational efficiency and
   effectiveness. This paper explores how to improve supply chain
   management in humanitarian organizations, such as food charities, by
   utilizing new service development and task technology fit as the
   theoretical foundation. In particular, it provides the conceptual
   development for an integrated model of social media and supply chain
   management. Results and implications will be discussed at the
   conference. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Ecological factors are known to influence the activity budgets of Yunnan
   snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti). However, little is known about
   how activity budgets vary between age/sex classes, because the species
   is difficult to observe in the wild. This study provides the first
   detailed activity budgets subdivided by age/sex classes based on
   observations of the largest habituated group at Xiangguqing in
   Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve. This study was conducted from June 2008 to
   May 2009. We found that adult females spent more time feeding (44.8\%)
   than adult males (39.5\%), juveniles (39.1\%), and infants (14.2\%).
   Adult males allocated more time to miscellaneous activities (12.5\%)
   than did adult females (3.8\%). Infants were being groomed 6.9\% of the
   time, which was the highest proportion among all age/sex classes. Adults
   spent more time feeding, while immature individuals allocated more time
   to moving and other activities. There are several reasons activity
   budgets may vary by age/sex class: 1) differential reproductive
   investment between males and females; 2) developmental differences among
   the age categories; 3) social relationships between members of different
   age/sex classes, particularly dominance. In addition, group size and
   adult sex ratio may also impact activity budgets. These variations in
   activity budgets among the different age/sex classes may become a
   selective pressure that shapes the development and growth pattern in
   this species.},

Abstract = {Studies of how a mammal's daily energy expenditure scales with its body
   mass suggest that humans, whether Westerners, agro-pastoralists, or
   hunter-gatherers, all have much lower energy expenditures for their body
   mass than other mammals. However, non-human primates also differ from
   other mammals in several life history traits suggestive of low energy
   use. Judging by field metabolic rates of-free-ranging strepsirhine and
   haplorhine primates with different lifestyle-and body mass, estimated
   using doubly labeled water, primates have lower energy expenditure than
   other similar-sized eutherian mammals. Daily energy expenditure in
   humans fell along the regression line of non-human primates. The results
   suggest that thrifty energy use could be an ancient strategy of
   primates. Although physical activity is a major component of energy
   balance, our results suggest a need to revise the basis for establishing
   norms of energy expenditure in modern humans. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {The Ameghinornithidae are an enigmatic group of potentially flightless
   Paleogene birds currently known from three European species. Herein, we
   report a new fossil that represents the first record of an
   ameghinornithid-like bird from Africa. The new specimen was collected
   from the early Oligocene Jebel Qatrani Formation exposed in the Fayum
   Depression of northern Egypt, and may represent the youngest record of
   the clade. The new specimen exhibits many similarities with European
   ameghinornithids, including the absence of an ossified supratendinal
   bridge on the tibiotarsus, a circular lateral condyle of the
   tibiotarsus, and a large medial epicondyle. The Fayum specimen is
   intermediate in size compared to the European ameghinornithids and is
   characterized by the absence of a projection of the medial condyle
   cranial to the lateral condyle and the presence of paired ridges (and
   associated grooves) proximal to the lateral condyle. The occurrence of
   Ameghinornithidae in the early Oligocene of Africa would have
   implications regarding the timing and pattern of biogeographic
   interchanges across the Tethys seaway.},

Abstract = {Trade in primates is considered a major impediment to primate
   conservation globally. The bush-meat trade in West and Central Africa is
   considered largely unsustainable and represents one of the main threats
   to biodiversity. Furthermore, the use of primates in traditional
   practices and medicine includes a third of the African primate species.
   Litle is known about the trade in the African mainland lorisiforms;
   pottos, angwantibos and galagos. Aiming to fill this knowledge gap we
   created an online survey, conducted a literature review, and analyzed
   CITES trade records, focusing on the last two decades. We obtained 188
   questionnaire responses from researchers and people working in 31
   different countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We found a total of 33
   publications reporting on trade in African lorisiforms, and CITES
   records indicate that almost 2000 lorisiforms were traded
   internationally from African range countries. Fifty-three percent of
   respondents provided meaningful details about aspects of the trade in
   African lorisiforms from 50\% of the range countries. Galagose reported
   by respondents in larger numbers than pottos and angwantibos, and mainly
   occurred in the pet trade. Pottos were the most frequently mentioned
   taxon in the literature, when all trade types were combined. Across all
   of the sources (online survey, literature and CITES database), trade in
   pottos and angwantibos was reported from 12 countries, and galagos from
   23 countries. Trade was reported to occur mainly within rural settings
   (64\%), potentially indicating that demand is not high enough to fuel
   long distance trading. However, as seen in the Asian lorisiforms, once
   quantitative studies were conducted, the threat that trade posed became
   alarmingly apparent and is now considered a major impediment to their
   conservation. Our insight into the trade of African lorisiforms should
   be followed up with concerted studies, with an emphasis on quantifying
   trade to the species level.},

Title = {Persistent viremia by a novel parvovirus in a slow loris (Nycticebus

Abstract = {Cancer is one of the leading health concerns for human and animal
   health. Since the tumorigenesis process is not completely understood and
   it is known that some viruses can induce carcinogenesis, it is highly
   important to identify novel oncoviruses and extensively study underlying
   oncogenic mechanisms. Here, we investigated a case of diffuse
   histiocytic sarcoma in a 22 year old slow loris (Nycticebus coucang),
   using a broad spectrum virus discovery technique. A novel parvovirus was
   discovered and the phylogenetic analysis performed on its fully
   sequenced genome demonstrated that it represents the first member of a
   novel genus. The possible causative correlation between this virus and
   the malignancy was further investigated and 20 serum and 61 organ
   samples from 25 animals (N. coucang and N. pygmaeus) were screened for
   the novel virus but only samples collected from the originally infected
   animal were positive. The virus was present in all tested organs
   (intestine, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs) and in all banked serum
   samples collected up to 8 years before death. All attempts to identify a
   latent viral form (integrated or episomal) were unsuccessful and the
   increase of variation in the viral sequences during the years was
   consistent with absence of latency. Since it is well known that parvo
   viruses are dependent on cell division to successfully replicate, we
   hypothesized that the virus could have benefitted from the constantly
   dividing cancer cells and may not have been the cause of the histiocytic
   sarcoma. It is also possible to conjecture that the virus had a role in
   delaying the tumor progression and this report might bring new exciting
   opportunities in recognizing viruses to be used in cancer virotherapy.},

Title = {Low female stress hormone levels are predicted by same- or opposite-sex

Journal = {PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {The social environment can have a powerful impact on an individual's
   stress response and thus affect health and biological fitness. Positive
   social interactions are particularly important for females of species
   living in complex societies, e.g. humans and non-human primates.
   Existing studies have mainly focussed on the effect of same-sex social
   interaction on the stress response, rather than both same- and
   opposite-sex social interaction simultaneously. However, consideration
   of both may be crucial since females may have different `social needs'
   across different life-history stages. Applying the conceptual framework
   of allostasis, we tested the hypothesis that female allostatic load
   (measured through faecal glucocorticoid levels {[}fGCs]), of wild
   seasonally breeding Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis), would
   increase if their social needs were not maintained in accordance with
   season. We found significant seasonal differences in same- and
   opposite-sex sociality which, depending on season, predicted female
   fGCs. In the mating season, females which spent more time close to males
   and more frequently groomed with them exhibited lower fGCs. In the
   non-mating season, when female male interaction was infrequent, positive
   female female sociality predicted lower fGCs. Our results support the
   hypothesis that same- and opposite-sex sociopositive interactions,
   specific to certain life-history stages, can mediate fGCs. We interpret
   this as a consequence of the positive direct and/or indirect effects of
   social contact in accordance with interactions pertaining to a given
   life-history stage, which are likely to impact positively upon fitness.

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {The Fayum Depression of Egypt has produced a great diversity of fossil
   material, including marine and freshwater fishes. In contrast to the
   Eocene formations of the Fayum, the Oligocene Jbel Qatrani Formation has
   been more or less consistently considered to be deposited in a
   freshwater environment; however, the ichthyofauna indicates a more
   complex picture. Cenozoic fishes have been convincingly used to
   interpret the palaeoenvironment in which sediments were deposited. Based
   on the elasmobranch and osteichthyan faunas of the Jbel Qatrani
   Formation, we interpret that this formation was not deposited entirely
   in fresh waters, but had some marine influence, particularly in the
   lower part of the formation. The mixture of freshwater elements, such as
   polypterids and alestids, with brackish and marine elements, including
   myliobatid stingrays, in the Quarry E site suggests a local
   palaeoenvironment that was very close to the shoreline, in a less
   protected area, or under more seasonal influence than the rest of the
   sites in the formation. Additionally, the early Oligocene elasmobranch
   fishes from Quarry E have a strong biogeographic relationship with sites
   in Oman and Pakistan, in the eastern Tethys, representing a restricted
   fauna possibly limited in distribution by cooling global temperatures.},

Abstract = {Effective conservation and management of primates depend on our ability
   to accurately assess and monitor populations through research. Camera
   traps are proving to be useful tools for studying a variety of primate
   species, in diverse and often difficult habitats. Here, we discuss the
   use of camera traps in primatology to survey rare species, assess
   populations, and record behavior. We also discuss methodological
   considerations for primate studies, including camera trap research
   design, inherent biases, and some limitations of camera traps. We
   encourage other primatologists to use transparent and standardized
   methods, and when appropriate to consider using occupancy framework to
   account for imperfect detection, and complementary techniques, e.g.,
   transect counts, interviews, behavioral observation, to ensure accuracy
   of data interpretation. In addition, we address the conservation
   implications of camera trapping, such as using data to inform industry,
   garner public support, and contributing photos to large-scale habitat
   monitoring projects. Camera trap studies such as these are sure to
   advance research and conservation of primate species. Finally, we
   provide commentary on the ethical considerations, e.g., photographs of
   humans and illegal activity, of using camera traps in primate research.
   We believe ethical considerations will be particularly important in
   future primate studies, although this topic has not previously been
   addressed for camera trap use in primatology or any wildlife species.},

   calculated the size of home range and core areas for 18 groups in our
   study area. For the six most intensively studied groups we tested
   whether precipitation as a crude proxy for food availability or group
   size had an influence on range size, assessed the degree of site
   fidelity by quantifying overlaps of annual ranges and core areas, and
   calculated the amount of range overlap between neighboring groups for
   each year. We used the kernel density estimation method to calculate
   home ranges as 90\% kernel and core areas as 50\% kernel. Home range
   size (mean +/- SD) was 6.2 ha (+/- 1.8) and core area size 1.9 (+/-
   0.6). Rainfall and group size were not statistically significant
   predictors of range sizes. Site fidelity was high, with a range overlap
   of 82\% (+/- 11) between consecutive years. Neighboring groups
   overlapped over 48\% (+/- 15) of the outer parts of their group ranges
   and 11\% (+/- 15) of their core areas. We found no evidence that larger
   groups occupy larger areas than smaller groups, suggesting that food
   availability might be above a critical threshold for owl monkeys so that
   larger groups do not need to extend their foraging areas to meet their
   energy requirements. Our findings indicate that ranges remain stable
   over several years as groups visit the same locations of fruit trees
   within their range. We showed that owl monkeys exhibit a considerable
   degree of range overlap. However, we suggest that this range overlap
   might be spatial rather than temporal, which maximizes access to clumped
   feeding resources in overlapping areas that are used at distinct times,
   while excluding other males from access to females in exclusively used
   areas.},

Title = {Discovery of prosimian and afrotherian foamy viruses and potential cross
   species transmissions amidst stable and ancient mammalian co-evolution},
Journal = {RETROVIROLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {11},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Background: Foamy viruses (FVs) are a unique subfamily of retroviruses
   that are widely distributed in mammals. Owing to the availability of
   sequences from diverse mammals coupled with their pattern of
   codivergence with their hosts, FVs have one of the best-understood viral
   evolutionary histories ever documented, estimated to have an ancient
   origin. Nonetheless, our knowledge of some parts of FV evolution,
   notably that of prosimian and afrotherian FVs, is far from complete due
   to the lack of sequence data.
   Results: Here, we report the complete genome of the first extant
   prosimian FV (PSFV) isolated from a lorisiforme galago (PSFVgal), and a
   novel partial endogenous viral element with high sequence similarity to
   FVs, present in the afrotherian Cape golden mole genome (ChrEFV). We
   also further characterize a previously discovered endogenous PSFV
   present in the aye-aye genome (PSFVaye). Using phylogenetic methods and
   available FV sequence data, we show a deep divergence and stable
   co-evolution of FVs in eutherian mammals over 100 million years.
   Nonetheless, we found that the evolutionary histories of bat, aye-aye,
   and New World monkey FVs conflict with the evolutionary histories of
   their hosts. By combining sequence analysis and biogeographical
   knowledge, we propose explanations for these mismatches in FV-host
   evolutionary history.
   Conclusion: Our discovery of ChrEFV has expanded the FV host range to
   cover the whole eutherian clade, and our evolutionary analyses suggest a
   stable mammalian FV-host co-speciation pattern which extends as deep as
   the exafroplacentalian basal diversification. Nonetheless, two possible
   cases of host switching were observed. One was among New World monkey
   FVs, and the other involves PSFVaye and a bat FV which may involve
   cross-species transmission at the level of mammalian orders. Our results
   highlight the value of integrating multiple sources of information to
   elucidate the evolutionary history of viruses, including continental and
   geographical histories, ancestral host locations, in addition to the
   natural history of host and virus.},

Abstract = {We used implanted miniature data loggers to obtain the first
   measurements of body temperature from a free-ranging anthropoid primate.
   Vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) living in a highly seasonal,
   semi-arid environment maintained a lower mean 24-h body temperature in
   winter (34.6 +/- A 0.5 A degrees C) than in summer (36.2 +/- A 0.1 A
   degrees C), and demonstrated increased heterothermy (as indexed by the
   24-h amplitude of their body temperature rhythm) in response to proximal
   environmental stressors. The mean 24-h amplitude of the body temperature
   rhythm in summer (2.5 +/- A 0.1 A degrees C) was lower than that in
   winter (3.2 +/- A 0.4 A degrees C), with the highest amplitude for an
   individual monkey (5.6 A degrees C) recorded in winter. The higher
   amplitude of the body temperature rhythm in winter was a consequence
   primarily of lower 24-h minimum body temperatures during the nocturnal
   phase, when monkeys were inactive. These low minimum body temperatures
   were associated with low black globe temperature (GLMM, beta = 0.046, P
   < 0.001), short photoperiod (beta = 0.010, P < 0.001) and low rainfall
   over the previous 2 months, which we used as a proxy for food
   availability (beta = 0.001, P < 0.001). Despite the lower average winter
   minimum body temperatures, there was no change in the lower modal body
   temperature between winter and summer. Therefore, unlike the regulated
   physiological adjustments proposed for torpor or hibernation, these
   minimum winter body temperatures did not appear to reflect a regulated
   reduction in body temperature. The thermoregulatory plasticity
   nevertheless may have fitness benefits for vervet monkeys.},

Title = {Field evidence for a proximate role of food shortage in the regulation
   of hibernation and daily torpor: a review},

Abstract = {Hibernation and daily torpor (heterothermy) have long been assumed to be
   adaptive responses to seasonal energy shortage. Laboratory studies have
   demonstrated that food shortage alone can trigger the use of
   heterothermy. However, their potential to predict heterothermic
   responses in the wild is limited, and few field studies demonstrate the
   dependence of heterothermy on food availability under natural
   conditions. Thus, the view of heterothermy as an energy saving strategy
   to compensate for food shortage largely remains an untested hypothesis.
   In this paper, we review published evidence on the proximate role of
   food availability in heterothermy regulation by endotherms, and
   emphasize alternative hypotheses that remain to be tested. Most studies
   have relied on correlative evidence. Manipulations of food availability,
   that demonstrate the proximate role of food availability, have been
   conducted in only five free-ranging heterotherms. Several other
   metabolic constraints covary with food availability and can confound its
   effect. Shortage in water availability, the nutritional composition of
   food, or subsequent conversion of food in fat storage all could be
   actual proximate drivers of heterothermy regulation, rather than food
   shortage. Social interactions, competition for food and predation also
   likely modulate the relative strength of food shortage between
   individuals. The ecological relevance of the dependence of heterothermy
   on food availability remains to be assessed in field experiments that
   account for the confounding effects of covarying environmental and
   internal factors.},

Abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to study the welfare of 3 captive
   groups of cotton-top tamarins housed in different zoological parks.
   Ethological observations were conducted during 1 year. In addition,
   fecal samples were collected and the concentrations of glucocorticoids,
   androgens, and progestogens were measured. Within each group, no
   significant differences in fecal cortisol concentrations were found
   between subjects. The fecal concentrations of testosterone and
   progesterone significantly differed depending on the sexes and ages of
   the tamarins. A significant association was found among hormone
   concentrations, exhibit dimensions, and group composition. A highly
   significant correlation was found between all hormones considered and
   the space available for each subject. Significant differences in
   behavioral patterns were observed among groups, including
   social-individual, affiliative-aggressive, and anogenital-suprapubic
   scent marking. Correlations between hormone measurements and behaviors
   were detected. In conclusion, this study confirmed the associations
   between some behaviors exhibited by these nonhuman primates and both
   cortisol and testosterone; these data also highlight the role played by
   progesterone in these behaviors.},

Title = {Chemical signals in the echidna: differences between seasons, sexes,

Abstract = {Seasonally reproducing animals show many behavioural and physiological
   changes during the mating period, including increased signalling for
   mate attraction. Mammals often rely on chemical signals for
   communication and coordination of mating and other social behaviours,
   but our understanding of the subtleties and functions of mammalian
   signalling could be increased with more input from non-model systems. We
   used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and non-parametric statistics
   to investigate the volatile and non-volatile composition of odorous
   secretions in an egg-laying mammal (monotreme), the short-beaked echidna
   Tachyglossus aculeatus. We collected a total of 778 odorant samples from
   69 wild, sexually mature individuals over 3 years at our field site in
   southern Tasmania. Animals were sampled during the breeding and
   non-breeding seasons, as well as during hibernation. Odorants included
   swabs from the cloaca and waxy' secretions from putative scent glands in
   the cloacal wall and at the base of the spurs. Chemical profiles varied
   between different gland secretions and by sex and season. Female spur
   and cloacal wax secretion profiles had higher relative abundances of
   sterols, whereas male wax secretion profiles had more long chain fatty
   acids. Male spur secretions changed significantly during the mating
   season and could function in intra-sexual competition or female mate
   choice. Echidna scent gland secretions also varied between individuals,
   suggesting olfactory cues could be used for individual recognition. Our
   results indicate that echidna secretions contain information that could
   be used by individuals to attract and locate mates during the breeding
   season. We also provide evidence for the potential importance of
   compounds traditionally classified as non-volatile', including sterols
   and fatty acids, as cues for individual recognition or mate assessment.},

Title = {A simple alopecia scoring system for use in colony management of

Abstract = {BackgroundAlopecia in captive primates continues to receive attention
   from animal care personnel and regulatory agencies. However, a method
   that enables personnel to reliably score alopecia over time and under
   various conditions has proven difficult to achieve.
   MethodsThe scoring system developed by the behavioral and veterinary
   staffs at the Washington National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) uses
   the rule of 9s to estimate the percentage of the body affected with
   alopecia (severity) and how the alopecia presents itself (pattern).
   Training and scoring can conveniently be managed using photographic
   images, cage-side observations, and/or physical examinations.
   ResultsPersonnel with varying degrees of experience were quickly trained
   with reliability scores ranging from 0.82 to 0.96 for severity and 0.82
   to 0.89 for pattern using Cohen's .
   ConclusionsThis system allows for reliable and consistent scoring across
   species, sex, age, housing condition, seasons, clinical or behavioral
   treatments, and level of personnel experience.},

Title = {New Density Estimates of a Threatened Sifaka Species ( Propithecus
   coquereli) in Ankarafantsika National Park},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {76},
Number = {6},
Pages = {515-528},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Propithecus coquereli is one of the last sifaka species for which no
   reliable and extensive density estimates are yet available. Despite its
   endangered conservation status {[}IUCN, 2012] and recognition as a
   flagship species of the northwestern dry forests of Madagascar, its
   population in its last main refugium, the Ankarafantsika National Park
   (ANP), is still poorly known. Using line transect distance sampling
   surveys we estimated population density and abundance in the ANP.
   Furthermore, we investigated the effects of road, forest edge, river
   proximity and group size on sighting frequencies, and density estimates.
   We provide here the first population density estimates throughout the
   ANP. We found that density varied greatly among surveyed sites (from 5
   to approximate to 100ind/km(2)) which could result from significant
   (negative) effects of road, and forest edge, and/or a (positive) effect
   of river proximity. Our results also suggest that the population size
   may be approximate to 47,000 individuals in the ANP, hinting that the
   population likely underwent a strong decline in some parts of the Park
   in recent decades, possibly caused by habitat loss from fires and
   charcoal production and by poaching. We suggest community-based
   conservation actions for the largest remaining population of Coquerel's
   sifaka which will (i) maintain forest connectivity; (ii) implement
   alternatives to deforestation through charcoal production, logging, and
   grass fires; (iii) reduce poaching; and (iv) enable long-term monitoring
   of the population in collaboration with local authorities and
   researchers. Am. J. Primatol. 76:515-528, 2014. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {Cognition presents evolutionary research with one of its greatest
   challenges. Cognitive evolution has been explained at the proximate
   level by shifts in absolute and relative brain volume and at the
   ultimate level by differences in social and dietary complexity. However,
   no study has integrated the experimental and phylogenetic approach at
   the scale required to rigorously test these explanations. Instead,
   previous research has largely relied on various measures of brain size
   as proxies for cognitive abilities. We experimentally evaluated these
   major evolutionary explanations by quantitatively comparing the
   cognitive performance of 567 individuals representing 36 species on two
   problem-solving tasks measuring self-control. Phylogenetic analysis
   revealed that absolute brain volume best predicted performance across
   species and accounted for considerably more variance than brain volume
   controlling for body mass. This result corroborates recent advances in
   evolutionary neurobiology and illustrates the cognitive consequences of
   cortical reorganization through increases in brain volume. Within
   primates, dietary breadth but not social group size was a strong
   predictor of species differences in self-control. Our results implicate
   robust evolutionary relationships between dietary breadth, absolute
   brain volume, and self-control. These findings provide a significant
   first step toward quantifying the primate cognitive phenome and
   explaining the process of cognitive evolution.},

Abstract = {Mechanisms governing taxon replacement and subsequent radiation remain
   little understood. We examine possible forcing factors in a turnover of
   subfamily dominance seen within the fossil record of green lacewings
   (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), a common, cosmopolitan, nocturnally active
   insect family. Analyses indicate that Nothochrysinae dominated the
   family in the Eocene, while today they are relictual and the
   cosmopolitan Chrysopinae dominates with > 97\% of its > 1200 species.
   Our findings suggest that this turnover is consistent with two key
   adaptations in the Chrysopinae: a tympanum that detects echolocation
   sounds of bats, which appeared in the fossil record and rapidly radiated
   during this time (a Red Queen interaction), and increased climatic
   tolerance coincident with the onset of post-Eocene global icehouse world
   climate (a Court Jester effect).},

Abstract = {The fossil bats from five riverine and lacustrine localities of the
   Ukraine are described. The biostratigraphic correlations of the examined
   faunas are MN 11 and MN 12 (Early Turolian). Six taxa were identified,
   all belonging to Vespertilionidae. A new species, Pipistrellus semenovi
   nov. sp., close to basal clades of the extant genus, is described from
   Altestovo 5 (MN 12). The records of Pipistrellus from Altestovo 5 and
   Egorovka 1 and 2 (MN 12) are at present the earliest findings of this
   genus in Europe. The Nyctalus sp. from Palievo (MN 11) is one of the
   rarest records of this genus in the Neogene of Europe. The records of
   Vespertilio sp. from Palievo and Egorovka 1 morphologically are similar
   to Recent V. murinus. Recognition of Eptesicus aff. campanensis from
   Novoelizavetovka 3 (MN 12) is, at present, the youngest known record of
   this species. Eptesicus aff. kowalskii from Egorovka 1 and 2 differs
   from the nominotypical taxon in being smaller and in having a less
   reduced m3. The bat assemblages from Turolian localities of the Ukraine
   are most similar to those from Bernardiere, Lobrieu and Dionay (MN 11)
   of France. The peculiar aggregation of bat taxa in the studied
   taphocenosis is consistent with avian pellet origin.},

Title = {Body temperature and thermal environment in a generalized arboreal

Abstract = {Free-ranging primates are confronted with the challenge of maintaining
   an optimal range of body temperatures within a thermally dynamic
   environment that changes daily, seasonally, and annually. While many
   laboratory studies have been conducted on primate thermoregulation, we
   know comparatively little about the thermal pressures primates face in
   their natural, evolutionarily relevant environment. Such knowledge is
   critical to understanding the evolution of thermal adaptations in
   primates and for comparative evaluation of humans' unique thermal
   adaptations. We examined temperature and thermal environment in
   free-ranging, mantled howling monkeys (Alouatta palliata) in a tropical
   dry forest in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. We recorded subcutaneous (T-sc)
   and near-animal ambient temperatures (T-a) from 11 animals over 1586.5
   sample hours during wet and dry seasons. Howlers displayed considerable
   variation in T-sc, which was largely attributable to circadian effects.
   Despite significant seasonal changes in the ambient thermal environment,
   howlers showed relatively little evidence for seasonal changes in T-sc.
   Howlers experienced warm thermal conditions which led to body cooling
   relative to the environment, and plateaus in T-sc at increasingly warm
   T-a. They also frequently faced cool thermal conditions (T-a < T-sc) in
   which T-sc was markedly elevated compared with T-a. These data add to a
   growing body of evidence that non-human primates have more labile body
   temperatures than humans. Our data additionally support a hypothesis
   that, despite inhabiting a dry tropical environment, howling monkeys
   experience both warm and cool thermal pressures. This suggests that
   thermal challenges may be more prevalent for primates than previously
   thought, even for species living in nonextreme thermal environments. Am

Title = {Leaves and fruits of Bauhinia (Leguminosae, Caesalpinioideae, Cercideae)
   from the Oligocene Ningming Formation of Guangxi, South China and their
   biogeographic implications},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {Background: The pantropical genus Bauhinia, along with the northern
   temperate Cercis and several tropical genera, bear bilobate,
   bifoliolate, or sometimes unifoliolate leaves, which constitute the
   tribe Cercideae as sister to the rest of the family Leguminosae based on
   molecular phylogenetics. Hence, the fossil record of Cercideae is
   pivotal to understand the early evolution and biogeographic history of
   legumes.
   Results: Three fossil species of Bauhinia were described from the
   Oligocene Ningming Formation of Guangxi, South China. Bauhinia
   ningmingensis sp. nov. is characterized by its bifoliolate, pulvinate
   leaves bearing basal acrodromous primary veins and brochidodromous
   secondary veins. B. cheniae sp. nov. bears moderately or deeply
   bilobate, pulvinate leaves, with basal actinodromous primary veins and
   eucamptodromous secondary veins. B. larsenii D.X. Zhang et Y.F. Chen
   emend. possesses shallowly or moderately bilobate, pulvinate leaves
   bearing basal actinodromous primary veins and brochidodromous secondary
   veins, as well as elliptic, stipitate, non-winged, and oligo-seeded
   fruits. Meanwhile, previously reported Bauhinia fossils were reviewed,
   and those pre-Oligocene foliage across the world are either questionable
   or have been rejected due to lacking of reliable evidence for their
   pulvini or/and basal actinodromous or acrodromous venations. Besides
   Oligocene leaves and fruits presented here, foliage and/or wood of
   Bauhinia have been documented from the Miocene-Pliocene of Thailand,
   India, Nepal, Uganda, and Ecuador.
   Conclusions: Bauhinia has exhibited a certain diversity with
   bifoliolate- and bilobate-leafed species in a low-latitude
   locality-Ningming since at least the Oligocene, implying that the
   tropical zone of South China may represent one of the centres for early
   diversification of the genus. The reliable macrofossils of Bauhinia and
   Cercis have made their debut in the Eocene-Oligocene floras from mid-low
   latitudes and appeared to lack in the coeval floras at high latitudes,
   implying a possible Tethys Seaway origin and spread of legumes. However,
   detailed scenarios for the historical biogeography of Bauhinia and its
   relatives still need more robust dataset from palaeobotany and molecular
   phylogeny in future research.},

Abstract = {Mammalian extinction worldwide during the Late Pleistocene has been a
   major focus for Quaternary biochronology and paleoecology. These
   extinctions have been variably attributed to the impacts of climate
   change and human interference. However, until relatively recently,
   research has been largely restricted to the Americas, Europe, and
   Australasia. We present the oldest Middle-Late Pleistocene stratified
   and numerically dated faunal succession for the Indian subcontinent from
   the Billasurgam cave complex. Our data demonstrate continuity of 20 of
   21 identified mammalian taxa from at least 100,000 y ago to the present,
   and in some cases up to 200,000 y ago. Comparison of this fossil record
   to contemporary faunal ranges indicates some geographical redistribution
   of mammalian taxa within India. We suggest that, although local
   extirpations occurred, the majority of taxa survived or adapted to
   substantial ecological pressures in fragmented habitats. Comparison of
   the Indian record with faunal records from Southeast and Southwest Asia
   demonstrates the importance of interconnected mosaic habitats to
   long-term faunal persistence across the Asian tropics. The data
   presented here have implications for mammalian conservation in India
   today, where increasing ecological circumscription may leave certain
   taxa increasingly endangered in the most densely populated region of the
   world.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Month = {APR 14},
Abstract = {Tooth wear in primates is caused by aging and ecological factors.
   However, comparative data that would allow us to delineate the
   contribution of each of these factors are lacking. Here, we contrast
   age-dependent molar tooth wear by scoring percent of dentine exposure
   (PDE) in two wild African primate populations from Gabonese forest and
   Kenyan savanna habitats. We found that forest-dwelling mandrills
   exhibited significantly higher PDE with age than savanna yellow baboons.
   Mandrills mainly feed on large tough food items, such as hard-shell
   fruits, and inhabit an ecosystem with a high presence of mineral quartz.
   By contrast, baboons consume large amounts of exogenous grit that
   adheres to underground storage organs but the proportion of quartz in
   the soils where baboons live is low. Our results support the hypothesis
   that not only age but also physical food properties and soil
   composition, particularly quartz richness, are factors that
   significantly impact tooth wear. We further propose that the accelerated
   dental wear in mandrills resulting in flatter molars with old age may
   represent an adaptation to process hard food items present in their
   environment.},

Abstract = {Habitat fragmentation is one of the most prominent effects of
   anthropogenic ecosystem degradation. However, despite the accumulating
   evidence that anthropogenic habitat fragmentation acts negatively on the
   dynamics and viability of many species, rainforest fragmentation can
   occur naturally. The need to disentangle `natural' fragmentation
   processes from (often) very recent anthropogenic effects poses a
   methodological challenge in the field of conservation genetics.
   Additional challenges include sampling schemes that can generate false
   signals of population size changes or population genetic structure.
   Finally, limited analytical power often results from restricted sample
   sizes, numbers of markers, or their informativeness. We reviewed the
   available literature on the effects of habitat fragmentation in
   non-aquatic tropical animal species over the last 10 years to ask what
   has been learned as a result of the increasing attention paid to these
   methodological issues. Fifty-four studies contained relevant datasets on
   the question of fragmentation effects in 74 animal species. Primates (n
   = 18) and passerine birds (n = 17) contributed most species to the
   survey. Unambiguous signals of fragmentation effects were reported in
   33.8 \% of species, whereas the remaining species showed either
   equivocal (36.5 \%) or no evidence (29.7 \%) of fragmentation effects.
   Our review further reveals that uneven sampling cannot be ruled out as
   possible explanation for many of the reported genetic bottleneck signals
   and genetic structure effects. Based on the reviewed evidence,
   methodological (e. g. improving sampling schemes, multiple analytical
   approaches, added value of different markers) and conceptual
   recommendations offering a better understanding of general and
   species-specific evolutionary responses to fragmentation are formulated
   for future studies.},

Abstract = {Electronic Government (e-government) is growing in popularity across the
   globe. Given the increasing relevance of electronic services in the
   public sector, there is a need for a global agreement on a consistent
   framework for assessing e-government. This study uses a cross-cultural
   comparison to assess the fundamentals of e-government adoption in the
   United States (USA) and Spain. In particular, the authors explore the
   effects of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, compatibility
   and trust on intentions to use e-government services. A survey was
   administered to citizens in both countries to test the hypotheses
   derived from adoption literature and Hofstede's dimensions of culture.
   Results indicate that there are differences in the relationship between
   compatibility and use intention, with stronger effects in the USA
   sample. Furthermore, while perceived ease of use significantly impacts
   intentions for the USA sample, it does not for the Spain sample; and,
   while trust is not significant in the USA sample, it is for the Spain
   sample. The implications of these results, mostly consistent with the
   hypotheses as suggested by the dimensions of culture, are discussed for
   both research and practice.},

Title = {A Comparison of Body Size, Coat Condition and Endoparasite Diversity of
   Wild Barbary Macaques Exposed to Different Levels of Tourism},

Abstract = {Primate tourism is a rapidly growing industry with the potential to
   provide considerable conservation benefits. However, assessing the
   impact of tourists on the animals involved is vital to ensure that the
   conservation value of primate tourism is maximized. In this study, we
   compared body size, coat condition, and endoparasite diversity of wild,
   adult Barbary macaques exposed to different levels of tourism. Study
   animals belonged to three groups located in the Middle Atlas Mountains,
   Morocco: ``green group{''} (GG) and ``scarlet group{''} (SG) were
   exposed to negligible/no tourism, while the ``tourist group{''} (TG) was
   exposed to very high levels of tourism. We used photogrammetry to
   quantify body size, scored coat condition from photographs, and
   quantified endoparasite species number from fecal samples. For both
   males and females, TG animals had deeper stomachs and wider hips than SG
   and GG animals. The coat condition of TG males was worse than that of SG
   and GG males, but no difference between groups was seen for females.
   Fecal samples from TG males contained a greater mean number of protozoan
   species than did samples from SG and GG males; for females a similar
   difference was found between TG and GG, but not between TG and SG. This
   study provides evidence that tourism has impacts on the body size, coat
   condition, and endoparasite diversity of Barbary macaques at this site.
   Further study is required to assess whether such effects are detrimental
   to the health of these animals.},

Title = {Social consequences of disability in a nonhuman primate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {68},
Pages = {47-57},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Debates about the likelihood of conspecific care for disabled
   individuals in ancestral hominins rely on evidence from extant primates,
   yet little is known about social treatment (positive, neutral or
   negative) of physically disabled individuals in nonhuman primates. A
   group of free-ranging Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) at the
   Awajishima Monkey Center (AMC) in Japan presents a unique opportunity to
   investigate the relationships between physical impairment and social
   behavior, in the context of congenital limb malformation in adult
   nonhuman primates. We collected behavioral data on 23 focal animals,
   taking 30-minute continuous time samples on disabled and nondisabled
   adult female Japanese macaques during three consecutive birth seasons
   (May August 2005, 2006, and 2007). Disabled females were less social
   overall compared with nondisabled controls, a pattern that was evident
   from a variety of measures. Disabled females rested significantly more
   and socialized significantly less compared with controls, had fewer
   adult female affiliates, fewer adult female grooming partners, and spent
   less time engaged in grooming with adult females. Some measures
   suggested that the social differences were the result of behavioral
   flexibility on the part of disabled females compensating for their
   disabilities with lower levels of social involvement and more rest.
   Disabled females were as successful at groom solicitations as were
   nondisabled females and the ratio of disabled and nondisabled affiliates
   was similar among focal animals; there was no strong preference related
   to the disability status of affiliates. Disabled females were also
   bitten and chased less frequently. Overall, there was little evidence
   either for conspecific care or for social selection against disability.
   In general, there was a socially neutral response to disability, and
   while neutral social context allows for the possibility of care
   behaviors, our findings emphasize the self-reliant abilities of these
   disabled primates and suggest caution when inferring conspecific care
   for even very disabled ancestral humans. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {New Myzopodidae (Chiroptera) from the Late Paleogene of Egypt: Emended
   Family Diagnosis and Biogeographic Origins of Noctilionoidea},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 4},
Abstract = {Myzopodidae is a family of bats today represented by two extant species
   of the genus Myzopoda that are restricted to the island of Madagascar.
   These bats possess uniquely derived adhesive pads on their thumbs and
   ankles that they use for clinging to smooth roosting surfaces. Only one
   fossil myzopodid has been reported previously, a humerus from
   Pleistocene deposits at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania that was tentatively
   referred to the genus Myzopoda. Here we describe a new genus and two new
   species of myzopodids based on dental remains from Paleogene deposits in
   the Fayum Depression in Egypt, and provide an emended diagnosis for the
   family Myzopodidae. Phasmatonycteris phiomensis n. sp. is represented by
   four specimens from the early Oligocene Jebel Qatrani Formation and P.
   butleri n. sp. is known from a single specimen from the late Eocene
   Birket Qarun Formation. Together these specimens extend the temporal
   range of Myzopodidae by 36+ million years, and the geographic range by
   nearly 4000 kilometers. The new myzopodids, along with previously
   described bats from the Fayum and Australia, suggest that eastern
   Gondwana played a critical role in the origin and diversification of
   several bats clades notably including the superfamily Noctilionoidea,
   the majority of which live in the Neotropics today.},

Abstract = {Madapolystoma ramilijaonae n. sp. and Madapolystoma cryptica n. sp.
   (Monogenea, Polystomatidae) are described from the urinary bladder of
   disjunct populations of the Madagascar shrub frog Guibemantis liber.
   Although only minor morphological characters distinguish the new species
   from the single nominal species of the genus, i.e. Madapolystoma
   biritika, their strong and concordant differentiation in a mitochondrial
   and a nuclear gene supplemented by phylogenetic analyses indicates that
   M. ramilijaonae n. sp. and M. cyptica n. sp. should be regarded as two
   distinct species. Because anuran polystomes are known to be
   host-specific, the description of two cryptic species from a single host
   species points to a taxonomic complex situation in G. liber, a
   widespread frog that is characterized by the presence of several deep
   conspecific lineages and possibly by hybridization and admixture with
   other species of Guibemantis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Since the serendipitous discovery of the effect of the major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) on mate choice in laboratory mice
   nearly 40 yr ago, there has been sustained interest in the role that MHC
   genes may play in vertebrate sexual behavior. However, the challenges
   posed by MHC genotyping have long hampered progress in this area. We
   briefly introduce the documented links between MHC and behavior, before
   presenting an overview of the genotyping methods that were available
   before the introduction of new sequencing technologies. We then clarify
   why next-generation sequencing represents a major breakthrough in MHC
   genotyping by reviewing the recent successes -and pitfalls- of pioneer
   studies applying these techniques, before envisioning their
   revolutionary implications for future MHC studies in evolutionary
   ecology and primatology. We hope that our practical guidance to the
   design of MHC-based projects will promote and facilitate the integration
   of a MHC component into the research agendas of primatologists.},

Abstract = {Recent technological advances have dramatically reduced the cost of DNA
   sequencing. In addition, these methods require lower DNA quantities and
   qualities than did the previous generation of molecular techniques. As a
   result, genomic-scale studies of natural populations of endangered
   species, including those using noninvasively collected samples, are
   increasingly feasible. Such studies have the potential to advance our
   understanding of behavior, demography, evolutionary ecology,
   biogeography, and population history, and to contribute to the
   prioritization of conservation efforts. I point to a number of salient
   examples. However, there are also some current limitations and
   challenges associated with this scale of population genomics research in
   nonhuman, nonmodel species. Here, I describe the practicalities of the
   present state of this research while providing what is intended to be a
   straightforward walkthrough of the technology and methods involved.},

Title = {Inbreeding Avoidance in Male Primates: A Response to Female Mate Choice?},
Journal = {ETHOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {120},
Number = {2},
Pages = {111-119},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Inbreeding often has negative fitness consequences for primates, which
   have led to the evolution of inbreeding avoidance strategies in a number
   of species. In polygynous primates, females may suffer a higher fitness
   cost from inbreeding than males and are thus expected to exhibit a lower
   tolerance for inbreeding. Nevertheless, it is apparent that inbreeding
   avoidance behaviours are common in both female and male polygynous
   primates. In this perspectives article, I review the evidence that
   female mate choice can lead to male inbreeding avoidance behaviours in
   polygynous primates. I conclude that male inbreeding avoidance may be
   strongly driven by female mate choice at both proximate and ultimate
   levels. To better understand the extent to which this pattern applies
   across the primate order, studies are needed on the separate effects of
   participating in inbred matings and producing inbred offspring on male
   and female lifetime reproductive success. It would also be useful to
   examine how inbreeding avoidance strategies vary across primate mating
   systems. Finally, measuring the covariance between female choice and
   male inbreeding avoidance behaviour, and between male inbreeding
   avoidance behaviour and male fitness, would help to clarify the role of
   female mate choice in the evolution of male inbreeding avoidance.},

Abstract = {The central Menabe region still holds the largest remnant of dry forest
   in western Madagascar. These forests are home to high floral and faunal
   diversity including a number of local and regional endemics. The forests
   of the central Menabe have been classified as conservation hot-spots.
   However, pressure on these forests is strong and deforestation continues
   on a large scale. To quantify recent forest loss, we used a series of
   satellite images (1973-2010) for estimating annual deforestation rates.
   The overall rate was 0.67 \%, but it accelerated during certain periods
   to over 1.5 \% with a maximum of 2.55 \% per year between 2008 and 2010.
   Not all areas within the forest block of the central Menabe are affected
   similarly. Areas surrounding existing clearings show the highest losses
   of largely undisturbed forest. If deforestation continues at the same
   rate as during the last years, 50 \% of the 1973 forest cover will be
   gone within the next 11-37 years.},

Abstract = {Humans and other primates are distinct among placental mammals in having
   exceptionally slow rates of growth, reproduction, and aging. Primates'
   slow life history schedules are generally thought to reflect an evolved
   strategy of allocating energy away from growth and reproduction and
   toward somatic investment, particularly to the development and
   maintenance of large brains. Here we examine an alternative explanation:
   that primates' slow life histories reflect low total energy expenditure
   (TEE) (kilocalories per day) relative to other placental mammals. We
   compared doubly labeled water measurements of TEE among 17 primate
   species with similar measures for other placental mammals. We found that
   primates use remarkably little energy each day, expending on average
   only 50\% of the energy expected for a placental mammal of similar mass.
   Such large differences in TEE are not easily explained by differences in
   physical activity, and instead appear to reflect systemic metabolic
   adaptation for low energy expenditures in primates. Indeed, comparisons
   of wild and captive primate populations indicate similar levels of
   energy expenditure. Broad interspecific comparisons of growth,
   reproduction, and maximum life span indicate that primates' slow
   metabolic rates contribute to their characteristically slow life
   histories.},

Abstract = {Information technology has been used in diverse ways. It has been
   utilized to reduce costs in the public sector and increase consumer
   satisfaction in the private sector. Technology may also be instrumental
   in improving individuals' healthy behaviors. For instance, statistics
   suggest that technology-based interventions may promote healthy sexual
   behaviors; however, few studies have explored willingness to participate
   in technology mediated interventions. This study uses Diffusion of
   Innovation Theory to identify factors that influence one's intention to
   use a text-message service to receive sexual health information. The
   results indicate that technology adoption factors rather than risk
   beliefs and privacy concerns impacted participant's intention to use a
   text-message intervention. The findings of this study have significant
   implications for innovative uses of technology to promote health.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the properties of the Half
   Bride Current Source bidirectional DC to DC converter used to interface
   supercapacitors with batteries in a hybrid storage system. This work
   focuses on the benefits of applying synchronous rectification to the
   switches of the primary and the secondary side, both in terms of
   efficiency and control simplicity. In fact, by using this modulation
   scheme, it can be demonstrated that a single parameter (the duty ratio,
   D, of the dc link side top switch) can be used to control the converter
   under every operating condition. Furthermore, an average model of the
   converter valid in every operating condition is derived and utilized as
   a tool for the design of the control system. This model includes the
   effects of parasitic elements (mainly the leakage inductance of the
   transformer) and snubbers.
   Both the synchronous rectification switching scheme and the average
   model, have been experimentally validated with a 3 kW converter
   prototype. Also, the performance of a control strategy designed with
   such model are shown experimentally.},

Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-24},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Members of the genus Aotus are traditionally considered strictly
   nocturnal, however, in recent years cathemeral habits have been
   described in a single species of owl monkey, Aotus azarai, which occur
   in the highly seasonal habitat of the Argentinean Chaco. This finding
   raises the question as to whether other species of Aotus exhibit
   cathemeral activity in less seasonal habitats. In this study, we
   observed the diurnal activity of one group of A. nigriceps living in the
   Manu Biosphere Reserve, Peru over 65 days. The data collected indicate
   that A. nigriceps has only sporadic diurnal bouts of activity. In
   addition, nocturnal luminosity of the previous night, rainfall, and
   temperature did not correlate with the minor diurnal activity exhibited.
   This suggests that for A. nigriceps the potential costs of shifting to
   diurnality may outweigh its prospective advantages in this rainforest
   environment.},

   alternative, based on the diversity in transmitted polarizations and set
   up in an original 2x2 MIMO system involving compact antenna arrays.
   Experimentations, carried out on a 280km long transmission, are
   presented. They provide a MIMO channel state information which

Title = {Differences in the Activity Budgets of Yunnan Snub-Nosed Monkeys

Abstract = {The activity budgets of primates reflect their survival strategy.
   Despite existing data on the activity budgets of Yunnan snub-nosed
   monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti), little is known about how activity
   budgets vary between age-sex classes. This study provides the first
   detailed activity budgets subdivided by age-sex class, based on
   observations of the largest habituated group of Rhinopithecus bieti at
   Xiangguqing in Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve. This study was conducted
   from June 2008 to May 2009. We found that adult females spent more time
   feeding (44.8\%) than adult males (39.5\%), juveniles (39.1\%) and
   infants (14.2\%). Females allocated significantly more time to feeding
   than to any other activity. Adult males allocated more time to
   miscellaneous activities (12.5\%) than adult females (3.8\%). Juveniles
   allocated less time to grooming than adults. Infants were being groomed
   6.9\% of the time, the highest proportion among all age-sex classes.
   Adults spent more time feeding, while immature individuals allocated
   more time to moving and other activities. There are several reasons why
   activity budgets can vary by age-sex class: (1) differential
   reproductive investment between males and females; (2) developmental
   differences among the age categories, and (3) social relationships
   between members of different age-sex classes, particularly dominance.
   These variations in activity budgets among the different age-sex classes
   may become a selective pressure in this species. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG,

Title = {Computer-Based Programmed Instruction Did Not Improve the Knowledge
   Retention of Medication Instructions of Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes
   Mellitus},
Journal = {DIABETES EDUCATOR},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {40},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate whether
   computer-based programmed instruction (CPI) with a dynamic avatar (DA)
   improves retention of medication information better than text (controls)
   or better than CPI with text (T-CPI), CPI with voice (V-CPI), or CPI
   with static avatar with text (SA-CPI).
   Methods Participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus were enrolled in a
   randomized controlled trial comparing TDS with CPI in 4 conditions
   (T-CPI, V-CPI, SA-CPI, and DA-CPI). CPI sequentially delivers segmented
   information in text or voice followed by a multiple-choice question.
   Immediately after the user selects an option, CPI delivers elaborated
   feedback. Satisfaction was measured immediately after the interventions,
   and medication knowledge was measured at 2 weeks.
   Results One-hundred fifty individuals (30 per group) with a mean age 62
   years (standard deviation {[}SD] 7.99 years) participated. There were no
   baseline differences in race, body mass index, education, and health
   literacy. Medication knowledge retention at 2 weeks was not
   significantly different between the groups, df(4), F = 0.17, P = .95
   (TDS, mean = 25.43, SD = 5.11; T-CPI, mean = 25.07, SD = 4.98; V-CPI,
   mean = 25.77, SD = 4.89; SA-CPI, mean = 25.83, SD = 5.31; and DA-CPI,
   mean = 24.93, SD = 6.25). Satisfaction scores were significantly lower
   for TDS, df(4), F = 3.11, P = .01.
   Conclusions CPI did not improve medication knowledge retention at 2
   weeks. CPI led to higher patient satisfaction compared with controls.},

Journal = {ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {175-183},
Abstract = {Coquerel's sifaka Propithecus coquereli has a large but highly
   fragmented distribution. Despite its Endangered (EN) IUCN conservation
   status, uncertainties persist regarding its actual distribution and its
   presence in forests that are thought to be part of its distribution
   range. We provide here the first extensive population surveys of
   Coquerel's sifaka across a large number of forest fragments neighboring
   27 sites of its known and expected distribution range in north-western
   Madagascar, including 12 previously visited sites. During our diurnal
   surveys carried out in the dry seasons from 2009 to 2011 we observed the
   species in 26 of the 27 visited sites. Combining our results with
   previously published data, we propose a refined update of the species'
   distribution range and identify areas to be surveyed. We also recorded
   the support tree species on which sifakas were observed, and note that,
   surprisingly, P. coquereli was frequently seen around villages and in
   areas dominated by introduced tree species. Although the species was
   present at almost all the visited sites of its highly fragmented
   distribution range, it remains unclear how viable the populations of a
   significant proportion of these sites actually are. Due to political
   instability and high rates of deforestation, large-scale conservation
   actions are urgently needed. We thus (1) discuss the outline of a
   possible metapopulation conservation action plan for P. coquereli and
   (2) identify priority sites and actions.},

Title = {Male social bonds: strength and quality among co-resident white-faced
   capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus)},
Journal = {BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {151},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {963-992},
Abstract = {Social relationships among immigrant same-sex co-residents have received
   relatively little attention, particularly for species where males are
   the dispersing sex. White-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) are unusual
   in that immigrant males form cooperative alliances with co-resident
   males during intergroup encounters, and also have affiliative and
   tolerant intragroup relationships. We collected approx. 3341 h of focal
   animal data on 25 adult and subadult males in five groups of wild Cebus
   capucinus in the Santa Rosa Sector, Costa Rica, across three distinct
   field seasons. Using generalized linear mixed models, we examined the
   influence of number of co-resident males, group socionomic sex ratio,
   dominance status and age, and past parallel dispersal on social bond
   strength (i.e., proximity, contact rest, grooming, preferred grooming
   partners) and quality (i.e., grooming reciprocity) for 47 unique male
   male dyads. Overall, dyads that included an alpha male had the weakest
   and least equitable bonds, while dyads composed of subordinate males had
   the strongest and most equitable bonds, with subordinate subadult peers
   being most likely to form preferred relationships. Several measures of
   bond strength and quality were highest among dyads in groups with few
   males and low socionomic sex (female-to-male) ratios. Dyad partners who
   had previously engaged in parallel dispersal had slightly better bonds
   than those that did not, suggesting that kinship and/or familiarity may
   be important. Our results indicate that within groups, male
   relationships are influenced by power asymmetry, partner availability,
   and dyad relationship history.},

Abstract = {Dimorphism on dominance and agonistic behaviour in mammals tends to be
   strongly biased toward males. In this review, we focus on a select few
   species of mammals in which females are as or more aggressive than
   males, and/or are dominant to males, and explore the role of androgenic
   hormones in mediating this important difference. While the data are not
   as clear-cut as those published on traditional laboratory mammals, our
   review highlights important endocrine substrates for both organizational
   and activational influences of steroids on female aggressive behaviour.
   We highlight areas in which further observations and experiments are
   crucial, especially the potential facilitative effects of androgens on
   female aggression. Finally, new and innovative techniques, including
   molecular genetics and receptor pharmacology, portend important insights
   into the ways in which androgenic hormones regulate aggressive behaviour

Title = {Wake up and smell the conflict: odour signals in female competition},
Journal = {PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {368},
Number = {1631},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Odour signals used in competitive and aggressive interactions between
   males are well studied in the context of sexual selection. By contrast,
   relatively little is known about comparable signals used by females,
   despite current interest in the evolution of female ornaments and
   weaponry. Available evidence suggests that odour signals are important
   in competitive interactions between female mammals, with reductions or
   reversals of male-biased sexual dimorphism in signalling where female
   competition is intense. Scent marking is often associated with conflict
   between females over access to resources or reproductive opportunities.
   Female scent marks may therefore provide reliable signals of competitive
   ability that could be used both by competitors and potential mates.
   Consistent with this hypothesis, we report that aggressive behaviour of
   female house mice is correlated with the amount of major urinary protein
   (MUP) excreted in their urine, a polymorphic set of proteins that are
   used in scent mark signalling. Under semi-natural conditions, females
   with high MUP output are more likely to produce offspring sired by males
   that have high reproductive success, and less likely to produce
   offspring by multiple different sires, suggesting that females with
   strong MUP signals are monopolized by males of particularly high
   quality. We conclude that odour signals are worthy of more detailed
   investigation as mediators of female competition.},

Abstract = {A nocturnal activity pattern is central to almost all hypotheses on the
   adaptive origins of primates. This enduring view has been challenged in
   recent years on the basis of variation in the opsin genes of nocturnal
   primates. A correspondence between the opsin genes and activity patterns
   of species in Euarchonta-the superordinal group that includes the orders
   Primates, Dermoptera (colugos), and Scandentia (treeshrews)-could prove
   instructive, yet the basic biology of the dermopteran visual system is
   practically unknown. Here we show that the eye of the Sunda colugo
   (Galeopterus variegatus) lacks a tapetum lucidum and has an avascular
   retina, and we report on the expression and spectral sensitivity of cone
   photopigments. We found that Sunda colugos have intact short wavelength
   sensitive (S-) and long wavelength sensitive (L-) opsin genes, and that
   both opsins are expressed in cone photoreceptors of the retina. The
   inferred peak spectral sensitivities are 451 and 562 nm, respectively.
   In line with adaptation to nocturnal vision, cone densities are low.
   Surprisingly, a majority of S-cones coexpress some L-opsin. We also show
   that the ratio of rates of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions of
   exon 1 of the S-opsin gene is indicative of purifying selection. Taken
   together, our results suggest that natural selection has favored a
   functional S-opsin in a nocturnal lineage for at least 45 million years.
   Accordingly, a nocturnal activity pattern remains the most likely
   ancestral character state of euprimates.},

Title = {Ecological consequences of a group fission event in the Tana River

Abstract = {A group of Tana River mangabeys Cercocebus galeritus studied in
   2000-2001 fissioned into two daughter groups in 2004, the first reported
   case of fission in Cercocebus. Data were collected on each daughter
   group in 2005-2006 to investigate how the groups divided the parent
   group's range, the quality of habitat used by each group, and if fruit
   abundance was correlated with the spatial relationships between the
   groups. Six days of ranging data were collected each month and input
   into ArcView GIS 3.3 to measure home ranges and core areas. Phenological
   data were collected from nine important food species. Habitat quality
   was measured by counting all reproductive-sized individuals of those
   nine food species in the ranges. The daughter groups shared the parent
   group's home range and core area, although the larger group used more of
   those areas than the smaller group. The two groups got equal quality
   home ranges and core areas as measured by per capita food trees, but the
   larger group had access to a larger and richer exclusive area. Proximity
   of the groups to each other was not correlated with fruit abundance.
   This study contributes to the small body of literature that addresses
   ecological consequences of primate group fission.
   Resume Un groupe de cercocebes de Tana Cercocebus galeritus etudie en
   2000-2001 s'est scinde en deux groupes en 2004, le premier cas de
   scission rapporte chez cette espece. Des donnees furent recoltees pour
   chaque nouveau groupe en 2005-2006 pour etudier comment ils s'etaient
   partage l'aire de distribution du groupe d'origine et la qualite de
   l'habitat frequente par chacun et pour voir si l'abondance de fruits
   etait liee aux relations spatiales entre les deux groupes. Chaque mois,
   les donnees sur la distribution etaient collectees pendant six jours et
   elles etaient introduites dans ArcView GIS 3.3 pour mesurer les aires de
   distribution et les zones centrales. On a aussi collecte des donnees
   phenologiques pour neuf especes alimentaires importantes. La qualite de
   l'habitat fut mesuree en comptant tous les individus de ces neuf especes
   en age de se reproduire et qui se trouvaient dans l'aire de
   distribution. Les nouveaux groupes partageaient l'aire de distribution
   et la zone centrale du groupe initial, mais le plus grand des deux
   frequentait une plus grande partie de ces zones que le plus petit. Les
   deux groupes avaient des aires de distribution et des zones centrales de
   qualite egale si on les mesure selon le nombre d'arbres alimentaires par
   tete, mais le plus grand groupe pouvait acceder a une zone exclusive
   plus grande et plus riche. La proximite des deux groupes n'etait pas
   liee a l'abondance de fruits. Cette etude vient contribuer au peu de

Title = {Manual Laterality and Strategy Use for a Coordinated Bimanual Task
   Requiring Precise and Power Grip in Guenons and Mangabeys},

Abstract = {Bimanual tasks have been repeatedly shown to elicit manual asymmetries
   supposed to reflect hemispheric specialization. And yet, a coordinated
   bimanual task, the BOX task, appears to be inefficient in detecting
   biases of hand preferences. The BOX task involves two sequential actions
   requiring a precise grip, lift the lid of a box and grasp a small item
   inside the box (while holding the lid). In the present study, we
   compared manual laterality exhibited for the classic bimanual BOX task
   and for a unimanual BOX task in 11 De Brazza's monkeys (Cercopithecus
   neglectus) and 19 red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus). In
   addition, we assessed strategy use for solving the bimanual BOX task. We
   found that left-hand use for grasping the item was higher in the
   BOX-bimanual task than in the BOX-unimanual task. We propose that this
   increase in left-hand use for grasping the item results from both a
   hemispheric specialization for lifting the lid and an advantage in using
   a skillful strategy. Indeed, we revealed (1) group-level right biases
   for lifting the lid and (2) a complete differentiation between the roles
   of the two hands in subjects showing a left-hand preference for grasping
   the item. Finally, the bimanual BOX task showed age differences in the
   two species, either in manual laterality for grasping the item or in
   strategy use. This study provides additional evidence that manual
   laterality might be sensitive to maturational factors and
   characteristics of the bimanual tasks such as the order and the features
   of sequential actions. Am. J. Primatol. 75:1096-1107, 2013. (c) 2013

Abstract = {Numerous hypotheses have been proposed for the historical processes
   governing the rich endemism of Madagascar's biodiversity. The watershed
   model' suggests that drier climates in the recent geological past have
   resulted in the contraction of forests around major watersheds, thereby
   defining areas of endemism. We test whether this hypothesis explains
   phylogeographical patterns in a dry forest-dependent rodent, Eliurus
   myoxinus, an endemic species widely distributed through western
   Madagascar. We sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome b locus and
   nuclear introns of the -fibrinogen and the growth hormone receptor genes
   for E. myoxinus. Using a parametric bootstrapping approach, we tested
   whether the mitochondrial gene tree data fit expectations of local
   differentiation given the watershed model. We additionally estimated
   population differentiation and historical demographic parameters, and
   reconstructed the spatial history of E. myoxinus to highlight spatial
   and temporal patterns of differentiation. The data do not support the
   watershed model as a clear explanation for the genetic patterns of
   diversity within extant E. myoxinus populations. We find striking
   patterns of latitudinal genetic structure within western Madagascar, and
   indicate possible roles for environmental and ecological gradients along
   this axis in generating phylogeographical diversity.(c) 2013 The Linnean

Abstract = {The Seychelles black parrot Coracopsis (nigra) barklyi, endemic to the
   Seychelles islands, is the only surviving parrot on the archipelago.
   Although originally classified as a subspecies of the lesser vasa parrot
   Coracopsis nigra evidence now indicates that the Seychelles population
   may be a distinct species, in which case its conservation status also
   requires reassessment. Here, we address the status of the C. (n.)
   barklyi population on the islands of its current and likely historical
   range, Praslin and Curieuse, assess the effect of habitat type on
   relative abundance, and identify the most appropriate point count
   duration for monitoring the population. We conducted point count
   distance sampling at 268 locations using habitat type as a covariate in
   the modelling of the detection function. Density on Praslin was
   estimated to be 0.14-0.24 individuals per ha, resulting in an estimate
   of a total of 520-900 individuals (95\% confidence interval). The
   highest densities occurred in endemic palm and mixed forests. Habitats
   with a high proportion of palms were more likely to support parrots than
   habitats without palms. As no parrots were detected on Curieuse the
   number estimated on Praslin is the global wild population. The small
   size of this population necessitates its categorization as Vulnerable on
   the IUCN Red List. Our main recommendation for the conservation of C.
   (n.) barklyi, in addition to continued monitoring, is the preservation
   and expansion of the parrot's endemic palm forest habitat.},

Abstract = {We describe a new small-sized microhylid frog of the genus Stumpffia and
   provide a preliminary survey of Stumpffia diversity in northern and
   northwestern Madagascar based on molecular and morphological data.
   Analysis of 68 previously published and 142 newly generated DNA
   sequences of a fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene revealed a
   large genetic diversity within Stumpffia, with numerous strongly
   differentiated lineages occurring across Madagascar. The analysis
   confirmed a clade formed exclusively by Stumpffia species occurring in
   north/northwestern Madagascar and containing almost all species from
   this area. Based on DNA sequences of the RAG1 gene, we further assess
   that most of the deep mitochondrial lineages do not share haplotypes in
   this nuclear marker, even in the few cases of sympatry, which we
   interpret as confirmation of their status as independent evolutionary
   lineages. Micro-computed tomography revealed subtle differences in
   phalangeal formulae among some of these candidate species, providing
   additional taxonomic characters for future revisions of the genus. The
   newly described species Stumpffia analamaina sp. nov. occurs 27 km
   north-west of Ant-sohihy and is at present the southernmost confirmed
   Stumpffia of the north/northwestern clade. It is mainly characterized by
   a snout-vent length of 10-12 mm, advertisement calls consisting of a
   series of short melodious chirps, manus with four fingers and pes with
   five toes, with only slight length reduction of first finger and toe. It
   furthermore does not share haplotypes with any other Stumpffia species
   in 16S or RAG1, and has relatively longer hands and feet compared with
   other small-sized Stumpffia of the north/northwestern clade such as S.
   madagascariensis and S. pygmaea. The new species lives in an area of dry
   forest where it was found in leaf litter along a small stream bordered
   by degraded gallery vegetation. Due to the limited distributions of
   almost all species in the north/northwestern Stumpffia clade, the
   rareness of appropriate microhabitat around the type locality of S.
   analamaina sp. nov. and the rampant habitat destruction in this part of
   Madagascar, we propose a threat status of Critically Endangered for this
   new species.},

Abstract = {Language is a signature of our species and our primary conduit for
   conveying the contents of our minds. The power of language derives not
   only from the exquisite detail of the signal itself but also from its
   intricate link to human cognition. To acquire a language, infants must
   identify which signals are part of their language and discover how these
   signals are linked to meaning. At birth, infants prefer listening to
   vocalizations of human and nonhuman primates; within 3 mo, this
   initially broad listening preference is tuned specifically to human
   vocalizations. Moreover, even at this early developmental point, human
   vocalizations evoke more than listening preferences alone: they engender
   in infants a heightened focus on the objects in their visual environment
   and promote the formation of object categories, a fundamental cognitive
   capacity. Here, we illuminate the developmental origin of this early
   link between human vocalizations and cognition. We document that this
   link emerges from a broad biological template that initially encompasses
   vocalizations of human and nonhuman primates (but not backward speech)
   and that within 6 mo this link to cognition is tuned specifically to
   human vocalizations. At 3 and 4 mo, nonhuman primate vocalizations
   promote object categorization, mirroring precisely the advantages
   conferred by human vocalizations, but by 6 mo, nonhuman primate
   vocalizations no longer exert this advantageous effect. This striking
   developmental shift illuminates a path of specialization that supports
   infants as they forge the foundational links between human language and
   the core cognitive processes that will serve as the foundations of
   meaning.},

Abstract = {Ero1-alpha and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) oxidoreductases of the protein
   disulfide isomerase (PDI) family promote the efficient introduction of
   disulfide bonds into nascent polypeptides in the ER. However, the
   hierarchy of electron transfer among these oxidoreductases is poorly
   understood. In this paper, Ero1-alpha-associated oxidoreductases were
   identified by proteomic analysis and further confirmed by surface
   plasmon resonance. Ero1-alpha and PDI were found to constitute a
   regulatory hub, whereby PDI induced conformational flexibility in an
   Ero1-alpha shuttle cysteine (Cys99) facilitated intramolecular electron
   transfer to the active site. In isolation, Ero1-alpha also oxidized
   ERp46, ERp57, and P5; however, kinetic measurements and redox
   equilibrium analysis revealed that PDI preferentially oxidized other
   oxidoreductases. PDI accepted electrons from the other oxidoreductases
   via its a' domain, bypassing the a domain, which serves as the electron
   acceptor from reduced glutathione. These observations provide an
   integrated picture of the hierarchy of cooperative redox interactions
   among ER oxidoreductases in mammalian cells.},

Title = {Paleoecology of archaeocete whales throughout the Eocene: Dietary
   adaptations revealed by microwear analysis},
Journal = {PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {386},

Abstract = {Archaeocete whales originated from within terrestrial artiodactyls
   around the Paleocene-Eocene boundary and gave rise to modern toothed
   whales (Odontoceti) and baleen whales (Mysticeti) at the end of the
   Eocene. The cetacean transition from life on land to life in water is
   documented by archaeocete fossils reflecting stages of increasing
   aquatic adaptation throughout the Eocene. During this time, feeding and
   diet in cetaceans supposedly changed from herbivory or omnivory to
   piscivory and carnivory. It is still not fully understood whether an
   early dietary shift was the reason for cetaceans to abandon land, or
   whether aquatic feeding evolved later, at a semiaquatic stage. To assess
   archaeocete diet and its evolution through time, we analyzed dental
   enamel microwear of an early Eocene pakicetid, middle Eocene
   protocetids, and middle-to-late Eocene basilosaurids. We quantified wear
   features on shearing facets of upper and lower cheek teeth using
   low-magnification stereoscopic microwear analysis. Results were compared
   with the microwear of extant fully-aquatic odontocetes, semiaquatic
   pinnipeds, and terrestrial carnivores. The microwear of archaeocetes
   strongly resembles that of modern pinnipeds and, to a lesser extent,
   odontocetes that include cephalopods, crustaceans, bivalves and
   gastropods, as well as marine birds and mammals besides fish in their
   diet. The degree of aquatic adaptation in archaeocetes seems to be
   reflected in their diet. Aquatic feeding is already indicated for the
   late early Eocene terrestrial Pakicetus inachus since its microwear
   already resembles that of the middle Eocene semiaquatic protocetids.
   Middle-to-late Eocene fully-aquatic basilosaurids turn out to be
   separated from the protocetids and P. inachus in all parts of the study
   and apparently ingested more or larger hard items. We conclude that
   cetaceans were not primarily piscivorous, and that piscivory and
   carnivory, where present in modern cetacean, evolved from a very diverse
   diet in Eocene archaeocetes that included various kinds of invertebrates
   and vertebrates. Inclusion of mammals in the cetacean diet is not a
   recent dietary specialization but might be as old as the middle Eocene,
   implied by a microwear signal in Qaisracetus arifi similar to those of
   the modern hyena and the killer whale. Consumption of mammal meat was
   very likely well-established in middle-to-late Eocene forms (heavy
   gouging and extremely destructive macroscopic wear in Basilosaurus
   isis). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Reevaluation of the lumbosacral region of Oreopithecus bambolii},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {65},
Number = {3},
Pages = {253-265},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Functional interpretations of the postcranium of the late Miocene ape
   Oreopithecus bambolii are controversial. The claim that Oreopithecus
   practiced habitual terrestrial bipedalism is partly based on restored
   postcranial remains originally recovered from Baccinello, Tuscany
   (Kohler and Moya-Sola, 1997). The lower lumbar vertebrae of BA\#72 were
   cited as evidence that Oreopithecus exhibits features indicative of a
   lordotic lumbar spine, including dorsal wedging of the vertebral bodies
   and a caudally progressive increase in postzygapophyseal interfacet
   distance. Here, we demonstrate why the dorsal wedging index value
   obtained by Miller and Moya-Sola (1997) for the BA\#72 last lumbar
   vertebra is questionable due to distortion in that region, present a
   more reliable way to measure postzygapophyseal interfacet distance, and
   include an additional metric (laminar width) with which to examine
   changes in the transverse dimensions of the neural arches. We also
   quantify the external morphology of the BA\#72 proximal sacrum, which,
   despite well-documented links between sacral morphology and bipedal
   locomotion, and excellent preservation of the sacral prezygapophyses,
   first sacral vertebral body, and right ala, was not evaluated by Kohler
   and Moya-Sola (1997). Measures of postzygapophyseal interfacet distance
   and laminar width on the penultimate and last lumbar vertebrae of BA\#72
   reveal a pattern encompassed within the range of living nonhuman
   hominoids and unlike that of modern humans, suggesting that Oreopithecus
   did not possess a lordotic lumbar spine. Results further show that the
   BA\#72 sacrum exhibits relatively small prezygapophyseal articular facet
   surface areas and mediolaterally narrow alae compared with modern
   humans, indicating that the morphology of the Oreopithecus sacrum is
   incompatible with the functional demands of habitual bipedal stance and
   locomotion. The Oreopithecus lumbosacral region does not exhibit
   adaptations for habitual bipedal locomotion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Pham and Shackelford (2013a) documented that men at greater risk of
   their partner's infidelity reported greater interest in and spent more
   time performing oral sex on their partner. The current study is an
   extension of their study to a female sample. We recruited 200 women to
   investigate whether women's oral sex behaviors are related to the risk
   of their partner's infidelity. The results indicate that women at
   greater risk of partner infidelity did not report more interest in, or
   spend more time performing, oral sex on their partner. Additionally, the
   relationships between partner infidelity risk and interest in, and time
   spent, performing oral sex were greater for men than women. We discuss
   limitations of this research and discuss explanations for the results.

Abstract = {Mammals dominate modern terrestrial herbivore ecosystems, whereas extant
   herbivorous reptiles are limited in diversity and body size. The
   evolution of reptile herbivory and its relationship to mammalian
   diversification is poorly understood with respect to climate and the
   roles of predation pressure and competition for food resources. Here, we
   describe a giant fossil acrodontan lizard recovered with a diverse
   mammal assemblage from the late middle Eocene Pondaung Formation of
   Myanmar, which provides a historical test of factors controlling body
   size in herbivorous squamates. We infer a predominately herbivorous
   feeding ecology for the new acrodontan based on dental anatomy,
   phylogenetic relationships and body size. Ranking body masses for
   Pondaung Formation vertebrates indicates that the lizard occupied a size
   niche among the larger herbivores and was larger than most carnivorous
   mammals. Paleotemperature estimates of Pondaung Formation environments
   based on the body size of the new lizard are approximately 2-5 degrees C
   higher than modern. These results indicate that competitive exclusion
   and predation by mammals did not restrict body size evolution in these
   herbivorous squamates, and elevated temperatures relative to modern
   climates during the Paleogene greenhouse may have resulted in the
   evolution of gigantism through elevated poikilothermic metabolic rates
   and in response to increases in floral productivity.},

Title = {Parasite-mediated selection of major histocompatibility complex
   variability in wild brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) from Inner
   Mongolia, China},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUL 12},
Abstract = {Background: Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) exhibit
   high levels of variability, which is believed to have arisen through
   pathogen-mediated selection. We investigated the relationship between
   parasite load and genetic diversity at selectively neutral, non-coding
   markers (microsatellites) and adaptive genetic variation at a
   functionally important part of the MHC in six independent natural
   populations of Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) from two regions
   of the Xilingol Grassland area of Inner Mongolia.
   Results: Two-hundred and fifty-two voles were screened for
   gastrointestinal parasites, and were assessed for genetic variation.
   Parasite screening was done through non-invasive fecal egg counts, while
   allelic diversity was determined via single-stranded conformation
   polymorphism and DNA sequencing. We detected eight distinct helminth egg
   morphotypes. A total of 10 microsatellite loci were genotyped and 19
   unique MHC class II B alleles were isolated. The rate of nonsynonymous
   substitutions (d(N)) exceeded the rate of synonymous substitutions
   (d(S)) at putative antigen binding sites of DRB. Neutral and adaptive
   genetic diversity differed between the six vole populations. To test the
   main pathogen-driven selection hypotheses for the maintenance of host
   MHC diversity and parasite species-specific co-evolutionary effects,
   multivariate approaches (generalized linear mixed models) were used to
   test for associations between the MHC class II DRB genotype and
   infections with nematodes. We found no evidence for heterozygote
   advantage, and overall heterozygosity was lower than expected in the MHC
   alleles. We identified an association between the parasite load and
   specific MHC alleles in the voles, and this pattern varied between
   geographic regions.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that MHC variability in Brandt's voles
   is maintained by rare allele advantage and fluctuating selection, but
   the data failed to show any heterozygote advantage effect. Our results
   add to a growing body of evidence showing that the mode and relative
   strength of pathogen-driven selection acting on MHC diversity varies
   within specific wild populations. In addition, our study contributes to
   the understanding of what maintains MHC diversity, of host-pathogen
   coevolution and of how genetic diversity is maintained in voles.},

Abstract = {`Arctocyonids' are generally considered as including some of the most
   primitive ungulates' from the Paleocene. Although more than 15 genera
   are known from North America, European members of this order are less
   common and mainly belong to derived genera such as Arctocyon. However,
   one species of primitive arctocyonid, Prolatidens waudruae, was
   described from the early Paleocene of Hainin, Mons Basin, Belgium. Here
   we describe new dental positions of this small taxon, including for the
   first time upper molars and upper fourth premolar. Morphological
   comparisons confirm the position of P. waudruae among primitive
   ungulates,' with the closest North American arctocyonids being
   Prothryptacodon furens and Oxyprimus galadrielae. Oxyprimus galadrielae
   features slightly more primitive morphological traits than both other
   species. Apheliscids share several characters with Prolatidens, but the
   latter lacks the apomorphies defining the family. Among arctocyonids,'
   Prolatidens shares with only Protungulatum and Oxyprimus the incomplete
   lingual cingulum at the base of the protocone of M1. Prolatidens
   waudruae is unique among Procreodi in its combination of primitive and
   derived characters. The cladistic analysis places P. waudruae close to
   the base of the ingroup, indicating that this species is among the most
   primitive members of the Paleocene ungulates.' However, the lower nodes
   of the trees are not well supported and definitive conclusions should
   await more complete specimens and analysis. Apheliscids are situated
   relatively far from Prolatidens, suggesting that the resemblances
   between them are better considered as convergences. Based on the
   morphological comparisons, the arctocyonid from Hainin correlates best
   with North American Torrejonian taxa.},

Abstract = {Urine serves a communicative function in many mammalian species. In some
   species, the signaling function of urine can be enhanced by the addition
   of chemical compounds from glands along the distal portion of the
   urogenital tract. Although urine marking is the main mode of chemical
   communication in many primate species, there has been no study of the
   contribution of urogenital secretions to the chemical complexity of
   primate urine. Here, we compared the chemical composition of bladder
   urine versus voided urine in the aye-aye, Daubentonia madagascariensis,
   a strepsirrhine primate that relies on urine in intraspecific
   communication. Both types of urine, collected from each of 11 aye-ayes
   representing both sexes of varying adult ages, underwent headspace
   analysis via gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Although the
   average number of compounds was similar in bladder and voided urine,
   17\% of the compounds detected occurred exclusively in voided urine (but
   only in a subset of individuals). An overall measure of chemical
   complexity (using a nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis) showed
   that both types of urine were chemically different at the individual
   level. There was no apparent sex or age differences in the chemical
   components found in aye-aye urine. Nonetheless, the individual
   dissimilarities between bladder urine and voided urine indicate chemical
   contributions from structures along the urogenital tract and offer
   further support for the relevance of urinary communication in the
   aye-aye. Am. J. Primatol. 75:695-702, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {This preliminary study characterizes the ultrasonic vocalizations
   produced by Philippine tarsiers, Tarsius syrichta. Data were collected
   at the Philippine Tarsier Foundation Sanctuary in Corella, Bohol,
   Philippines, from July through October 2010. Recordings were made on a
   Wildlife Acoustics Ultrasonic Song Meter 2 BAT from 29 wild, free-living
   adult resident T. syrichta (23 females and six males). A total of 10,309
   USVs were recorded. These vocalizations fell into three main categories:
   chirps, twitters, and whistles. Chirps were the most frequent, followed
   by twitters and whistles. Whereas chirps and twitters were emitted by
   both male and female Philippine tarsiers, whistles were only emitted by
   adult males. Given that vocalizations reported in this study were
   exclusively recorded during capture and handling, it is very likely that
   these vocalizations function as distress calls. However, as the long
   whistle was only given by adult males who were captured at the same time
   as the female or the group's infant, the function of the long whistle
   might be slightly different than the function of the other relatively
   lower-frequency USVs.},

Abstract = {The fossil record of bats is extensive in the Caribbean, but few fossils
   have previously been reported from the Dominican Republic. In this
   paper, we describe new collections of fossil bats from two flooded caves
   in the Dominican Republic, and summarize previous finds from the Island
   of Hispaniola. The new collections were evaluated in the context of
   extant and fossil faunas of the Greater Antilles to provide information
   on the evolution of the bat community of Hispaniola. Eleven species were
   identified within the new collections, including five mormoopids
   (Mormoops blainvillei, dagger Mormoops magna, Pteronotus macleayii, P
   parnellii, and P quadridens), five phyllostomids (Brachyphylla nana,
   Monophyllus redmani, Phyllonycteris poeyi, Erophylla bombifrons, and
   Phyllops falcatus), and one natalid (Chilonatalus micropus). All of
   these species today inhabitant Hispaniola with the exception of dagger
   Mormoops magna, an extinct species previously known only from the
   Quaternary of Cuba, and Pteronotus macleayii, which is currently known
   only from extant populations in Cuba and Jamaica, although Quaternary
   fossils have also been recovered in the Bahamas. Differences between the
   fossil faunas and those known from the island today suggest that
   dispersal and extirpation events, perhaps linked to climate change or
   stochastic events such as hurricanes, may have played roles in
   structuring the modern fauna of Hispaniola.},

Journal = {EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING},
Year = {2013},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for trans-horizon radio
   communications within the high-frequency (HF) band (3 to 30 MHz) is
   presented. The diversity of transmitted polarizations is proposed as an
   alternative to spatial diversity in order to limit the aperture of
   antenna arrays at both ends of the radio link. In a theoretical step
   providing the estimation of capacity gain for different MIMO
   architectures, a 2 x 2 MIMO solution transmitting two complementary
   circular polarizations is identified as a balanced trade-off between
   performance increase and complexity. The design of the corresponding
   system is described with a focus on antenna arrays and the kind of
   signal processing that should be implemented. This novel communication
   system has been tested on a 280-km-long radio link. The first results
   underline a data transfer rate reaching a value of 24.09 kbps (in a
   4.2-kHz bandwidth) that significantly exceeds the current standards for
   HF modems.},

Abstract = {An extensive body of research exists on androgen secretion in males.
   Although androgens are also known to drive patterns of female
   reproductive physiology and behavior, little attention has been paid to
   these male hormones in females. Here, we examined female fecal androgen
   excretion in strictly seasonally breeding wild Assamese macaques (Macaca
   assamensis) and tested the hypothesis that changes in premating season
   fecal androgens vary with female readiness to resume ovarian cycling and
   thus to conceive. Across 2 years, 155 fecal samples were collected from
   seven reproductively quiescent (i.e., acyclic) females during the
   premating season months, August and September. Samples were analyzed for
   immunoreactive epiandrosterone (iEA), a major fecal metabolite of
   testosterone in macaques. Changes in iEA concentrations during the
   premating season were significantly negatively associated with (1) the
   presence of dependent offspring, i.e., lactating females showed a
   smaller change, and (2) with the timing of conceptions in the mating
   seasons, i.e., females that conceived early exhibited the greatest
   changes. These results provide strong evidence for a relationship
   between changes in androgens during the premating season and female
   readiness to conceive. Am J Phys Anthropol 151:311315, 2013. (c) 2013

Title = {A comparison of antemortem tooth loss in human hunter-gatherers and
   non-human catarrhines: Implications for the identification of behavioral
   evolution in the human fossil record},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {151},
Number = {2},
Pages = {252-264},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Middle and Late Pleistocene fossil hominin specimens with severe
   antemortem tooth loss are often regarded as evidence for the precocious
   evolution of human-like behaviors, such as conspecific care or cooking,
   in ancient hominin species. The goal of this project was to ask whether
   the theoretical association between antemortem tooth loss and uniquely
   human behaviors is supported empirically in a large skeletal sample of
   human hunter-gatherers, chimpanzees, orangutans, and baboons. Binomial
   regression modeling in a Bayesian framework allows for the investigation
   of the effects of tooth class, genus, age, and sex on the likelihood of
   tooth loss. The results strongly suggest that modern humans experience
   more antemortem tooth loss than non-human primates and identify age in
   years as an important predictor. Once age is accounted for, the
   difference between the humans and the closest non-human genus
   (chimpanzees) is less pronounced; humans are still more likely on
   average to experience antemortem tooth loss though 95\% uncertainty
   envelopes around the average prediction for each genus show some
   overlap. These analyses support theoretical links between antemortem
   tooth loss and modern human characteristics; humans' significantly
   longer life history and a positive correlation between age and
   antemortem tooth loss explain, in part, the reason why humans are more
   likely to experience tooth loss than non-human primates, but the results
   do not exclude behavioral differences as a contributing factor. Am J

Abstract = {Pathological or traumatic loss of teeth often results in the resorption
   and remodeling of the affected alveoli in mammals. However, instances of
   alveolar remodeling in reptiles are rare. A remodeled alveolus in the
   maxilla of the Chinese theropod Sinosaurus (Lower Jurassic Lower Lufeng
   Formation) is the first confirmed example of such dental pathology in a
   dinosaur. Given the known relationship between feeding behavior and
   tooth damage in theropods (teeth with spalled enamel, tooth crowns
   embedded in bone) and the absence of dentary, maxillary, and
   premaxillary osteomyelitis, traumatic loss of a tooth is most likely the
   cause of alveolar remodeling. Based on the extent of remodeling, the
   injury and subsequent tooth loss were non-fatal in this individual.},

Title = {Faster scaling of visual neurons in cortical areas relative to

Abstract = {Cortical expansion, both in absolute terms and in relation to
   subcortical structures, is considered a major trend in mammalian brain
   evolution with important functional implications, given that cortical
   computations should add complexity and flexibility to information
   processing. Here, we investigate the numbers of neurons that compose 4
   structures in the visual pathway across 11 non-human primate species to
   determine the scaling relationships that apply to these structures and
   among them. We find that primary visual cortex, area V1, as well as the
   superior colliculus (SC) and lateral geniculate nucleus scale in mass
   faster than they gain neurons. Areas V1 and MT gain neurons
   proportionately to the entire cerebral cortex, and represent fairly
   constant proportions of all cortical neurons (36 and 3 \%,
   respectively), while V1 gains neurons much faster than both subcortical
   structures examined. Larger primate brains therefore have increased
   ratios of cortical to subcortical neurons involved in processing visual
   information, as observed in the auditory pathway, but have a constant
   proportion of cortical neurons dedicated to the primary visual
   representation, and a fairly constant ratio of about 45 times more
   neurons in primary visual than in primary auditory cortical areas.},

Title = {Torpor as an emergency solution in Galago moholi: heterothermy is

Abstract = {The expression of heterothermy in the African lesser bushbaby, Galago
   moholi, seems to be strikingly different to most other heterotherms: G.
   moholi uses its ability to enter torpor only rarely and torpor is only
   used by a small fraction of the population. The aim of this study was,
   therefore, to summarize the parameters of torpor use in G. moholi to
   conclude the general patterns and discuss them in comparison to other
   heterotherms to elucidate possible causes and constraints that underlie
   these differences in deployment of heterothermy. Our study was carried
   out on wild animals using temperature loggers and open-flow respirometry
   for measurements of body temperature and metabolic rate, respectively.
   G. moholi uses torpor only as a last resort and not as a routine,
   seasonal behavior. Nevertheless, we found that the general physiological
   patterns of torpor, e.g., torpor bout duration or entry and arousal
   times from torpor, were mainly consistent with those described for other
   nocturnal daily heterotherms. The greatest difference found was the
   unusual low rewarming rates during arousal from torpor, probably due to
   already depleted internal energy stores and thus inability to mobilize
   sufficient energy for endogenous heating. We therefore conclude that
   while general physiological parameters of heterothermy seem to have
   remained conserved in heterotherms, the underlying causes which elicit
   this physiological response, and thus the extent of expression and
   timing of heterothermy, have evolved very differently in different
   groups, depending on body mass and the specific habitat and lifestyle of
   the species.},

Abstract = {Studies of dental macrowear can be useful for understanding masticatory
   and ingestive behavior, life history, and for inferring dietary
   information from the skeletal material of extinct and extant primates.
   Such studies to date have tended to focus on one or two teeth,
   potentially missing information that can be garnered through examination
   of wear patterns across the tooth row. Our study measured macrowear in
   the postcanine teeth of three sympatric cercopithecid species from the
   Tai Forest, Cote d'Ivoire (Cercocebus atys, Procolobus badius, and
   Colobus polykomos), whose diets have been well-described. Inter-specific
   analyses suggest that different diets and ingestive behaviors are
   characterized by different patterns of wear across the molar row, with
   Cercocebus atys emphasizing tooth use near P-4-M-1, P. badius
   emphasizing a large amount of tooth use near M-2-M-3, and Colobus
   polykomos exhibiting wear more evenly across the postcanine teeth.
   Information regarding differential tooth use across the molar row may be
   more informative than macrowear analysis of isolated teeth for making
   inferences about primate feeding behavior. Am J Phys Anthropol

Pages = {792-795},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {An evolutionary history of human female infidelity and consequent sperm
   competition may have caused the evolution of male counter-adaptations.
   The infidelity-detection hypothesis for oral sex proposes that men
   perform oral sex to gather information about their partner's recent
   sexual history. We tested this hypothesis with data secured from 231 men
   in committed, sexual, heterosexual relationships. We found support for
   two derivative predictions: men at a greater recurrent risk of sperm
   competition expressed greater interest in, and spent more time
   performing, oral sex on their partner, even after controlling
   statistically for relationship length, relationship satisfaction, and
   sexual intercourse duration. The discussion addresses limitations of
   this research and highlights directions for future research, including
   distinguishing empirically the infidelity-detection hypothesis from
   alternative hypotheses for oral sex. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {211-215},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Oligopithecids are basal stem catarrhines that make their first
   definitive appearance in the fossil record in the latest Eocene of
   Egypt. Previously, the group was assumed to have gone locally extinct in
   northern Africa shortly after the Eocene Oligocene boundary, with a last
   record at the similar to 31.5 Ma Taqah locality in Oman. Here we
   describe a tiny oligopithecid from the youngest (similar to 29.5-30 Ma)
   primate-bearing horizon in the Jebel Qatrani Formation, based on a
   partial hemimandible with a largely complete first molar. This is the
   first record of an oligopithecid in the upper sequence of that
   Formation, occurring 160 m above the next-youngest oligopithecid-bearing
   locality (Quarry E), and provides a new last appearance datum for
   Oligopithecidae. The species is markedly smaller than its older
   oligopithecid relatives Catopithecus and Oligopithecus, and indeed is
   one of the smallest anthropoids known, suggesting that it represents a
   member of a dwarfed lineage. This material adds to the evidence provided
   by the co-occurring species Afrotarsius chatrathi and Qatrania fleaglei
   for a fairly diverse, but exceedingly rare, small primate fauna at a
   horizon that is otherwise dominated by much larger and more derived
   propliopithecids and parapithecids. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Dental wear in dolphins (Cetacea: Delphinidae) from southern Brazil},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF ORAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {58},
Number = {2},
Pages = {134-141},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {(1) Dental wear is a common phenomenon in mammals. Its occurrence is
   influenced by tooth anatomy, animal physiology, biomechanics and
   behaviour. So far, investigations of dental wear in cetaceans have been
   scanty and superficial. We compare the frequencies of occurrence,
   location and intensity of dental wear in some species of dolphins from
   southern Brazil, South Atlantic Ocean. (2) Teeth of ten species were
   evaluated using a stereoscopic microscope to identify wear facets, which
   were classified according to location, anatomical position and wear
   intensity. (3) Frequencies of dental wear were high for all species with
   exception of Delphinus capensis, with less than 50\% of teeth worn.
   Simultaneous wear facets in the apex and lateral of teeth were more
   common than facets restricted to the apex or lateral faces. Wear on the
   dental crown was more common, but some species showed less frequent wear
   down to the cingulum or root level. Superficial wear seems to be the
   general trend for dolphins, but Stenella coeruleoalba and Pseudorca
   crassidens showed a higher frequency of severe wear. Only for Tursiops
   truncatus the frequencies of wear were significantly different between
   males and females. When considering the ontogeny of dental wear, only
   for T. truncatus and Stenella frontalis indexes of dental wear were
   correlated with body length. (4) Whether dental wear has implications or
   not in fitness and feeding behaviour, severely worn teeth may expose the
   pulp cavity and increase the susceptibility to local infections. (C)

Title = {Surviving the Cold, Dry Period in Africa: Behavioral Adjustments as an
   Alternative to Heterothermy in the African Lesser Bushbaby (Galago
   moholi)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-64},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Behavioral and physiological adaptations are common and successful
   strategies used by small endothermic species to adjust to unfavorable
   seasons. Physiological adaptations, such as heterothermy, e.g., torpor,
   are usually thought to be more effective energy-saving strategies than
   behavioral adjustments. The African lesser bushbaby, Galago moholi, is
   physiologically capable of torpor but expresses heterothermy only under
   conditions of extreme energy limitation, suggesting that it has evolved
   alternative strategies to compensate energetic bottlenecks. We
   hypothesized that Galago moholi survives the unfavorable winter period,
   without -or only rarely- employing torpid phases to save energy, by
   using behavioral thermoregulation. We compared the ecology and behavior
   of Galago moholi in summer and winter by telemetric tracking and
   examined food availability by determination of arthropod and gum
   availability. We found a significant increase in huddling behavior and a
   significant increase in the use of enclosed and insulated sleeping sites
   during winter, as well as a reduction in nightly activity. Galago moholi
   hunted for insects significantly less in winter than in summer, and
   increased gum intake in winter, when gum showed an increase in energy
   content. The availability of high-quality food, albeit in low
   quantities, presumably enables Galago moholi to stay normothermic
   throughout the cold, dry period and to focus on reproduction activities.
   We propose that Galago moholi favors ecological and behavioral
   adjustments over torpor because these are sufficient to meet energy
   requirements of this species, and their advantages (flexibility,
   unrestricted activity, and reproduction) outweigh the energetic benefits
   of heterothermy.},

Title = {Occurrence of the Sunda colugo (Galeopterus variegatus) in the tropical
   forests of Singapore: A Bayesian approach},
Journal = {MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {78},
Number = {1},
Pages = {63-67},
Abstract = {Dermopterans are taxonomically-unique mammals, but little is known about
   their habitat requirements. The Sunda colugo (Galeopterus variegatus),
   which is one of only two living species of dermopterans confined to
   Southeast Asia, reportedly occurs in tropical forests, plantations, and
   gardens. Based on their ecology, however, we predict that tropical
   forests are likely to be their primary habitats. Here, we investigate
   environmental variables that account for the occurrence of G. variegatus
   in Singapore using Bayesian inference. Our results show that G.
   variegatus was only detected in transects with over 95\% canopy cover,
   which was ultimately the most important predictor of colugo occurrence.
   Tropical forests, including disturbed forests, with relatively intact
   canopies are therefore vital for colugos to persist. (C) 2012 Deutsche

Abstract = {Electric vehicles are one of the major keystones on the development of a
   more sustainable society. However, nowadays there are a number of
   obstacles for the full development of the Electric Vehicles and their
   necessary infrastructure. These hurdles tend to slow down the
   implementation of a technology that from other aspects can be considered
   as mature.
   The ELEVTRA Project has been conceived as a response to some lacks
   detected in the electric vehicle market at present. This project -
   framed within the Lifelong Learning Programme of the European
   Union-identifies and addresses new training needs on the EV industry.
   The final outcome of this project is the development of a training
   programme focusing on the professional profile of specialist technicians
   for the maintenance and repair of electric vehicles and charging
   stations. This paper deals with the experience gained during the
   implementation of the project.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {75},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {More species of nocturnal primates are now recognized than in the past,
   because many are cryptic species. Subtle morphological disparities, such
   as pelage pattern and color variation, vocal cues, and genetics have
   aided in elucidating the number of diagnosable species in a genus. The
   slow lorises (genus Nycticebus) once included only two species, but
   recent taxonomic studies resulted in the description of three additional
   species; further incompletely explored variability characterizes each of
   the currently described species. The Bornean loris in particular is
   characterized by pelage and body size variation. In this study, we
   explored facemask variation in the Bornean loris (N. menagensis).
   Differing facemask patterns, particularly influenced by the amount of
   white on the face, significantly clustered together by geographic
   regions, separated by notable geographic boundaries. Our results support
   the recognition of four species of Bornean lorises: N. menagensis, N.
   bancanus, N. borneanus, and N. kayan. Genetic studies are required to
   support these findings and to refine further our understanding of the
   marked variability within the Bornean loris populations. Am. J.

Abstract = {MIMO architectures are generally based on antenna arrays with spatial
   diversity. An implementation in the particular context of trans horizon
   transmission through the ionospheric channel copes with the problem of
   prohibitive array aperture, the wavelength being decametric in the
   corresponding HF frequency band (3-30 MHz). Therefore, this paper
   proposes an alternative resorting to the diversity in transmitted
   polarizations. The design of an original 2x2 MIMO system is detailed and
   the experimentations carried out on a 280km long transmission are
   presented. The first results underline a data transfer rate reaching a
   value of 24.09 kbps (in a 4.2 kHz bandwidth) which significantly exceeds
   the current standards for HF modems.},

Title = {The importance of tau phosphorylation for neurodegenerative diseases},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Fibrillar deposits of highly phosphorylated tau are a key pathological
   feature of several neurodegenerative tauopathies including Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) and some frontotemporal dementias. Increasing evidence
   suggests that the presence of these end-stage neurofibrillary lesions do
   not cause neuronal loss, but rather that alterations to soluble tau
   proteins induce neurodegeneration. In particular, aberrant tau
   phosphorylation is acknowledged to be a key disease process, influencing
   tau structure, distribution, and function in neurons. Although typically
   described as a cytosolic protein that associates with microtubules and
   regulates axonal transport, several additional functions of tau have
   recently been demonstrated, including roles in DNA stabilization, and
   synaptic function. Most recently, studies examining the trans-synaptic
   spread of tau pathology in disease models have suggested a potential
   role for extracellular tau in cell signaling pathways intrinsic to
   neurodegeneration. Here we review the evidence showing that tau
   phosphorylation plays a key role in neurodegenerative tauopathies. We
   also comment on the tractability of altering phosphorylation-dependent
   tau functions for therapeutic intervention in AD and related disorders.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a methodology to improve the line current THD of a
   distribution line configuration with multiple non-linear loads, by means
   of a simple algorithm based on sensing only the voltage at the Point of
   Common Coupling (PCC), thus avoiding the use of line current
   measurement.
   Firstly, the effect of conventional low frequency electromagnetic
   lighting ballasts is quantified by means of actual waveforms that yield
   to a new a circuital model for simulation. The effect on the line
   current distortion of such loads, generating mainly 3rd and 5th
   harmonics on the line current, is then studied. Then, the proposed
   configuration is presented and analyzed, resulting in a significant
   reduction of these harmonics and also the final THD of the line current.
   In this work, a scheme of distributed current controlled converters is
   proposed for mitigating the line current THD. Having the non-linear
   loads inductive behavior, the proposed control must be implemented using
   a full bridge topology in order to achieve the requirements of
   active/reactive power compensation},

Abstract = {Avian remains from the Early Miocene (similar to 17 Ma) Moghra Formation
   of Egypt include new records of `waterbirds' (storks, herons, pelicans
   and allies) and a ratite. Only a single avian fossil has been previously
   reported from Wadi Moghra and, thus, additional knowledge of the
   avifauna complements previously documented faunal and floral assemblages
   and provides a more complete picture of the Early Miocene ecosystem of
   that locality. The presence of ciconiiforms and pelecaniforms is
   consistent with the relatively abundant records of `waterbirds' from
   other African freshwater fossil localities. Moreover, avian fossils from
   Wadi Moghra provide new insight into the avifaunal composition of the
   Early Miocene in Africa, a period that is relatively underrepresented in
   the avian fossil record of that continent.},

Title = {Female parity, male aggression, and the Challenge Hypothesis in wild

Abstract = {The Challenge Hypothesis proposes that testosterone mediates aggression
   during periods of heightened conflict between males, especially episodes
   that have important fitness consequences. Considerable evidence from
   seasonally breeding species provides support for this hypothesis, but
   few data exist in animals that mate year-round. We tested predictions
   generated by the Challenge Hypothesis in chimpanzees, a non-seasonally
   breeding primate, through a study of individuals living in an
   exceptionally large community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda.
   Results indicated that dominance rank had no influence on testosterone
   levels. Instead of rank influencing testosterone production, additional
   analyses revealed an important role for reproductive competition. Male
   chimpanzees displayed more aggression when they were in the same party
   as parous estrous females than when reproductively active females were
   unavailable. Male chimpanzees competed more intensely for mating
   opportunities with parous females than with nulliparas, and as a
   consequence, males displayed more aggression around the former than the
   latter. When males accompanied parous estrous females, their urinary
   testosterone concentrations were significantly higher than baseline
   concentrations. In contrast, urinary testosterone concentrations did not
   exceed baseline when males associated with nulliparous estrous females.
   These differences in testosterone levels could not be attributed to
   mating per se because males copulated equally often with parous and
   nulliparous females. Furthermore, variation in testosterone
   concentrations were not due to males gathering together in large
   parties, as their levels in these situations did not exceed baseline.
   Taken together, these findings, derived from a relatively large sample
   of males and estrous females, replicate those from a prior study and
   furnish additional support for the Challenge Hypothesis. Our results
   suggest that the Challenge Hypothesis is likely to be broadly applicable
   to chimpanzees and increase our understanding of the physiological costs
   to males who compete for estrous females.},

Title = {Macroevolutionary Dynamics and Historical Biogeography of Primate
   Diversification Inferred from a Species Supermatrix},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships, divergence times, and patterns of
   biogeographic descent among primate species are both complex and
   contentious. Here, we generate a robust molecular phylogeny for 70
   primate genera and 367 primate species based on a concatenation of 69
   nuclear gene segments and ten mitochondrial gene sequences, most of
   which were extracted from GenBank. Relaxed clock analyses of divergence
   times with 14 fossil-calibrated nodes suggest that living Primates last
   shared a common ancestor 71-63 Ma, and that divergences within both
   Strepsirrhini and Haplorhini are entirely post-Cretaceous. These results
   are consistent with the hypothesis that the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass
   extinction of non-avian dinosaurs played an important role in the
   diversification of placental mammals. Previous queries into primate
   historical biogeography have suggested Africa, Asia, Europe, or North
   America as the ancestral area of crown primates, but were based on
   methods that were coopted from phylogeny reconstruction. By contrast, we
   analyzed our molecular phylogeny with two methods that were developed
   explicitly for ancestral area reconstruction, and find support for the
   hypothesis that the most recent common ancestor of living Primates
   resided in Asia. Analyses of primate macroevolutionary dynamics provide
   support for a diversification rate increase in the late Miocene,
   possibly in response to elevated global mean temperatures, and are
   consistent with the fossil record. By contrast, diversification analyses
   failed to detect evidence for rate-shift changes near the
   Eocene-Oligocene boundary even though the fossil record provides clear
   evidence for a major turnover event ({''}Grande Coupure'') at this time.
   Our results highlight the power and limitations of inferring
   diversification dynamics from molecular phylogenies, as well as the
   sensitivity of diversification analyses to different species concepts.},

Abstract = {A rapid electrochemical stripping chronopotentiometric procedure to
   determined sulfide in unaltered hydrothermal seawater samples is
   presented. Sulfide is deposited at -0.25 V (vs Ag/AgCl, KCl 3 M) at a
   vibrating gold microwire and then stripped through the application of a
   reductive constant current (typically -2 mu A). The hydrodynamic
   conditions are modulated by vibration allowing a short deposition step,
   which is shown here to be necessary to minimize H2S volatilization. The
   limit of detection (LOD) is 30 nM after a deposition step of 7s. This
   LOD is in the same range as the most sensitive cathodic voltammetric
   technique using a mercury drop electrode and is well below those
   reported previously for other electrodes capable of being implemented in
   situ. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {86},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Uintasoricines are diminutive plesiadapiforms that are found in the
   latest Paleocene through middle Eocene, predominantly in North America.
   They are not a diverse group but individual species may be locally
   abundant and they are a persistent element of the plesiadapiform
   radiation in North America surviving over a span of approximately 16
   million years. Recent field work in southern Wyoming at South Pass has
   led to the discovery of a new genus and species of uintasoricine. The
   new form is smaller in tooth dimensions compared to other known
   uintasoricines, being slightly smaller than Uintasorex montezumicus from
   California. Both the newly described taxon and U. montezumicus are among
   the smallest plesiadapiforms yet known with body weights estimated to be
   20 to 25 g. The sediments of the Cathedral Bluffs Tongue of the Wasatch
   Formation at South Pass contain a unique upland fauna-the presence of a
   distinctive uintasoricine in this assemblage adds further evidence to
   support the notion that this upland environment was a biodiversity
   hotspot during the latest early Eocene.},

Abstract = {The short-beaked echidna is believed to use olfactory cues from a
   cloacal scent gland to attract and locate mates during the breeding
   season. We investigated the chemical composition of echidna secretions,
   including cloacal swabs and solid, waxy exudates from the cloaca and
   spurs. Scent samples from 37 individuals were collected over a 1-year
   period and analyzed using a range of different analytical techniques. A
   total of 186 compounds were identified, including volatile carboxylic
   acids, aldehydes, ketones, fatty acids, methyl esters, ethyl esters,
   terpenes, nitrogen- and sulphur-containing compounds, alcohols, and
   aromatics. Long chain and very long chain monounsaturated fatty acids,
   sterols, and sterol esters were identified as the major constituents of
   solid exudates, some of which have not previously been described from
   any animal skin gland. There was a high degree of composition overlap
   between male and female cloaca swabs; however, there is significant
   variation, which could mediate echidna mating behavior. Many of the
   volatile and nonvolatile chemicals detected are used for communication
   in other species, suggesting that chemical signals have important and
   diverse functions in echidna social interactions.},

Abstract = {Animal locomotion causes head rotations, which are detected by the
   semicircular canals of the inner ear. Morphologic features of the canals
   influence rotational sensitivity, and so it is hypothesized that
   locomotion and canal morphology are functionally related. Most prior
   research has compared subjective assessments of animal ``agility{''}
   with a single determinant of rotational sensitivity: the mean canal
   radius of curvature (R). In fact, the paired variables of R and body
   mass are correlated with agility and have been used to infer locomotion
   in extinct species. To refine models of canal functional morphology and
   to improve locomotor inferences for extinct species, we compare 3D
   vector measurements of head rotation during locomotion with 3D vector
   measures of canal sensitivity. Contrary to the predictions of
   conventional models that are based upon R, we find that axes of rapid
   head rotation are not aligned with axes of either high or low
   sensitivity. Instead, animals with fast head rotations have similar
   sensitivities in all directions, which they achieve by orienting the
   three canals of each ear orthogonally (i.e., along planes at 90 degrees
   angles to one another). The extent to which the canal configuration
   approaches orthogonality is correlated with rotational head speed
   independent of body mass and phylogeny, whereas R is not.},

Abstract = {Our understanding of locomotor evolution in anthropoid primates has been
   limited to those taxa for which good postcranial fossil material and
   appropriate modern analogues are available. We report the results of an
   analysis of semicircular canal size variation in 16 fossil anthropoid
   species dating from the Late Eocene to the Late Miocene, and use these
   data to reconstruct evolutionary changes in locomotor adaptations in
   anthropoid primates over the last 35 Ma. Phylogenetically informed
   regression analyses of semicircular canal size reveal three important
   aspects of anthropoid locomotor evolution: (i) the earliest anthropoid
   primates engaged in relatively slow locomotor behaviours, suggesting
   that this was the basal anthropoid pattern; (ii) platyrrhines from the
   Miocene of South America were relatively agile compared with earlier
   anthropoids; and (iii) while the last common ancestor of cercopithecoids
   and hominoids likely was relatively slow like earlier stem catarrhines,
   the results suggest that the basal crown catarrhine may have been a
   relatively agile animal. The latter scenario would indicate that
   hominoids of the later Miocene secondarily derived their relatively slow
   locomotor repertoires.},
