Abstract = {Hibernation, a metabolic strategy, allows individuals to reduce
   energetic demands in times of energetic deficits. Hibernation is
   pervasive in nature, occurring in all major mammalian lineages and
   geographical regions; however, its expression is variable across
   species, populations, and individuals, suggesting that trade-offs are at
   play. Whereas hibernation reduces energy expenditure, energetically
   expensive arousals may impose physiological burdens. The torpor
   optimization hypothesis posits that hibernation should be expressed
   according to energy availability. The greater the energy surplus, the
   lower the hibernation output. The thrifty female hypothesis, a variation
   of the torpor optimization hypothesis, states that females should
   conserve more energy because of their more substantial reproductive
   costs. Contrarily, if hibernation's benefits offset its costs,
   hibernation may be maximized rather than optimized (e.g., hibernators
   with greater fat reserves could afford to hibernate longer). We assessed
   torpor expression in captive dwarf lemurs, primates that are obligate,
   seasonal, and tropical hibernators. Across 4.5 mo in winter, we
   subjected eight individuals at the Duke Lemur Center to conditions
   conducive to hibernation, recorded estimates of skin temperature hourly
   (a proxy for torpor), and determined body mass and tail fat reserves
   bimonthly. Across and between consecutive weigh-ins, heavier dwarf
   lemurs spent less time in torpor and lost more body mass. At equivalent
   body mass, females spent more time torpid and better conserved energy
   than did males. Although preliminary, our results support the torpor
   optimization and thrifty female hypotheses, suggesting that individuals
   optimize rather than maximize torpor according to body mass. These
   patterns are consistent with hibernation phenology in Madagascar, where
   dwarf lemurs hibernate longer in more seasonal habitats.},

Abstract = {Extractive industries can have significant impacts on ecosystems through
   loss of habitat, degradation of water quality, and direct impact on
   floral and faunal biodiversity. When operations are located in sensitive
   regions with high biodiversity containing endangered or threatened
   species, it is possible to minimize impact on the environment by
   developing programs to scientifically monitor the impact on resident
   flora and fauna species in the early phases of operation so that effects
   can be mitigated whenever possible. This report presents the baseline
   health, nutrition, and trace mineral evaluation for 33 Avahi laniger
   (Eastern wooly lemur) and 15 Lepilemur mustelinus (greater sportive
   lemur) captured and given complete health evaluations that included the
   measurement of fat-soluble vitamins and trace minerals in addition to
   routine complete blood counts, serum chemistries, and parasite
   evaluations. All lemurs appeared healthy on physical examination despite
   the presence of minor wounds consistent with interspecies aggression in
   some individuals. Serum chemistry values were within expected ranges for
   other lemur species; however, A. laniger erythrocytes were significantly
   smaller than those of L. mustelinus. Serum nickel values were markedly
   higher than expected in both species, and selenium, copper, and cobalt
   levels were higher in L. mustelinus compared with A. laniger at the
   study site, as well as values for I. indri or P. diadema reported from
   other locations. Endoparasites and ectoparasites were typical of those
   reported in other wild lemur species, but load and diversity varied
   between A. laniger and L. mustelinus despite inhabiting the same forest
   ecosystem. This baseline assessment provides the foundation for ongoing
   monitoring.},

Title = {No evidence for contagious yawning in lemurs},
Journal = {ANIMAL COGNITION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {19},
Number = {5},
Pages = {889-898},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Among some haplorhine primates, including humans, relaxed yawns spread
   contagiously. Such contagious yawning has been linked to social bonds
   and empathy in some species. However, no studies have investigated
   contagious yawning in strepsirhines. We conducted an experimental study
   of contagious yawning in strepsirhines, testing ring-tailed and ruffed
   lemurs (n = 24) in a paradigm similar to one that has induced contagious
   yawning in haplorhines. First, in a control experiment, we investigated
   whether lemurs responded to projected video content in general
   (experiment 1). We showed them two videos to which we expected
   differential responses: one featured a terrestrial predator and the
   other a caretaker holding food. Next, to test for yawn contagion, we
   showed individual lemurs life-size video projections of groupmates and
   conspecific strangers yawning, and control footage of the same
   individuals at rest (experiment 2). Then, to examine whether a group
   context might enhance or allow for contagion, we exposed subjects to the
   same videos in a group setting (experiment 3). Lemurs produced alarm
   vocalizations and moved upward while viewing the predator, but not the
   caretaker, demonstrating that they do perceive video content
   meaningfully. However, lemurs did not yawn in response to yawning
   stimuli when tested alone, or with their groupmates. This study provides
   preliminary evidence that lemurs do not respond to yawning stimuli
   similarly to haplorhines, and suggests that this behavior may have
   evolved or become more exaggerated in haplorhines after the two major
   primate lineages split.},

Abstract = {The composition, structure and distribution of forest trees in Ankarafa
   Forest in the Sahamalaza-Iles Radama National Park, Madagascar, were
   evaluated to determine the influence of their fruiting on the seasonal
   feeding/foraging ecology of the mainly frugivorous, endemic blue-eyed
   black lemur (Eulemur flavifrons). Plots were sampled within the forest
   core and on the forest edges. A total of 848 live trees belonging to 42
   species, 39 genera and 28 families were recorded. Ankarafa Forest is
   dominated by Mangifera indica (an exotic), Garcinia pauciflora,
   Sorindeia madagascariensis, Grangeria porosa, bamboo spp. and
   Mascarenhasia arborescens. More than 20\% of the stems counted were
   exotic, long-lived species which has a negative consequence for future
   forest dynamics. In particular the predominance of the exotic M. indica
   has negative implications for fruit availability at the end of the dry
   season and during the wet season. Canopy height was lower than most
   tropical forests but similar to other Malagasy forests with an average
   tree height of 10 +/- 3.6 m and a mean diameter at breast height of 13.8
   +/- 11.7 cm. Height and diameter of trees differed significantly between
   the edge and core of the forest. However, most trees were between 5 and
   15 m high, and most of smaller diameter, both at the edge and core,
   suggesting it is a complex system. Along the forest edge, many trees
   were burnt by uncontrolled fire. Trees felled by cyclones were recorded
   both on the edge and in the core of the forest. Fruit availability was
   similar throughout the forest on a spatial scale, but differed
   temporally. Being relatively high in tree species diversity, Ankarafa
   Forest needs to be protected to continue to support its endemic fauna,
   particularly those with restricted distribution such as the blue-eyed
   black lemur. In particular, further forest degradation and fragmentation
   needs to be avoided.},

Abstract = {Hunting is one of the greatest threats to nonhuman primates worldwide.
   Despite Madagascar's status as a primate mega-diversity country, a
   critical lack of information on the hunting of lemurs at the national
   scale persists. Here, we synthesize the current state of knowledge of
   the annual rates of household-level lemur hunting near ten protected
   areas, representing most ecoregions in Madagascar. We examine geographic
   and taxonomic variation in lemur hunting, including an analysis of
   hunting relative to species density, extinction risk, and intrinsic
   ecological characteristics of species. We found that lemurs are commonly
   hunted across Madagascar; the rural households in our study ate, on
   average, more than one lemur each year, or a median of 4.1\% of the
   lemur species' population size where densities are known. However, this
   pressure varied significantly across sites and species, reaching its
   highest levels in the northeastern rainforest region. While hunting
   levels are concerning for numerous threatened species, hunting pressure
   was driven primarily by species availability, and among ecological
   traits, small body size was related to increased hunting; however,
   conservation status showed no such relationship. This first
   national-level assessment of hunting, including one-third of
   Madagascar's lemur species and more than a tenth of the world's
   primates, identifies regional variation and lemur taxa at acute risk
   from hunting-important steps toward developing targeted strategies to
   conserve one of the world's most threatened groups of vertebrates.},

Abstract = {Objectives As many primates live in forests where visibility is limited,
   the ability to detect the aroma of distant fruit and navigate odor
   plumes would be highly adaptive. Our study is the first to investigate
   this ability with strepsirrhine primates.
   Materials and Methods We tested the ability of a group of ring-tailed
   lemurs to detect hidden fruit from afar using scent alone. We hid
   containers in the underbrush of a semi-natural forest, some baited with
   real cantaloupe and some with sham cantaloupe, 4-17 m from a path
   routinely used by the lemurs. Crucially, the containers were not visible
   from the path. Therefore, the lemurs had to use olfactory cues, but did
   not have to prioritize them to locate the bait.
   Results The lemurs found the real cantaloupe on days that the wind blew
   the scent of the fruit toward the trail. They did not find the sham
   cantaloupe. Upon detecting the odor of the bait, the lemurs sniffed the
   air at one or more locations as they moved toward the bait, a process of
   navigation known as klinotaxis.
   Discussion The traditional belief is that primates are unable to track
   odor plumes. The untrained lemurs in this study were able to detect the
   odor of the cantaloupe among the complex odors of the forest and
   navigate the odor plume to the fruit. The results indicate that
   olfaction may be used to respond to cues from distant sources. The
   ability to track odor plumes may be a critical foraging skill for
   strepsirrhines.},

Abstract = {Vocalizations are used by group-living animals as aggressive and
   submissive signals during agonistic interactions, and are also used to
   maintain dominance hierarchies in many species. For gregarious
   strepsirrhines with large vocal repertoires and differentiated dominance
   ranks like the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), agonistic vocalization
   use is important to study to better understand their social
   adaptations.To determine whether ring-tailed lemur vocalizations such as
   the yip, cackle, twitter, chutter, and plosive bark were used as
   aggressive or submissive signals during agonism and uttered at different
   rates by males of differing dominance ranks and ages, 565 h of focal
   data were collected on 31 individual males aged >= 1 year from Beza
   Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar. Yip, cackle, and twitter
   vocalizations were consistently used during agonistic submissive
   interactions with both males and females, chutter vocalizations were
   used during aggressive agonistic interactions with males and submissive
   agonistic interactions with males and females, and plosive bark
   vocalizations were used across behavioural contexts but not particularly
   during agonism. Males of all ages employed all vocalizations, and while
   low-ranking males uttered yip calls at higher rates, males of all
   dominance ranks uttered cackle, twitter, chutter, and plosive bark
   vocalizations. These results advance our knowledge of how male lemurs
   utilize agonistic vocalizations to maintain inter-individual
   relationships with males and females, and improve our overall
   understanding of the function of different agonistic vocalizations in
   wild lemurs.},

Abstract = {The Critically Endangered blue-eyed black lemur Eulemur flavifrons of
   north-western Madagascar is one of the most threatened primates. The
   majority of research and conservation efforts for the species have been
   restricted to the Sahamalaza Peninsula but there are unstudied and
   unprotected populations farther inland. The dearth of information
   regarding the transition between E. flavifrons and its parapatric sister
   species, the Vulnerable black lemur Eulemur macaco, and the possibility
   of a hybrid population complicates conservation planning for both
   species. We surveyed 29 forest fragments across both species' ranges to
   investigate the boundary between the taxa, whether hybrids persist, and
   the threats to lemurs in the region. We found E. flavifrons in six
   fragments and E. macaco in 17. We never observed E. flavifrons and E.
   macaco in the same location and we found no conclusive evidence of
   hybrids. Three fragments in which E. flavifrons was present were north
   of the Andranomalaza River, which had previously been considered the
   barrier between the two species. Based on these observations and a
   literature review, we provide updated ranges, increasing the extent of
   occurrence (EOO) of E. flavifrons by 28.7\% and reducing the EOO of E.
   macaco by 44.5\%. We also evaluate the capacity of protected areas to
   conserve these lemurs. We recommend additional surveys and the
   implementation of an education programme in this region to help conserve
   both species.},

Title = {Subfossil lemur discoveries from the Beanka Protected Area in western

Volume = {93},

Abstract = {A new fossil site in a previously unexplored part of western Madagascar
   (the Beanka Protected Area) has yielded remains of many recently extinct
   vertebrates, including giant lemurs (Babakotia radofilai,
   Palaeopropithecus kelyus, Pachylemur sp., and Archaeolemur edwardsi),
   carnivores (Cryptoprocta spelea), the aardvark-like Plesiorycteropus
   sp., and giant ground cuckoos (Coua). Many of these represent
   considerable range extensions. Extant species that were extirpated from
   the region (e.g., Prolemur simus) are also present. Calibrated
   radiocarbon ages for 10 bones from extinct primates span the last three
   millennia. The largely undisturbed taphonomy of bone deposits supports
   the interpretation that many specimens fell in from a rock ledge above
   the entrance. Some primates and other mammals may have been prey items
   of avian predators, but human predation is also evident. Strontium
   isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86) suggest that fossils were local to the
   area. Pottery sherds and bones of extinct and extant vertebrates with
   cut and chop marks indicate human activity in previous centuries.
   Scarcity of charcoal and human artifacts suggests only occasional
   visitation to the site by humans. The fossil assemblage from this site
   is unusual in that, while it contains many sloth lemurs, it lacks
   ratites, hippopotami, and crocodiles typical of nearly all other
   Holocene subfossil sites on Madagascar.},

Title = {Comparative Genomic Analysis of the Pheromone Receptor Class 1 Family

Abstract = {Sensory gene families are of special interest for both what they can
   tell us about molecular evolution and what they imply as mediators of
   social communication. The vomeronasal type-1 receptors (V1Rs) have often
   been hypothesized as playing a fundamental role in driving or
   maintaining species boundaries given their likely function as mediators
   of intraspecific mate choice, particularly in nocturnal mammals. Here,
   we employ a comparative genomic approach for revealing patterns of V1R
   evolution within primates, with a special focus on the small-bodied
   nocturnal mouse and dwarf lemurs of Madagascar (genera Microcebus and
   Cheirogaleus, respectively). By doubling the existing genomic resources
   for strepsirrhine primates (i.e. the lemurs and lorises), we find that
   the highly speciose and morphologically cryptic mouse lemurs have
   experienced an elaborate proliferation of V1Rs that we argue is
   functionally related to their capacity for rapid lineage
   diversification. Contrary to a previous study that found equivalent
   degrees of V1R diversity in diurnal and nocturnal lemurs, our study
   finds a strong correlation between nocturnality and V1R elaboration,
   with nocturnal lemurs showing elaborate V1R repertoires and diurnal
   lemurs showing less diverse repertoires. Recognized subfamilies among
   V1Rs show unique signatures of diversifying positive selection, as might
   be expected if they have each evolved to respond to specific stimuli.
   Furthermore, a detailed syntenic comparison of mouse lemurs with mouse
   (genus Mus) and other mammalian outgroups shows that orthologous
   mammalian subfamilies, predicted to be of ancient origin, tend to
   cluster in a densely populated region across syntenic chromosomes that
   we refer to as a V1R ``hotspot.{''}},

Title = {The microbiome of Haemaphysalis lemuris (Acari: Ixodidae), a possible

Abstract = {Lemurs are primate species that are endemic to Madagascar. At present,
   about 90\% of lemur species are endangered, and 5 species are among the
   25 most endangered primates worldwide. Health status is a major factor
   impacting the viability of wild populations of many endangered species
   including lemurs. Given this context, we analyzed the microbiome of 24
   specimens of Haemaphysalis lemuris, the most common tick parasitizing
   lemurs in their native habitats. Ticks were collected from 6 lemur
   species and microbiomes analyzed using next-generation sequencing. Our
   results show that the H. lemuris microbiome is highly diverse, including
   over 500 taxa, 267 of which were identified to genus level. Analysis of
   the microbiome also shows that there is a distinct ``host{''} (lemur
   species) component when explaining the differences among and between
   microbial communities of H. lemuris. This ``host{''} component seems to
   overwhelm any ``locality{''} (geographic origin of the sample)
   component. In addition to the microbiome data, targeted PCR was used to
   test for the presence of three pathogens recently detected in the blood
   of wild lemurs: Borrelia sp., Candidatus Neoehrlichia sp., and Babesia
   sp. Overall, the presence of DNA of Rickettsia spp., Bartonella spp.,
   Francisella spp., and a Babesia sp., in H. lemuris, is consistent with
   the hypothesis that these ectoparasites may act as vector for these
   pathogens. Further studies assessing vector competence are needed to
   confirm this hypothesis.},

Title = {Consistent individual variation across interaction networks indicates
   social personalities in lemurs},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {136},
Pages = {217-226},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Group members interact with each other during multiple social behaviours
   that range from aggressive to affiliative interactions. It is not known,
   however, whether an individual's suite of social behaviours consistently
   covaries through time and across different types of social interactions.
   Consistent social behaviour would be advantageous in groups, especially
   when individuals need to remember their group members' social roles and
   preferences in order to keep track of social relationships and predict
   conspecifics' future behaviour. Here, we address whether social
   behaviour of ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, is consistent through time
   and across four interaction networks (aggression, grooming, contact
   calling, scent marking). We quantified variation in social behaviour
   through four network centrality measures including outdegree,
   outstrength, betweenness and eigenvector centrality. Comparing lemurs'
   measures across 2 years revealed that network centrality remained
   consistent between years. Lemurs' centrality also stayed consistent
   across interaction networks: individuals with high centrality in one
   interaction network also had high centrality in the other networks, even
   when we controlled for sex-based variation in social behaviour. Thus,
   regardless of their sex, some individuals were highly social and
   frequently groomed others, initiated aggressive interactions and
   responded to others' contact calls and scent marks. Lemurs also had
   preferred social partners they frequently interacted with across years
   and across multiple behaviours. In particular, lemurs frequently
   responded to the contact calls and the scent marks of the conspecifics
   they had frequently groomed. Together, these results demonstrate that
   individual variation in lemur social behaviour is not context specific,
   but instead persists through time and across multiple social
   interactions. Such consistent behaviour provides evidence of social
   personalities, which may influence individuals' interaction styles,
   including how socially active they are and with whom they interact. (C)

Title = {Exploring the Role of Wealth and Religion on the Ownership of Captive
   Lemurs in Madagascar Using Qualitative and Quantitative Data},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {89},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-96},
Abstract = {Primates are kept as pets for various reasons including as indicators of
   wealth. Ownership of primates can also be influenced by religion. In
   Madagascar, thousands of lemurs are kept as pets, but the roles of
   wealth and religion in the ownership of captive lemurs have not been
   explored. We use quantitative and qualitative data to examine these
   aspects of ownership. Quantitative data were collected (July to August
   2016) in households (n = 596) of 12 urban and rural towns in Madagascar
   using semi-structured interviews. International standards for research
   ethics were followed. Research was approved by an ethics oversight
   committee. We also opportunistically visited 13 religious facilities.
   Qualitative data were used to frame the context of the quantitative
   data. We found that pet lemur owners do not speak about their lemurs as
   a symbol of wealth, but non-owners associate pet lemurs with wealth.
   Therefore, status/wealth may be a motivating factor in the ownership of
   pet lemurs. We also found evidence that Catholic entities in Madagascar
   sometimes take in captive lemurs when the owner can no longer care for
   the animal (being viewed as animal-friendly institutions). However, we
   did not find evidence of religion (institutional or traditional)
   influencing the ownership of pet lemurs. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {Primates require secure sleeping sites for periods of rest, but despite
   their importance, the characteristics of desired sleeping sites are
   poorly known. Here we investigated the sleeping ecology of a
   radio-collared population of the Sambirano mouse lemur, Microcebus
   sambiranensis, during the nonreproductive season in the Anabohazo
   forest, northwestern Madagascar. We also investigated their ranging
   behavior and examined the spatial distribution of sleeping sites within
   the home ranges of the collared individuals. We took measurements of the
   sleeping tree's physical characteristics and recorded the number of
   collared individuals using each sleeping site. We found that M.
   sambiranensis generally use foliage sleeping sites more frequently than
   tree holes and individuals slept more frequently in densely foliated
   trees than in sparsely foliated trees, often alone. We observed no
   significant differences in home range size or nightly travel distance
   between males and females; however, home ranges were smaller than those
   described for other mouse lemur species. Finally, we found that M.
   sambiranensis sleep peripherally and forage centrally within their home
   ranges, a behavior not previously described for mouse lemurs. Our
   results indicate profound differences in the social organization between
   M. sambiranensis and other mouse lemur species described in the
   literature, suggesting species-specificity in mouse lemur ecology.
   Understanding the sleeping ecology and ranging behavior of mouse lemurs
   is of great importance to their conservation, as these data facilitate
   the planning of long-term reforestation, habitat management, and
   population assessment.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Primate vocalizations convey a variety of information to conspecifics.
   The acoustic traits of these vocalizations are an effective vocal
   fingerprint to discriminate between sibling species for taxonomic
   diagnosis. However, the vocal behavior of nocturnal primates has been
   poorly studied and there are few studies of their vocal repertoires. We
   compiled a vocal repertoire for the Endangered Sambirano mouse lemur,
   Microcebus sambiranensis, an unstudied nocturnal primate of northwestern
   Madagascar, and compared the acoustic properties of one of their call
   types to those of M. murinus and M. rufus. We recorded vocalizations
   from radio-collared individuals using handheld recorders over 3 months.
   We also conducted an acoustic survey to measure the vocal activity of M.
   sambiranensis in four forest habitat types at the study site. We
   identified and classified five vocalization types in M. sambiranensis.
   The vocal repertoires of the three Microcebus species contain very
   similar call types but have different acoustic properties, with one loud
   call type, the whistle, having significantly different acoustic
   properties between species. Our acoustic survey detected more calls of
   M. sambiranensis in secondary forest, riparian forest, and forest edge
   habitats, suggesting that individuals may prefer these habitat types
   over primary forest. Our results suggest interspecific differences in
   the vocal repertoire of mouse lemurs, and that these differences can be
   used to investigate habitat preference via acoustic surveys.},

Abstract = {Implicit learning involves picking up information from the environment
   without explicit instruction or conscious awareness of the learning
   process. In nonhuman animals, conscious awareness is impossible to
   assess, so we define implicit learning as occurring when animals acquire
   information beyond what is required for successful task performance.
   While implicit learning has been documented in some nonhuman species, it
   has not been explored in prosimian primates. Here we ask whether
   ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) learn sequential information
   implicitly. We tested lemurs in a modified version of the serial
   reaction time task on a touch screen computer. Lemurs were required to
   respond to any picture within a 2 x 2 grid of pictures immediately after
   its surrounding border flickered. Over 20 training sessions, both the
   locations and the identities of the images remained constant and
   response times gradually decreased. Subsequently, the locations and/or
   the identities of the images were disrupted. Response times indicated
   that the lemurs had learned the physical location sequence required in
   original training but did not learn the identity of the images. Our
   results reveal that ring-tailed lemurs can implicitly learn spatial
   sequences, and raise questions about which scenarios and evolutionary
   pressures give rise to perceptual versus motor-implicit sequence
   learning.},

Title = {Rapid Decrease in Populations of Wild Ring-Tailed Lemurs (Lemur catta)

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {87},
Number = {5},
Pages = {320-330},
Abstract = {Lemurs are the most threatened group of mammals on earth. Lemur catta
   (ring-tailed lemur) represents one of the most iconic lemur species and
   faces numerous anthropogenic threats in the wild. In this study, we
   present population estimates from 32 sites across the range of L. catta,
   collected from primary and secondary data sources, to assess the number
   of ring-tailed lemurs left in the wild. We estimate that there are
   approximately 2,220 individual L. catta remaining in the 32 sites
   considered. We note local extinctions of populations of L. catta in at
   least 12 of the 32 sites examined, and that significantly more
   extinctions occurred in areas without some form of protection. This
   decrease in extant populations could represent a decrease of more than
   95\% of all ring-tailed lemurs in Madagascar since the year 2000. While
   these results should be considered preliminary, we stress the rapid
   decline of the species and note that habitat loss, bush-meat hunting and
   the illegal pet trade are driving populations to local extinction. Based
   on the data presented here, urgent and immediate funding and
   conservation action are crucial to ensure the viability of the remaining
   wild populations of ring-tailed lemurs. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Title = {Unpredictable Environments, Opportunistic Responses: Reproduction and
   Population Turnover in Two Wild Mouse Lemur Species (Microcebus Rufus
   and M-Griseorufus) From Eastern and Western Madagascar},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {77},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Small-bodied, nocturnal mouse lemurs (Microcebus) are widespread across
   diverse forest habitats in Madagascar. They are strict seasonal breeders
   and can, depending on the habitat and species, undergo daily or
   prolonged torpor to minimize energy expenditure during periods of food
   and water scarcity. Duration of reproduction, number of litters per
   season and timing of births vary across individuals and species. The
   ``polyestry-seasonality{''} hypothesis proposes that the duration of
   reproduction and number of litters per year are positively correlated
   with rainfall but negatively correlated with longevity, whereas the
   ``hypervariability{''} hypothesis suggests that the duration of
   reproduction is negatively correlated with the degree of predictability
   of food resources. We test these hypotheses in two mouse lemur species
   inhabiting contrasting habitats, the brown mouse lemurs, Microcebus
   rufus, from Ranomafana (a less seasonal and more climatically
   predictable habitat) and the gray-brown mouse lemurs, M. griseorufus,
   from Beza Mahafaly (a more seasonal and less climatically predictable
   environment). We use capture/mark/recapture techniques and records of
   female reproductive status. We found evidence of polyestry at both study
   sites but faster population turnover and longer duration of the
   reproductive season at Beza Mahafaly. The ``polyestry-seasonality{''}
   hypothesis is not supported but the ``hypervariability{''} hypothesis
   could not be rejected. We conclude that reproductive output cannot be
   tied to climatic factors in a simple manner. Paradoxically, polyestry
   can be expressed in contrasting habitats: less seasonal forests where
   females can sustain multiple reproductive events, but also highly
   seasonal environments where females may not fatten sufficiently to
   sustain prolonged torpor but instead remain active throughout the year
   by relying on fallback resources. Am. J. Primatol. 77: 936-947, 2015.

Title = {Striking longevity in a hibernating lemur},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {296},
Number = {3},
Pages = {177-188},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Body mass correlates with life span across mammals; larger species tend
   to live longer than small ones. There are, however, exceptions to this
   pattern. One metabolic strategy that has been linked to increased
   longevity is hibernation; that is, small-bodied hibernating mammals live
   longer than expected based on their size alone. Hibernation may be
   beneficial in seasonal and unpredictable habitats because individuals
   can reduce metabolic rates to conserve energy in times of resource
   scarcity. On the downside, the extended periods of dormancy hibernating
   mammals undergo afford them fewer reproductive opportunities per year
   compared with their similarly sized non-hibernating relatives. One
   strategy to compensate for a reduced reproductive rate is to extend
   reproductive life span. Increased longevity may also be expected if
   hibernators possess cellular machinery resilient to metabolic stress,
   which is generally associated with aging. Here we present data on life
   span and other life-history variables for four small-bodied
   strepsirrhine primates: (1) the fat-tailed dwarf lemur Cheirogaleus
   medius, a hibernator; (2) the gray mouse lemur Microcebus murinus, a
   closely related species, which opportunistically expresses torpor and/or
   hibernation; (3) the Northern giant mouse lemur Mirza zaza another
   closely related species, which does not hibernate, but may employ daily
   torpor; (4) the bushbaby Galago moholi, a non-lemur, non-hibernating
   strepsirrhine that employs torpor only as an emergency response to harsh
   conditions. We analyzed newly compiled captive data from the developing
   Duke Lemur Center Database, and report that dwarf lemurs live
   significantly longer, reproduce longer and show later incidences of both
   morphologic and reproductive senescence than the other species analyzed.
   That these correlations hold in captive populations with no predation
   indicates that intrinsic biologic effects must play some role.},

Volume = {86},

Abstract = {The Ankilitelo cave site, Madagascar, contains a large collection of
   extant and recently extinct subfossil lemurs including the extant taxa
   Lemur catta and Eulemur rufifrons, which today are rarely found in
   sympatry. Dates for this assemblage range from 300 to 13,000 BP, though
   known dates for extinct primate specimens range between 500 and 600 BP.
   Data from Ankilitelo L. catta and E. rufifrons were compared to assess
   tooth wear in synnpatric, related forms. Wear was scored using an
   ordinal scale from 0 to 5. For P4, M1 and M2, E. rufifrons displays
   significantly more wear than L. catta. Ankilitelo represents one of the
   most southerly samples of E. rufifrons, and wear data suggest that in
   the recent (i.e. Holocene) past, their diet near the edges of their
   geographic range included mechanically challenging foods. In contrast,
   synnpatric L cotta was using foods in this transitional humid-dry forest
   with succulent woodlands that were not significantly impacted by recent
   human actions, and for which they were dentally adapted. Results also
   suggest that this non-gallery forest habitat may be the `adaptive home'
   of L. catta, given the lack of notable tooth wear when compared to
   populations currently living in tamarind-dominated riverine gallery
   forests. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {Evolutionary theories suggest that ecology is a major factor shaping
   cognition in primates. However, there have been few systematic tests of
   spatial memory abilities involving multiple primate species. Here, we
   examine spatial memory skills in four strepsirrhine primates that vary
   in level of frugivory: ruffed lemurs (Varecia sp.), ring-tailed lemurs
   (Lemur catta), mongoose lemurs (Eulemur mongoz), and Coquerel's sifakas
   (Propithecus coquereli). We compare these species across three studies
   targeting different aspects of spatial memory: recall after a
   long-delay, learning mechanisms supporting memory and recall of multiple
   locations in a complex environment. We find that ruffed lemurs, the most
   frugivorous species, consistently showed more robust spatial memory than
   the other species across tasks-especially in comparison with sifakas,
   the most folivorous species. We discuss these results in terms of the
   importance of considering both ecological and social factors as
   complementary explanations for the evolution of primate cognitive
   skills.},

Title = {Male-Specific Use of the Purr in the Ring-Tailed Lemur (Lemur catta)},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {85},
Number = {4},
Pages = {201-214},
Abstract = {In mammals, purring has been described in mostly affiliative contexts.
   In the ringtailed lemur (Lemur catta), both males and females purr, but
   only males were observed purring in agonistic contexts. In order to
   determine whether male ring-tailed lemurs purr as aggressive displays
   during intrasexual agonistic encounters, 480 h of focal data were
   collected on 25 adult males from Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve,
   Madagascar, from March to July 2010. The male purring rate increased
   during periods of male-male agonism when compared to times without
   intrasexual agonism, and the purring rate was positively correlated with
   male dominance rank. However, the purring rate was not significantly
   higher during winning agonistic interactions when compared with losing
   encounters. My results indicate that the male ring-tailed lemur purr is
   used most frequently as an agonistic vocalization in male-male
   encounters, in addition to being used less frequently in other social
   contexts, including during tail-waving at females, resting,
   scent-marking, feeding and copulation. Dominant males have higher
   purring rates across social situations, suggesting that the purring rate
   may be driven by intrinsic male qualities rather than functioning as a
   meaningful signal in each disparate social context. Male purring in
   intrasexual agonistic encounters can be added to previously described
   social contexts for ring-tailed lemur purring. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG,

Title = {Climate change, predictive modeling and lemur health: Assessing impacts
   of changing climate on health and conservation in Madagascar},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {409-422},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Deforestation and a changing climate threaten the health and survival of
   lemurs in Madagascar. An important component of lemur health, parasite
   infection can reduce fitness and survival outcomes. Future lemur
   parasite richness, abundance and distribution may be highly influenced
   by climate change. Current knowledge of lemur parasites is narrow in
   geographic and temporal scope, with sampling at a limited number of
   sites, and thus far, there have been no attempts to assess the effects
   of climate change on lemur parasite distributions. We used geospatial
   tools to predict the distributions of six lemur parasites of high
   frequency and pathogenic potential. We then assessed how anticipated
   climate shifts in Madagascar may alter the distributions of these lemur
   parasites in the future. Under current climate conditions, we found that
   the focal parasites exhibited widespread potential distributions across
   Madagascar, covering 12-26\% of surface land area and 40-86\% of
   forested area. Our analyses also showed that parasites responded
   differently to projected climate changes, with shifts ranging from a
   contraction of current distributions by 7\% to an expansion of 60\%. A
   predicted net expansion in parasite distribution may expose naive lemur
   hosts to new parasites, which could have a profound effect on lemur
   health. Those parasites with the greatest potential for harmful effects
   are predicted to experience the largest expansion in range. Predicting
   these changing distributions will be critical for assessing population
   health, improving protected area design, preparing for reintroduction
   efforts and addressing potential parasite risk in lemurs, humans and
   domestic animals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Diurnal resting in brown lemurs in a dry deciduous forest, northwestern
   Madagascar: implications for seasonal thermoregulation},
Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {255-263},

Abstract = {Decreased activity has been reported in both nocturnal and diurnal
   primates during the prolonged dry season in western Madagascar, and this
   has been interpreted as a reaction to the severe environment, with its
   food scarcity and/or thermal stress. Several day-active lemurs rest more
   as trees defoliate, although the reason for this is unclear. To
   understand the mechanism underpinning the diurnal resting of lemurs in
   seasonal deciduous forests, I observed common brown lemurs (Eulemur
   fulvus fulvus) for one year in Ankarafantsika National Park,
   northwestern Madagascar. In Ankarafantsika, despite high fruit
   availability during the dry season, brown lemurs are known to engage in
   diurnal resting. To examine the effects of thermal factors and
   defoliation on lemur inactivity, I recorded the activity of a troop at 1
   min intervals, hourly ambient temperature, daily rainfall, and weather
   during observations (06:00-18:00). I quantified the amount of leaves
   biweekly for 680 trees. I tested correlations between percentages of
   resting time and each factor across hours during the day and across
   seasons. During the rainy season, resting time did not differ between
   sunny and cloudy days, and lemurs were active throughout the daytime. At
   the hourly level during the dry season, lemurs rested exclusively at
   midday, apparently at peak sunlight intensity rather than at peak
   ambient temperature. At seasonal level, percentages of total resting
   time from 08:00 to 16:00 were greater during dry season (81.9\%) than
   during rainy season (62.6\%), and percentages increased as ambient
   temperatures increased. Defoliation was related to seasonal decrease in
   weekly rainfall, which served as an index of water retained in the
   forest. Defoliation probably reflected aridification as well as the
   penetration of sunlight into the forest. Diurnal resting increased as
   both the amount of leaves and weekly rainfall decreased seasonally.
   These results suggest that heat stress under dry conditions may promote
   resting. Diurnal resting may function as behavioral thermoregulation to
   avoid overheating and to minimize water loss via excessive evaporative
   respiration.},

Abstract = {The structures of milk oligosaccharides were characterized for four
   strepsirrhine primates to examine the extent to which they resemble milk
   oligosaccharides in other primates. Neutral and acidic oligosaccharides
   were isolated from milk of the greater galago (Galagidae: Otolemur
   crassicaudatus), aye-aye (Daubentoniidae: Daubentonia madagascariensis),
   Coquerel's sifaka (Indriidae: Propithecus coquereli) and mongoose lemur
   (Lemuridae: Eulemur mongoz), and their chemical structures were
   characterized by H-1-NMR spectroscopy. The oligosaccharide patterns
   observed among strepsirrhines did not appear to correlate to phylogeny,
   sociality or pattern of infant care. Both type I and type II neutral
   oligosaccharides were found in the milk of the aye-aye, but type II
   predominate over type I. Only type II oligosaccharides were identified
   in other strepsirrhine milks. alpha 3'-GL (isoglobotriose, Gal(alpha
   1-3)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc) was found in the milks of Coquerel's sifaka and
   mongoose lemur, which is the first report of this oligosaccharide in the
   milk of any primate species. 2'-FL (Fuc(alpha 1-2)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc) was
   found in the milk of an aye-aye with an ill infant. Oligosaccharides
   containing the Lewis x epitope were found in aye-aye and mongoose lemur
   milk. Among acidic oligosaccharides, 3'-N-acetylneuraminyllactose
   (3'-SL-NAc, Neu5Ac(alpha 2-3)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc) was found in all studied
   species, whereas 6'-N-acetylneuraminyllactose (6'-SL-NAc, Neu5Ac(alpha
   2-6)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc) was found in all species except greater galago.
   Greater galago milk also contained 3'-N-glycolylneuraminyllactose
   (3'-SL-NGc, Neu5Gc(alpha 2-3)Gal(beta 1-4)Glc). The finding of a variety
   of neutral and acidic oligosaccharides in the milks of strepsirrhines,
   as previously reported for haplorhines, suggests that such constituents
   are ancient rather than derived features, and are as characteristic of
   primate lactation is the classic disaccharide, lactose.},

Abstract = {Aim We sought to quantify geographical variation in the stable isotope
   values of mouse lemurs (Microcebus) and to determine whether this
   variation reflects trophic differences among populations or baseline
   isotopic differences among habitats. If the latter pattern is
   demonstrated, then Microcebus can become a proxy for tracking baseline
   habitat isotopic variability. Establishing such a baseline is crucial
   for identifying niche partitioning in modern and ancient communities.
   Location We studied five species of Microcebus from eight distinct
   habitats across Madagascar.
   Methods We compared isotopic variation in C-3 plants and Microcebus fur
   within and among localities. We predicted that carbon and nitrogen
   isotope values of Microcebus should: (1) vary as a function of abiotic
   variables such as rainfall and temperature, and (2) covary with isotopic
   values in plants. We checked for trophic differences among Microcebus
   populations by comparing the average difference between mouse lemur and
   plant isotope values for each locality. We then used multiple regression
   models to explain spatial isotope variation in mouse lemurs, testing a
   suite of explanatory abiotic variables.
   Results We found substantial isotopic variation geographically. Ranges
   for mean isotope values were similar for both Microcebus and plants
   across localities (carbon 3.5-4.0 parts per thousand; nitrogen 10.5-11.0
   parts per thousand). Mean mouse lemur and plant isotope values were
   lowest in cool, moist localities and highest in hot, dry localities.
   Rainfall explained 58\% of the variation in Microcebus carbon isotope
   values, and mean plant nitrogen isotope values explained 99.7\% of the
   variation in Microcebus nitrogen isotope values. Average differences
   between mouse lemur and plant isotope values (carbon 5.0 parts per
   thousand; nitrogen 5.9 parts per thousand) were similar across
   localities.
   Main conclusions Isotopic data suggest that trophic differences among
   Microcebus populations were small. Carbon isotope values in mouse lemurs
   were negatively correlated with rainfall. Nitrogen isotope values in
   Microcebus and plants covaried. Such findings suggest that nitrogen
   isotope values for Microcebus are a particularly good proxy for tracking
   baseline isotopic differences among habitats. Our results will
   facilitate future comparative research on modern mouse lemur
   communities, and ecological interpretations of extinct Holocene
   communities.},

Title = {Home range size in the blue-eyed black lemur (Eulemur flavifrons): A
   comparison between dry and wet seasons},
Journal = {MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {76},
Number = {2},
Pages = {157-164},
Abstract = {Western Madagascar is subjected to a long, dry winter season which
   coincides with food scarcity. We investigated the effect of this
   seasonal variation in food availability on the home ranges of blue-eyed
   black lemurs (Eulemur flavifrons) in the Sahamalaza-Iles Radama National
   Park, north-western Madagascar. It was expected that home range would
   increase and overlap more in the dry season. The study was conducted in
   an area of dry rainforest from September 2006 to March 2008 with five
   lemur groups. Animals were located by direct observation and
   geographical locations recorded to determine the daily path length and
   the home range sizes of the study groups in the respective seasons.
   Daily path length and home range size varied significantly between
   seasons. Daily path length was significantly greater in the dry season
   (673.4 +/- 539.2 m) than in the wet season (423.6 +/- 183.2 m). Home
   ranges overlapped between groups in both seasons, but were significantly
   larger during the dry season (MCP: 7.5 +/- 6.6 ha, 95\% Kernel: 8.5 +/-
   6.6 ha) than in the wet season (MCP: 3.0 +/- 1.6 ha, 95\% Kernel: 4.1
   +/- 1.6 ha). There was no clear relationship between home range size and
   group size in either the dry or the wet season. Seasonal changes in home
   range area are likely to be a consequence of reduced food availability
   in the dry season. Compared to other primates, including some lemur
   species, the home range size of the blue-eyed black lemur is relatively
   small. (C) 2010 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published by

Title = {Methodological considerations in reserve system selection: A case study

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {143},
Number = {4},
Pages = {963-973},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Although data quality and weighting decisions impact the outputs of
   reserve selection algorithms, these factors have not been closely
   studied. We examine these methodological issues in the use of reserve
   selection algorithms by comparing. (1) quality of input data and (2) use
   of different weighting methods for prioritizing among species. In 2003,
   the government of Madagascar, a global biodiversity hotspot, committed
   to tripling the size of its protected area network to protect 10\% of
   the country's total land area We apply the Zonation reserve selection
   algorithm to distribution data for 52 lemur species to identify priority
   areas for the expansion of Madagascar's reserve network We assess the
   similarity of the areas selected, as well as the proportions of lemur
   ranges protected in the resulting areas when different forms of input
   data were used: extent of occurrence versus refined extent of
   occurrence. Low overlap between the areas selected suggests that refined
   extent of occurrence data are highly desirable, and to best protect
   lemur species, we recommend refining extent of occurrence ranges using
   habitat and altitude limitations Reserve areas were also selected for
   protection based on three different species weighting schemes, resulting
   in marked variation in proportional representation of species among the
   IUCN Red List of Threatened Species extinction risk categories This
   result demonstrates that assignment of species weights influences
   whether a reserve network prioritizes maximizing overall species
   protection or maximizing protection of the most threatened species. (C)

Abstract = {The critically endangered blue-eyed black lemur (Eulemur flavifrons) has
   one of the smallest distributions of any lemur, occurring only in the
   north-western forests of Madagascar. We report the results of a
   population estimate of this taxon in part of the Ankarafa Forest,
   Sahamalaza-Iles Radama National Park, a dry deciduous forest. We
   collected data between September 2007 and February 2008 using a total
   count method with marked individuals and known groups. In all, 228
   individuals comprising 29 groups were counted. Group sizes ranged from 4
   to 11 individuals with a mean of 8 +/- 1.8. We estimated population
   density to be 1.0 individual/ha or 97.3 individuals/km(2) for our study
   area, which is higher than previous estimates reported for Ankarafa and
   other sites within the Sahamalaza Peninsula. Our mean group size,
   however, was similar to those determined in previous studies. Both group
   size and density of the blue-eyed black lemur were higher within the

Abstract = {Health and nutritional assessments of wildlife are important management
   tools and can provide a means to evaluate ecosystem health. Such
   examinations were performed on 37 white-fronted brown lemurs (Eulemur
   fulvus albifrons) from four sites in Madagascar. Comparison of health
   parameters between sites revealed statistically significant differences
   in body weight, body temperature, respiratory rate, hematology
   parameters (white cell count, hematocrit, segmented neutrophil count,
   and lymphocyte count), serum chemistry parameters (aspartate
   aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, serum alkaline phosphatase,
   total protein, albumin, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, chloride, and
   creatinine phosphokinase), and nutrition parameters (copper, zinc,
   ferritin, retinol, tocopherol, and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol). Two of 10
   lemurs tested were positive for toxoplasmosis; none of 10 were positive
   for Cryptosporidium or Giardia. Enteric bacteria and endo- and
   ectoparasites were typical. Statistically different values in hematology
   and chemistry values probably do not reflect clinically significant
   differences, whereas nutrition parameter differences are likely related
   to season, soil, and forage availability.},

   structuring of the species. Here, we present the most comprehensive
   population genetic analysis of ring-tailed lemurs to date from across
   their likely remaining geographic range. We assessed levels of genetic
   diversity and population genetic structure using multilocus genotypes
   for 106 adult individuals from nine geographically representative
   localities. Population structure andF(ST)analyses revealed moderate
   genetic differentiation with localities being geographically partitioned
   into northern, southern, western and also potentially central clusters.
   Overall genetic diversity, in terms of allelic richness and observed
   heterozygosity, was high in the species (AR = 4.74,H-O = 0.811). In
   fact, it is the highest among all published lemur estimates to date.
   While these results are encouraging, ring-tailed lemurs are currently
   affected by ongoing habitat fragmentation and occur at lower densities
   in poorer quality habitats. The effects of continued isolation and
   fragmentation, coupled with climate-driven environmental instability,
   will therefore likely impede the long-term viability of the species.},

Title = {Gut Site and Gut Morphology Predict Microbiome Structure and Function in
   Ecologically Diverse Lemurs},
Journal = {MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {Most studies of wildlife gut microbiotas understandably rely on feces to
   approximate consortia along the gastrointestinal tract. We therefore
   compared microbiome structure and predicted metagenomic function in
   stomach, small intestinal, cecal, and colonic samples from 52 lemurs
   harvested during routine necropsies. The lemurs represent seven genera
   (Cheirogaleus, Daubentonia, Varecia, Hapalemur, Eulemur, Lemur,
   Propithecus) characterized by diverse feeding ecologies and gut
   morphologies. In particular, the hosts variably depend on fibrous
   foodstuffs and show correlative morphological complexity in their large
   intestines. Across host lineages, microbiome diversity, variability,
   membership, and function differed between the upper and lower gut,
   reflecting regional tradeoffs in available nutrients. These patterns
   related minimally to total gut length but were modulated by fermentation
   capacity (i.e., the ratio of small to large intestinal length).
   Irrespective of feeding strategy, host genera with limited fermentation
   capacity harbored more homogenized microbiome diversity along the gut,
   whereas those with expanded fermentation capacity harbored cecal and
   colonic microbiomes with greater diversity and abundant fermentative
   Ruminococcaceae taxa. While highlighting the value of curated sample
   repositories for retrospective comparisons, our results confirm that the
   need to survive on fibrous foods, either routinely or in hypervariable
   environments, can shape the morphological and microbial features of the
   lower gut.},

Title = {Habitat use by the island lemurs of Nosy Be, Madagascar},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {84},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Madagascar's lemurs are threatened by forest loss, fragmentation, and
   degradation. Many species use flexible behaviors to survive in degraded
   habitat, but their ability to persist in very small areas may be
   limited. Insular lemurs, like those found on Nosy Be, an island off the
   northwestern coast of Madagascar, are at heightened risk of sudden
   population declines and extirpation. Nosy Be is home to two Critically
   Endangered species-the endemic Nosy Be sportive lemur (Lepilemur
   tymerlachsoni) and Claire's mouse lemur (Microcebus mamiratra)-as well
   as the Endangered black lemur (Eulemur macaco). Most of the remaining
   forest on Nosy Be is protected by the 862-ha Lokobe National Park. To
   document how Nosy Be lemurs use their restricted habitat, we conducted
   vegetation and reconnaissance surveys on 53 transects in and around
   Lokobe. We collected data on tree size, canopy cover, understory
   visibility, and elevation for 248 lemur sightings. We used a spatially
   explicit, multi-species occupancy model to investigate which
   forest-structure variables are important to lemurs. Our results
   represent some of the first data on habitat use by insular lemurs. Black
   lemurs preferred significantly larger trees and areas with less dense
   understory. They also occurred significantly less outside of Lokobe
   National Park, even when accounting for sampling effort and geography.
   The distributions of the sportive and mouse lemurs were not related to
   the forest structure variables we documented, but they did negatively
   predict each other-perhaps because their habitat requirements differ.
   These results also underscore the importance of the national park to
   protecting the black lemur population on Nosy Be and raise questions
   about what factors do influence the distribution of Nosy Be's smaller
   lemurs. Close monitoring is needed to prevent these populations and the
   ecosystem services they provide from disappearing, as have other island
   lemurs.},

Title = {Seasonal Variations in Lemur Edge Proximity in South-Eastern Madagascar},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Abstract = {Edge effects are caused by the penetration of abiotic and biotic
   conditions from the nonforest matrix into forest interiors. Edge effects
   are particularly relevant to studies of lemur conservation biogeography
   due to the high levels of forest loss and fragmentation on Madagascar.
   Moreover, climatic seasonality has influenced many aspects of lemur
   evolutionary ecology (e.g., diet and ranging patterns). Although lemurs
   are strongly influenced by seasonality and edge habitats are an
   increasingly dominant feature of their forest habitats, there are few
   data on whether or not any species exhibit seasonal responses to edge
   effects. In this study, we evaluated for the first time whether four
   lemur species (Avahi peyrierasi, Eulemur rubriventer, Hapalemur griseus
   ranomafanensis, and Microcebus sp.) exhibited seasonal variations in
   their edge proximities in SE Madagascar. We conducted diurnal (N = 348)
   and nocturnal (N = 134) lemur surveys along six transects over 3 years
   in the Vohibola III Classified Forest. The four lemur species exhibited
   considerable interspecific differences in the overall distribution and
   shape of their seasonal edge proximities. A. peyrierasi aggregated
   significantly further away from the forest edge during the warm, wet
   season than during the cool, dry season. The combination of a highly
   selected diet in A. peyrierasi and anthropogenic depletion of their
   preferred food and sleeping trees in edge habitats may explain seasonal
   changes in edge proximity. Lack of a seasonal edge effect in the other
   three lemur species likely reflects their ecological flexibility and in
   H. g. ranomafanensis and E. rubriventer, active defense of home-ranges
   and territories, respectively, from conspecifics. Further research is
   needed to better understand this new described pattern of seasonal
   variations in edge responses in lemurs.},

Title = {Environmental drivers of Cheirogaleidae population density: Remarkable
   resilience of Madagascar's smallest lemurs to habitat degradation},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Aim Global animal populations are in decline due to destruction and
   degradation of their natural habitat. Understanding the factors that
   determine the distribution and density of threatened animal populations
   is therefore now a crucial component of their study and conservation.
   The Cheirogaleidae are a diverse family of small-bodied, nocturnal
   lemurs that are widespread throughout the forests of Madagascar.
   However, many cheirogaleid lemurs are now highly threatened with
   extinction and the environmental factors that determine their
   distribution and population density are still little known. Here, I
   investigated the environmental drivers of Cheirogaleidae population
   density at genus level.
   Location Various forest sites across Madagascar.
   Methods I investigated how six environmental variables affect
   Cheirogaleidae population density at the genus level via random-effect
   meta-analyses. I then used a generalized linear mixed-effects model to
   identify the primary predictors of Cheirogaleidae population density.
   Finally, I investigated how the population density of this family of
   lemurs varies between protected and unprotected areas of Madagascar via
   a GLM analysis.
   Results My results indicate that the relationships between the tested
   environmental factors and population density are genus-specific among
   the Cheirogaleidae. Rather remarkably, the density of Microcebus appears
   to have a profoundly positive relationship with anthropogenic
   disturbance and a negative relationship with forest cover, a finding
   that is also reflected by larger population densities within unprotected
   areas in comparison with localities within Madagascar's protected area
   network.
   Main Conclusions The results of this study are highly encouraging for
   the conservation of the Cheirogaleidae and highlight the remarkable
   resilience of these lemurs to habitat degradation and anthropogenic
   activity. However, this study also outlines the dearth of knowledge that
   we have for many species, and why these data are urgently needed to
   understand the biogeography and ecology of threatened animal populations
   and implement successful conservation.},

Title = {Exploratory analysis reveals arthropod consumption in 10 lemur species
   using DNA metabarcoding},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {83},
Number = {6, SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Arthropods (insects, spiders, etc.) can fulfill major nutritional
   requirements for primates, particularly in terms of proteins, fats,
   vitamins, and minerals. Yet, for many primate species we know very
   little about the frequency and importance of arthropod consumption.
   Traditional methods for arthropod prey identification, such as
   behavioral observations and fecal dissections, offer limited taxonomic
   resolution and, as a result, underestimate true diversity. Metabarcoding
   arthropod DNA from primate fecal samples provides a promising but
   underused alternative. Here, we inventoried arthropod prey diversity in
   wild lemurs by sequencing two regions of the CO1 gene. Samples were
   collected opportunistically from 10 species of lemurs inhabiting three
   national parks in southern Madagascar using a combination of focal
   animal follows and live trapping. In total, we detected arthropod DNA in
   98 of the 170 fecal samples analyzed. Although all lemur species
   included in these analyses showed evidence of arthropod consumption,
   those within the family Cheirogaleidae appeared to consume the highest
   frequency and diversity of arthropods. To our knowledge, this study
   presents the first evidence of arthropod consumption in Phaner
   pallescens, Avahi peyrierasi, and Propithecus verreauxi, and identifies
   32 families of arthropods as probable food items that have not been
   published as lemur dietary items to date. Our study emphasizes the
   importance of arthropods as a nutritional source and the role DNA
   metabarcoding can play in elucidating an animal's diet.},

Abstract = {Eight species of ectoparasites were collected during 225 gray mouse
   lemur, Microcebus murinus (J. F. Miller), captures, in Ankarafantsika
   National Park, Madagascar, in 2010-2011. The ixodid tick, Haemaphysalis
   lemuris Hoogstraal, was the most common ectoparasite and was mostly
   represented by nymphs. Other ectoparasites recorded include the
   polyplacid sucking louse, Lemurpediculus madagascariensis Durden,
   Kessler, Radespiel, Zimmermann, Hasiniaina, and Zohdy; the ixodid tick,
   Haemaphysalis simplex Neumann; an undescribed laelapid mite in the genus
   Aetholaelaps; another laelapid belonging to the genus Androlaelaps; the
   chigger mite Schoutedenichia microcebi Stekolnikov; an undescribed
   species of atopomelid mite in the genus Listrophoroides; and an
   undescribed species of psoroptid mite in the genus Cheirogalalges.
   Except for the 2 species of ticks and 1 species of chigger, these
   ectoparasites may be host-specific to M. murinus. Total tick (H. lemuris
   and H. simplex) infestation was significantly greater in August than
   October, whereas louse (L. madagascariensis) infestation was
   significantly greater in October. There was no significant difference in
   tick infestations between male and female lemurs, but male lemurs had
   significantly more lice than female lemurs. Reproductive status was not
   a significant predictor of tick infestation in males and females.},

Title = {The lemur baseline: how lemurs compare to monkeys and apes in the
   Primate Cognition Test Battery},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 24},
Abstract = {Primates have relatively larger brains than other mammals even though
   brain tissue is energetically costly. Comparative studies of variation
   in cognitive skills allow testing of evolutionary hypotheses addressing
   socioecological factors driving the evolution of primate brain size.
   However, data on cognitive abilities for meaningful interspecific
   comparisons are only available for haplorhine primates (great apes, Old-
   and New World monkeys) although strepsirrhine primates (lemurs and
   lorises) serve as the best living models of ancestral primate cognitive
   skills, linking primates to other mammals. To begin filling this gap, we
   tested members of three lemur species (Microcebus murinus, Varecia
   variegata, Lemur catta) with the Primate Cognition Test Battery, a
   comprehensive set of experiments addressing physical and social
   cognitive skills that has previously been used in studies of
   haplorhines. We found no significant differences in cognitive
   performance among lemur species and, surprisingly, their average
   performance was not different from that of haplorhines in many aspects.
   Specifically, lemurs' overall performance was inferior in the physical
   domain but matched that of haplorhines in the social domain. These
   results question a clear-cut link between brain size and cognitive
   skills, suggesting a more domain-specific distribution of cognitive
   abilities in primates, and indicate more continuity in cognitive
   abilities across primate lineages than previously thought.},

Title = {Logical inferences from visual and auditory information in ruffed lemurs
   and sifakas},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {164},
Pages = {193-204},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Inference by exclusion, or the ability to select a correct course of
   action by systematically excluding other potential alternatives, is a
   form of logical inference that allows individuals to solve problems
   without complete information. Current comparative research shows that
   several bird, mammal and primate species can find hidden food through
   inference by exclusion. Yet there is also wide variation in how
   successful different species are as well as the kinds of sensory
   information they can use to do so. An important question is therefore
   why some species are better at engaging in logical inference than
   others. Here, we investigate the evolution of logical reasoning
   abilities by comparing strepsirrhine primate species that vary in
   dietary ecology: frugivorous ruffed lemurs (Varecia spp.) and folivorous
   Coquerel's sifakas, Propithecus coquereli. Across two studies, we
   examined their abilities to locate food using direct information versus
   inference from exclusion and using both visual and auditory information.
   In study 1, we assessed whether these lemurs could make inferences when
   full visual and auditory information about the two potential locations
   of food were provided. In study 2, we then compared their ability to
   make direct inferences versus inferences by exclusion in both the visual
   and auditory domains. We found that these lemur species can use visual
   information to find food, but that only ruffed lemurs were also able to
   use auditory cues, mirroring differences in the complexity of their wild
   ecology. We further found that, unlike many anthropoid species tested to
   date, these strepsirrhine species failed to make inferences by
   exclusion. These results highlight the importance of natural history in
   understanding the evolution of logical inference and help reconstruct
   the deeper phylogeny of primate cognition. (c) 2020 The Association for

Title = {Realized distribution patterns of crowned lemurs (Eulemur coronatus)
   within a human-dominated forest fragment in northern Madagascar},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Due to the impact of anthropogenic activities on forest extent and
   integrity across Madagascar, it is increasingly necessary to assess how
   endangered lemur populations inhabiting human-dominated forest fragments
   can effectively sustain themselves ecologically. Our research addresses
   this concern by exploring how the distribution patterns of a small
   population of crowned lemurs (Eulemur coronatus), occupying a degraded
   forest fragment at Oronjia Forest New Protected Area in northern
   Madagascar, are impacted by the availability of key ecological and
   anthropogenic factors. We hypothesize that the distribution of E.
   coronatus within the fragment is limited by the availability of critical
   ecological resources and conditions and the intensity of anthropogenic
   features and activities. To examine this, we used MaxEnt to develop a
   species distribution model using presence-only occurrence records and 10
   independent background covariates detailing the site's ecological and
   anthropogenic aspects. The results indicate that the realized
   distribution patterns of E. coronatus within human-dominated forest
   fragments are strongly associated with sections of forest that contain
   sparsely and sporadically distributed resources, such as freshwater and
   continuous hardwood vegetation. We conclude that the distribution of E.
   coronatus at Oronjia is shaped by their need to maximize foraging
   opportunities in a degraded forest landscape where they are subject to
   both environmental and anthropogenic stressors.},

Abstract = {The recognition that much biodiversity exists outside protected areas is
   driving research to understand how animals survive in anthropogenic
   landscapes. In Madagascar, cacao (Theobroma cacao) is grown under a mix
   of native and exotic shade trees, and this study sought to understand

   2016 and March 2017, discussions with farmers, nocturnal reconnaissance
   surveys and camera traps were used to confirm the presence of lemurs in
   the Cokafa and Mangabe plantations near Ambanja, north-west Madagascar.
   Four species of lemur were encountered in nocturnal surveys: Mirza zaza,
   Phaner parienti, Microcebussp. and Cheirogaleussp. with encounter rates
   of 1.2, 0.4, 0.4 and 0.3 individuals/km, respectively. The presence of
   Lepilemur dorsalis was confirmed by camera trap. This is the first time
   lemurs have been studied in cacao plantations, and understanding how
   these threatened animals use anthropogenic landscapes is vital for their

Title = {Lemur catta in small forest fragments: Which variables best predict
   population viability?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Number = {4, SI},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Habitat fragmentation is an increasingly serious issue affecting
   primates in most regions where they are found today. Populations of
   Lemur catta (ring-tailed lemur) in Madagascar's south-central region are
   increasingly restricted to small, isolated forest fragments, surrounded
   by grasslands or small-scale agriculture. Our aim was to evaluate the
   potential for population viability of L. catta in nine forest fragments
   of varying sizes (2-46 ha, population range: 6-210 animals) in
   south-central Madagascar, using a set of comparative, quantitative
   ecological measures. We used Poisson regression models with a log link
   function to examine the effects of fragment size, within-fragment food
   availability, and abundance of matrix resources (food and water sources)
   on L. catta population sizes and juvenile recruitment. We found a strong
   association between overall population size and (a) fragment size and
   (b) abundance of key food resources Melia azedarach and Ficus spp. (per
   100 m along transect lines). Juvenile recruitment was also associated
   with fragment size and abundance of the two above-mentioned food
   resources. When the largest population, an outlier, was removed from the
   analysis, again, the model containing fragment size and abundance of M.
   azedarach and Ficus spp. was the best fitting, but the model that best
   predicted juvenile recruitment contained only fragment size. While our
   results are useful for predicting population presence and possible
   persistence in these fragments, both the potential for male dispersal
   and the extent of human disturbance within most fragments play crucial
   roles regarding the likelihood of long-term L. catta survival. While
   seven of the nine fragments were reasonably protected from human
   disturbance, only three offered the strong potential for male dispersal,
   thus the long-term viability of many of these populations is highly
   uncertain.},

Title = {Trends in forest fragment research in Madagascar: Documented responses
   by lemurs and other taxa},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},

Abstract = {The rise in research investigating fragmentation and its impact on
   primates and other taxa reflects the growing presence of fragmented
   landscapes themselves. Although numerous studies report the negative
   effects of fragmentation on biodiversity, it is difficult to generalize
   responses to fragmentation for specific taxonomic groups, such as
   non-human primates, when studies have not employed a definitive concept
   of fragmentation or fragments themselves. Madagascar's high degree of
   fragmentation, wealth of endemic taxa, and extensive history of
   ecological research provide the opportunity to compare fragmentation
   studies across similar contexts. We conducted a literature search of
   peer-reviewed articles on fragmentation in Madagascar to characterize
   its trends. A total of 70 articles, 46 of which concentrated on lemurs,
   tested the impacts of fragmentation on Malagasy taxa, while additional
   sources conducted research in one or more fragments without testing its
   effects (n = 112 total, 79 on lemurs). Studies on lemurs most frequently
   tested fragmentation's impacts on genetics and biodiversity metrics (n =
   16 and 15 studies, respectively), although health, modeling, behavioral,
   and cross-disciplinary techniques were also reported. Responses to
   fragmentation were reported for 49 lemur species, with most studies
   concentrated in eastern Madagascar (87\%). Although there was variation
   in the metrics reported in studies testing the effects of fragmentation
   on Malagasy species, the most common measures were fragment area,
   isolation, or comparison to a control site. Landscape-scale approaches
   and examination of fragmentation per se were rarely employed.
   Characterizing trends of fragmentation research in Madagascar emphasizes
   the challenges of documenting fragmentation's effects while highlighting
   the benefits of research within fragmented landscapes, particularly when
   combined with consideration for how the matrix within human-modified
   landscapes may impact primate populations.},

Abstract = {We provide a preliminary case study in red-bellied lemurs (Eulemur
   rubriventer) to illustrate a multimodal approach to understanding
   communication strategies within a species with obligate pair-bonds. From
   June to August 2012, we observed and analyzed signaling behaviors across
   three established red-bellied lemur pairs at Duke Lemur Center (Durham,
   NC, USA). Our aim was to assess how individuals combine signal
   modalities to communicate with pair-mates, and to determine whether
   these strategies vary by time of day, sex, or pair. We analyzed rates of
   occurrence of touch (allogrooming, mutual grooming, physical contact,
   and huddling), scent (scent marking and allomarking), and sound
   (close-distance contact calls) using Wilcoxon rank sum and exact
   binomial tests. Time of day impacted rates of occurrence across signal
   modalities, with higher rates of combined signaling within each modality
   occurring earlier in the day (p < 0.03). Across time periods, all pairs
   used auditory signals most frequently, followed by olfactory signals,
   and finally tactile and tactile-olfactory signals (p < 0.01, all
   comparisons). In fact, auditory signals frequently overlapped the
   olfactory signaling modality, and travel rarely occurred without
   accompanying vocalizations. However, red-bellied lemurs spent the
   highest percentage of their observed time in tactile signaling bouts (on
   average, 19.5\% of total observed time across pairs). Males and females
   participated equally in most signaling behaviors (p > 0.1), with the
   exception of scent marking, which males used more frequently (p < 0.01).
   The results of this study will aid in developing methods and hypotheses
   to determine how wild red-bellied lemurs communicate to form, maintain,
   and advertise their pair-bonds.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},

Volume = {81},
Number = {10-11, SI},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Deforestation continues to jeopardize Malagasy primates as viable
   habitats become smaller, more fragmented, and more disturbed. This
   deforestation can lead to changes in diet, microhabitat, and gene flow
   between populations of endangered species, and it remains unclear how
   these changes may affect gut microbiome (GM) characteristics. The
   black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata), which is among
   Madagascar's most threatened lemur species, provides a critical model
   for understanding the relationships between historical and on-going
   deforestation (habitat disturbance), feeding ecology, and GM composition
   and diversity. We studied four populations inhabiting two rainforests
   (relatively pristine vs. highly disturbed) in southeastern Madagascar.
   We conducted full-day focal animal behavioral follows and collected
   fecal samples opportunistically across a three-month period. Our results
   indicate that lemurs inhabiting sites characterized by habitat
   disturbance and low dietary diversity exhibited reduced gut microbial
   alpha diversity. We also show that these same factors were associated
   with high community dissimilarity using weighted and unweighted UniFrac
   metrics. Finally, an indicator species analysis showed that the most
   pristine site was characterized by an abundance of methanogenic archaea.
   While it is impossible to disentangle the relative contributions of each
   confounding variable presented by our sampling design, these results
   provide crucial information about GM variability, thereby underscoring
   the importance of monitoring endangered species at the population-level.},

Abstract = {The brown lemur population (Eulemur fulvus spp.) in Mbouzi islet is not
   native, and was introduced in 1997. Since then, the population has
   grown. In 2012 the National Council for Protection of Nature of Mayotte
   requested to remove this population of lemurs from Mbouzi, as they were
   suspected to be a threat to the protected endemic flora of the islet.
   The Association Francophone des Veterinaires de Parcs Zoologiques
   (French-speaking Zoo Veterinarians Association, AFVPZ) was asked to
   conduct a biomedical evaluation of the population. Fifty-two animals
   were captured, anesthetized, and weighed. They all underwent a general
   physical examination. Feces were sampled for bacterial and
   parasitological screening. Hair was sampled for genetic studies and
   blood was sampled for hematology, biochemistry, viral serology, and
   haemoparasitology. Results showed that three individuals had a positive
   feces culture for Salmonella enterica and six had Lemuricola or
   Callistoura parasite infestations. Blood analyses for hematology and
   biochemistry showed 46 animals with elevated transferrin, 42 with low
   ferritin levels, 19 with hyperglycemia, and 10 with neutrophilia.
   Finally, 10 were positive for Toxoplasma serology, one was positive for
   a herpesvirus, five for pox virus, five for simian virus 40, and two for
   flavivirus. This publication reports the first complete biomedical
   evaluation of lemurs on Mayotte Island.},

Title = {Sleep influences cognitive performance in lemurs},
Journal = {ANIMAL COGNITION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {5},
Pages = {697-706},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Primates spend almost half their lives asleep, yet little is known about
   how sleep influences their waking cognition. We hypothesized that
   diurnal and cathemeral lemurs differ in their need for consistent,
   non-segmented sleep for next-day cognitive function-including long-term
   memory consolidation, self-control, foraging efficiency, and sociality.
   Specifically, we expected that strictly diurnal Propithecus is more
   reliant on uninterrupted sleep for cognitive performance, as compared to
   four other lemur species that are more flexibly active (i.e.,
   cathemeral). We experimentally inhibited sleep and tested next-day
   performance in 30 individuals of 5 lemur species over 960 total nights
   at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, North Carolina. Each set of
   pair-housed lemurs experienced a sleep restriction and/or deprivation
   protocol and was subsequently tested in a variety of fitness-relevant
   cognitive tasks. Within-subject comparisons of performance on these
   tasks were made by switching the pair from the experimental sleep
   inhibited condition to a normal sleep environment, thus ensuring
   cognitive equivalency among individuals. We validated effectiveness of
   the protocol via actigraphy and infrared videography. Our results
   suggest that `normal' non-disrupted sleep improved memory consolidation
   for all lemurs. Additionally, on nights of normal sleep, diurnal lemurs
   performed better in foraging efficiency tasks than cathemeral lemurs.
   Social behaviors changed in species-specific ways after exposure to
   experimental conditions, and self-control was not significantly linked
   with sleep condition. Based on these findings, the links between sleep,
   learning, and memory consolidation appear to be evolutionarily conserved
   in primates.},

Abstract = {The ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), one of the most iconic and widely
   recognized primates in the world, is threatened in its native range and
   classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of
   Nature. The global conservation strategy for the species includes ex
   situ conservation efforts led by zoological institutions in the
   framework of regional captive breeding programs. To maximize the
   conservation of genetic diversity and optimize breeding programs, an
   accurate pedigree must be established in captive populations. Our study
   documents the formation and subsequent monitoring of a large ring-tailed
   lemur group in a French zoological institution. Based on staff's
   behavioral observations and DNA analyses using 11 microsatellite
   markers, we were able to document the survival and reproduction rates of
   the lemurs in this situation and reconstruct the pedigree of infants
   born in the institution. In total, 22 of the 28 imported animals as well
   as 4 locally born individuals gave birth to 58 infants of which 28
   survived. The consistent genotypes obtained from the 53 sampled animals
   allowed us to identify 25 of the sires and 27 of the dams for the 28
   surviving infants. A total of 12 different females and 14 different
   males produced the 28 surviving infants, suggesting that no individual
   dominates reproduction. This pioneering study has practical applications
   for the captive management of the species, which can be raised to the
   individual level instead of the group level.},

Title = {Illegal Trade of Wild-Captured Lemur catta within Madagascar},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {90},

Pages = {199-214},
Abstract = {Lemur catta is the most reported illegal captive lemur. We document 286
   L. catta that were held in illegal captive conditions in Madagascar.
   Coastal tourist destinations are ``hot spots{''} for sightings. Many of
   the L. catta reported were in businesses (49\%) and were perceived to be
   held captive for the purpose of generating income (41\%). Infant/
   juvenile L. catta were overwhelmingly observed annually in December
   (41\%) and may suffer high mortality rates given that they are not
   weaned during this month of the year. Population growth modeling
   suggests that known capture rates may be sustainable in all but small
   populations of 500 individuals and when infants/juveniles are targeted.
   However, of the seven remaining populations of L. catta with more than
   100 individuals, only one is known to contain more than 500 animals, and
   we present evidence here that infants/juveniles are targeted. Moreover
   L. catta face significant other threats including habitat loss, bushmeat
   hunting, and climate change. Several actions could reduce the illegal
   capture and ownership of L. catta in Madagascar such as tourist behavior
   change initiatives, enforcement of laws, and alternative livelihoods for
   local people. These interventions are urgently needed and could be
   adapted to protect other exploited wildlife in the future. (C) 2019 S.

Title = {Spacing and Mate Attraction: Sex-Specific Function of Advertisement
   Calls in the Northern Giant Mouse Lemur (Mirza zaza)},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {90},
Number = {5},
Pages = {361-378},
Abstract = {It has been proposed that primates use advertisement calls exclusively
   to negotiate spacing, but the function of female calls has rarely been
   studied. Here, we investigated the function of male and female
   advertisement calls in the northern giant mouse lemur (Mirza zaza),a
   non-gregarious nocturnal primate from north-western Madagascar. We
   recorded advertisement calls and associated behaviours of 35 M. zaza
   individuals at the Duke University Lemur Center. We found that females
   of M. zazaexclusively use their advertisement calls to advertise
   oestrus. In contrast, male advertisement calls appeared to be used in a
   spacing context. These findings show that primates can use their
   advertisement calls for both spacing and mate attraction, and that the
   sexes may differ in how they use these calls. The novel find of females
   of M. zazaattracting mates with loud advertisement calls contrasts with
   many non-primate taxa, where acoustic mate attraction is usually a
   function of male advertisement calls, and with other primates, where
   females use visual and olfactory cues to attract males. The loud female
   advertisement calls of M. zaza likely ensure mating success during the
   short receptive phase in this non-gregariously foraging, nocturnal
   primate. (c) 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {Apes and some New and Old World monkeys (i.e., haplorhine primates) are
   known to routinely use tools. In strepsirrhine primates (i.e., lemurs
   and lorises), no tool use has been reported, even though they appear to
   have some basic understanding of the spatial relations required for
   using a pulling tool. To facilitate direct comparisons of the underlying
   abilities between haplorhine and strepsirrhine primate species, we
   experimentally examined instrumental problem-solving abilities in three
   captive lemur species (Microcebus murinus, Varecia variegata, and Lemur
   catta), using methods from previous experiments with haplorhine
   primates. First, lemurs were supposed to use a stick to gain access to
   an inaccessible food reward. Only one ring-tailed lemur solved this task
   spontaneously on the first attempt. After offering the stick repeatedly,
   13 individuals of all three species solved it successfully. Second,
   lemurs had to choose between pairs of reachable objects with a food
   reward on or near them, where one object did not afford pulling in the
   food. Ring-tailed and gray mouse lemurs generally selected the correct
   (connected) object, thus performing comparably with haplorhine primates,
   and ruffed lemurs even matched chimpanzees in their performance. Thus,
   although strepsirrhine primates may lack the fine motor skills to use a
   stick as a reaching tool, they performed comparable with naturally
   tool-using haplorhine primates on means-end problems. Our findings
   suggest a dissociation in primates between the judgment of spatial
   relations between two objects, which appears to be roughly equivalent
   across species, and facility at handling sticks for instrumental
   purposes, which favors species with enhanced manual dexterity.},

Abstract = {Forest loss, fragmentation, and anthropization threaten the survival of
   forest species all over the world. Shifting agriculture is one of these
   threatening processes in Madagascar. However, when its cycle is halted
   and the land is left to regenerate, the resulting growth of secondary
   forest may provide a viable habitat for folivorous and omnivorous lemur
   species. We aimed to identify the response of nocturnal lemurs to
   different successional stages of regenerating secondary, degraded
   mature, and mature forest across a mosaic-type landscape. We surveyed
   four nocturnal lemur species (Avahi laniger, Microcebus cf. simmonsi,
   Allocebus trichotis, and Daubentonia madagascariensis) in four forest
   types of varying habitat disturbance in northeastern Madagascar. We
   estimated densities in mature and regenerating secondary forest for the
   eastern woolly lemur (Avahi laniger) and mouse lemur (Microcebus cf.
   simmonsi), two sympatric species with folivorous and omnivorous diets
   respectively. We did not estimate densities of Allocebus trichotis and
   Daubentonia madagascariensis owing to small sample size; however, we
   observed both species exclusively in mature forest. We found higher
   population densities of A. laniger and M. cf. simmonsi in secondary than
   in mature forest, showing the potential of regenerating secondary forest
   for lemur conservation. Several environmental factors influenced the
   detectability of the two lemur species. While observer and habitat type
   influenced detection of the eastern woolly lemur, canopy height and vine
   density influenced detection of mouse lemurs. Understanding how
   different species with different diets interact with anthropogenically
   impacted habitat will aid future management decisions for the
   conservation of primate species.},

Title = {The cost of deep sleep: Environmental influences on sleep regulation are

Volume = {166},
Number = {3, SI},

Abstract = {ObjectivesPrimates spend almost half their lives asleep, yet we know
   little about how evolution has shaped variation in the duration or
   intensity of sleep (i.e., sleep regulation) across primate species. Our
   objective was to test hypotheses related to how sleeping site security
   influences sleep intensity in different lemur species.
   MethodsWe used actigraphy and infrared videography to generate sleep
   measures in 100 individuals (males=51, females=49) of seven lemur
   species (genera: Eulemur, Lemur, Propithecus, and Varecia) at the Duke
   Lemur Center in Durham, NC. We also generated experimental data using
   sleep deprivation for 16 individuals. This experiment used a pair-wise
   design for two sets of paired lemurs from each genus, where the
   experimental pair experienced a sleep deprivation protocol while the
   control experienced normal sleeping conditions. We calculated a sleep
   depth composite metric from weighted z scores of three sleep intensity
   variables.
   ResultsWe found that, relative to cathemeral lemurs, diurnal Propithecus
   was characterized by the deepest sleep and exhibited the most
   disruptions to normal sleep-wake regulation when sleep deprived. In
   contrast, Eulemur mongoz was characterized by significantly lighter
   sleep than Propithecus, and E. mongoz showed the fewest disruptions to
   normal sleep-wake regulation when sleep deprived. Security of the
   sleeping site led to greater sleep depth, with access to outdoor housing
   linked to lighter sleep in all lemurs that were studied.
   ConclusionsWe propose that sleeping site security was an essential
   component of sleep regulation throughout primate evolution. This work
   suggests that sleeping site security may have been an important factor
   associated with the evolution of sleep in early and later hominins.},

Abstract = {Coquerel's sifakas (Propithecus coquereli) are diurnal, folivorous
   lemurs native to Madagascar and one of only two members of the genus
   Propithecus currently housed in human care settings outside of
   Madagascar. This species has a lifespan of approximately 30 yr but
   minimal information exists regarding morbidity and mortality in human
   care settings. In this retrospective study, medical records, postmortem
   exam, and autopsy reports from 56 animals housed at the Duke Lemur
   Center from 1990 to 2015 were evaluated. Mortality assessments included
   age, sex, time of year, histopathological findings, major organ system
   impacted, and etiological factors. Mortality was most prevalent among
   adults greater than 2 yr of age (42.9\%) and neonates less than 7 days
   of age (30.4\%). The top four morphological diagnoses accounted for
   51.7\% of all deaths and included stillbirths (19.6\%),
   enteritis-colitis (12.5\%), failure to thrive (10.7\%), and systemic
   protozoal infections (8.9\%). The two most commonly affected organ
   systems in animals over 7 days of age were multisystem disease (30.8\%)
   and the gastrointestinal system (28.2\%). Infections were the most
   common etiology with bacterial being the most prevalent followed by
   protozoal infections. The results provide insight into common causes of
   mortality of this species and can be used to guide management of this

Abstract = {The discovery and characterization of emerging tick-borne organisms are
   critical for global health initiatives to improve animal and human
   welfare (One Health). It is possible that unknown tick-borne organisms
   underlie a subset of undiagnosed illness in wildlife, domesticated
   species, and humans. Our study lends support to the One Health concept
   by highlighting the prevalence of three blood-borne organisms in wild
   lemurs living in close proximity to domesticated species and humans.
   Previously, our team identified three novel, presumably tick-borne,
   intravascular organisms, belonging to the genera Babesia, Borrelia, and
   Neoehrlichia, circulating in two of Madagascar's lemur species. Here, we
   extend our previous observation by developing a targeted molecular
   surveillance approach aimed at determining the prevalence of these
   organisms in lemurs. Using quantitative PCR, we provide Babesia,
   Borrelia, and Neoehrlichia prevalence data for 76 individuals comprising
   four lemur species located in eastern Madagascar. Our results indicate a
   high prevalence (96\%) of Babesia across sampled individuals with lower
   prevalences for Neoehrlichia (36\%) and Borrelia (14.5\%). In light of
   our results, we recommend additional studies of these tick-borne
   organisms to determine pathogenicity and assess zoonotic potency to
   other animals and humans in Madagascar.},

Title = {AGE-RELATED CHANGES IN HEMATOLOGY AND BLOOD BIOCHEMISTRY VALUES IN
   ENDANGERED, WILD RING-TAILED LEMURS (LEMUR CATTA) AT THE BEZA MAHAFALY

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The health of 44 wild ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) at the Beza
   Mahafaly Special Reserve was assessed across three age classes: <5 yr
   (young), 5-9 yr (adult), and >= 10 yr (old). Hematology and biochemistry
   tests were performed manually (leukocyte count and differential, packed
   cell volume, total protein) and using a point-of-care analyzer
   (hematocrit, hemoglobin, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine,
   sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, total carbon dioxide,
   anion gap), respectively. Urine specific gravity was measured via
   refractometry. Age- and sex-related differences were detected. Old
   lemurs had significantly lower lymphocyte count than adult and young
   lemurs, leading to markedly lower total leukocyte count and higher
   neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Decreased lymphocyte count with advanced
   age is consistent with immunosenescence. Young lemurs had significantly
   higher total protein, monocyte count, and potassium than adult and old
   lemurs but significantly lower ionized calcium than adult lemurs. Males
   had significantly higher leukocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte counts;
   lower percentage basophils; and higher blood urea nitrogen than females.
   Females had markedly higher glucose than males. Young females had the
   highest monocyte count and total protein, which were significantly lower
   in the adult and old age classes. Basophil count was stable in females
   across age but dropped precipitously in males in the adult and old age
   classes. Within adult and old age classes, males had significantly
   higher blood urea nitrogen and lower basophils than females. Glucose was
   significantly higher after alpha 2 agonist administration. Identifying
   age-related hematologic and biochemical changes in apparently healthy
   wild ringtailed lemurs will aid in clinical diagnosis and treatment of
   lemurs in human care, which is especially relevant for management of
   geriatric animals in zoo populations. Equally important, a better
   understanding of the ability of aging lemurs to tolerate environmental
   stressors will inform the capacity for this species to cope with ongoing
   and future habitat alteration.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {132},

Abstract = {Play fighting is a commonly reported form of play that involves
   competitive interactions that generally do not escalate to serious
   fighting. Although in many species what are competed over are the body
   targets that are bitten or struck in serious fighting, for many others,
   the competition can be over other forms of contact, such as sex, social
   grooming, and predation. In primates, the most detailed studies have
   been of species such as Old World monkeys, that engage in play fighting
   that simulates serious fighting, but reports of a number of others,
   especially among nocturnal prosimians, have noted that play fighting can
   also involve simulation of sex and grooming. The present study on
   captive born gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) provides a
   quantitative assessment of the relative engagement by juveniles in play
   fighting involving agonistic and amicable targets. About 80\% of play
   fighting involves competing to groom or mount one another, with a
   minority involving competing to bite. That these forms of play fighting
   may be distinct from one another is suggested by the finding that attack
   on one target does not lead to counterattack on another. The findings
   are discussed in terms of the evolution and mechanisms underlying play
   fighting in primates and more widely among animals.},

Title = {Measuring social tolerance: An experimental approach in two lemurid
   primates},
Journal = {ETHOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {124},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-73},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Social tolerance crucially affects the life of group-living animals as
   it can influence, among other things, their competitive regimes, access
   to food, learning behavior, and recruitment. However, social tolerance
   tests were mainly conducted in semi-free or captive populations, and we
   know little about the behavioral mechanisms and consequences of social
   tolerance under natural conditions. We therefore developed a co-feeding
   experiment to measure social tolerance in groups of wild and captive
   animals across two primate species. Specifically, we recorded the social
   tolerance level of redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons, four wild, one
   captive group) and ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta, three wild, three
   captive groups) by presenting a clumped food resource in an experimental
   arena, and recorded patterns of resource use during the experiment.
   Because redfronted lemurs exhibit lower levels of decided conflicts than
   ringtailed lemurs, we predicted that they would be socially more
   tolerant. The probability for an individual to feed in the arena was
   higher in redfronted lemurs than in ringtailed lemurs. In addition, in
   both species, the probability for an individual to feed in the arena was
   higher in the captive populations than in their wild counterparts,
   suggesting that proximate factors, such as a relaxation of feeding
   competition in captivity, may adapt species-specific levels of social
   tolerance to local levels of food availability. Hence, the number of
   individuals co-feeding on a valuable food resource appears to be a
   useful proxy of social tolerance that could be measured with this
   experimental setup in other wild and captive species as well.},

Abstract = {Sheth's dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus shethi, is a small, recently
   discovered nocturnal primate endemic to northern Madagascar. Unlike many
   other nocturnal lemurs, C. shethi lives sympatrically with
   morphologically similar species of its cryptic genus, making it
   difficult for biologists to determine its population density and
   distribution. Here, we present new data and observations of this
   species. During a series of rapid biodiversity assessments in the SAVA
   region of north-eastern Madagascar, we observed C. shethi in 10
   different sites, 9 of which were not previously known to harbour C.
   shethi populations. More significantly, 2 of these sites, in
   Analamanara, were situated approximately 20 km south of the previously
   known southern extremity of this species' distribution. This represents
   a large increase in the previously limited geographic range of this
   species. Moreover, our relatively high encounter rates at these sites
   suggest that C. shethi population densities may be high. We also
   observed C. shethi in human-altered (e.g., vanilla plantations) and
   non-forest, savannah environments, suggesting that this species can
   tolerate disturbed habitats. Our findings therefore provide important
   additional information on the distribution of C. shethi populations and
   highlight the necessity of further study for the conservation of this
   species.},

Abstract = {As with many other species in the primate order, ring-tailed lemurs

Volume = {9},

Pages = {202-217},
Abstract = {Many studies have demonstrated the effects of host diet on gut microbial
   membership, metagenomics, and fermentation individually; but few have
   attempted to interpret the relationship among these biological phenomena
   with respect to host features (e.g. gut morphology). We quantitatively
   compare the fecal microbial communities, metabolic pathways, and
   fermentation products associated with the nutritional intake of
   frugivorous (fruit-eating) and folivorous (leafeating) lemurs. Our
   results provide a uniquely multidimensional and comparative perspective
   on the adaptive dynamics between host and microbiome. Shotgun
   metagenomic sequencing revealed significant differential taxonomic and
   metabolic pathway enrichment, tailored to digest and detoxify different
   diets. Frugivorous metagenomes feature pathways to degrade simple
   carbohydrates and host-derived glycosaminogiycans, while folivorous
   metagenomes are equipped to break down phytic acid and other
   phytochemical compounds in an anaerobic environment. We used nuclear
   magnetic resonance based metabolic profiling of fecal samples to link
   metabolic pathways to fermentation products, confirming that the
   dissimilar substrates provided in each diet select for specific
   microbial functions. Fecal samples from frugivorous lemurs contained
   significantly different profiles of short chain fatty acids, alcohol
   fermentation products, amino acids, glucose, and glycerol compared to
   folivorous lemurs. We present the relationships between these datasets
   as an integrated visual framework, which we refer to as microbial
   geometry. We use microbial geometry to compare empirical gut microbial
   profiles across different feeding strategies, and suggest additional
   utility as a tool for hypothesis-generation.},

Title = {Sex-Typed Social Development in Lemur catta},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {89},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {224-239},
Abstract = {Strong chemical control of strepsirrhine mating behaviour when compared
   to haplorhines might suggest that strepsirrhine behavioural development,
   generally, is under stronger somatic control. A comparative lack of
   reported behavioural sex differences in immature strepsirrhines would
   seem to support this hypothesis, but the recent discovery of sex
   differences in juvenile foraging behaviour in Lemur catta suggests that
   this difference might be an artefact of undersampling in strepsirrhines.
   Here, I document in wild L. catta the temporal development of a wider
   repertoire of social behaviours than have been studied in captivity over
   a longer developmental duration than has been studied in the wild to
   identify which behaviours might be and which cannot be linked to
   puberty. Sex differences in proximity and agonism did not appear before
   2 years, consistent with previous reports and suggestions that they are
   linked to somatic or social changes at puberty. Immature females
   exhibited adult female-typical interest in infants; immature males
   demonstrated elements of adult male scent- marking behaviour, and
   immature males demonstrated marked attraction to adult males - sex
   differences that cannot be dependent on gonadal maturation. Immature L.
   catta exhibited some sex differences common in immature haplorhines,
   which are thought to be strategic choices by immatures to increase their
   later reproductive success. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Title = {Climatic, social and reproductive influences on behavioural
   thermoregulation in a female-dominated lemur},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {25-34},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {It is well established that social rank in a large group confers a
   higher adaptive value to a dominant individual relative to others,
   although there is scant evidence that members of small social groups
   either have similar social standing or maintain strict dominance. We
   aimed to determine whether members of small social groups, using the
   southern bamboo lemur, Hapalemur meridionalis, as a model, gain
   rank-related benefits. We first established a dominance hierarchy
   through a network-based analysis of win-loss interactions, which showed
   that adult females maintained social dominance within their groups,
   similar to many strepsirrhine species. To address whether dominant
   individuals gained rank-related benefits, we then explored how social
   dynamics may permit access to resting huddles, which provide a
   physiological benefit. Social thermoregulation, i.e. huddling, is a
   behavioural energy conservation mechanism, and among many mammals is a
   direct response to decreasing ambient temperatures. As such, huddling
   behaviour may have evolved among social animals because of its potential
   direct and indirect benefits. To examine the effect of dominance rank
   within small social groups on huddling inclusion, we used generalized
   linear mixed-effects models to predict the likelihood of huddling
   occurring during resting bouts from climatic (e.g. temperature,
   precipitation), social (e.g. affiliation, dominance rank, grooming) and
   reproductive (e.g. access, infant protection) variables. We found that
   lower temperatures, especially during shorter resting bouts, increased
   the likelihood of huddling. Grooming between partners with a high
   discrepancy in rank increased huddling. Additionally, huddling increased
   during the reproductive season, potentially offering greater opportunity
   for males to gain favour with sexually receptive females, and when
   new-borns were present, providing essential thermal maintenance and
   potential antipredator protection to infants. Together, our results
   suggest that even in small social groups, females gain rank-related
   benefits by controlling access to huddles, i.e. the intrinsic benefits
   of social thermoregulation. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {Systematic genetic studies of a handful of diverse organisms over the
   past 50 years have transformed our understanding of biology. However,
   many aspects of primate biology, behavior, and disease are absent or
   poorly modeled in any of the current genetic model organisms including
   mice. We surveyed the animal kingdom to find other animals with
   advantages similar to mice that might better exemplify primate biology,
   and identified mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) as the outstanding
   candidate. Mouse lemurs are prosimian primates, roughly half the genetic
   distance between mice and humans. They are the smallest, fastest
   developing, and among the most prolific and abundant primates in the
   world, distributed throughout the island of Madagascar, many in separate
   breeding populations due to habitat destruction. Their physiology,
   behavior, and phylogeny have been studied for decades in laboratory
   colonies in Europe and in field studies in Malagasy rainforests, and a
   high quality reference genome sequence has recently been completed. To
   initiate a classical genetic approach, we developed a deep phenotyping
   protocol and have screened hundreds of laboratory and wild mouse lemurs
   for interesting phenotypes and begun mapping the underlying mutations,
   in collaboration with leading mouse lemur biologists. We also seek to
   establish a mouse lemur gene ``knockout{''} library by sequencing the
   genomes of thousands of mouse lemurs to identify null alleles in most
   genes from the large pool of natural genetic variants. As part of this
   effort, we have begun a citizen science project in which students across
   Madagascar explore the remarkable biology around their schools,
   including longitudinal studies of the local mouse lemurs. We hope this
   work spawns a new model organism and cultivates a deep genetic
   understanding of primate biology and health. We also hope it establishes
   a new and ethical method of genetics that bridges biological,
   behavioral, medical, and conservation disciplines, while providing an
   example of how hands-on science education can help transform developing
   countries.},

Abstract = {Lemurs, lorises, and tarsiers are socially and ecologically diverse
   primates that include some of the most endangered mammals. We review
   results of long-term studies of 15 lemur species from 7 sites in
   Madagascar and 1 species each of loris and tarsier in Indonesia. We
   emphasize that the existence of long-term study populations is a crucial
   prerequisite for planning and conducting shorter studies on specific
   topics, as exemplified by various ecophysiological studies of lemurs.
   Extended studies of known individuals have revealed variation in social
   organization within and between ecologically similar species. Even for
   these primates with relatively fast life histories, it required more
   than a decade of paternity data to characterize male reproductive skew.
   The long-term consequences of female rank on reproductive success remain
   poorly known, however. Long-term monitoring of known individuals is the
   only method to obtain data on life-history adaptations, which appear to
   be shaped by predation in the species covered here; long-term studies
   are also needed for addressing particular questions in community
   ecology. The mere presence of long-term projects has a positive effect
   on the protection of study sites, and they generate unique data that are
   fundamental to conservation measures, such as close monitoring of
   populations.},

Title = {Range Extension and Behavioural Observations of the Recently Described
   Sheth's Dwarf Lemur (Cheirogaleus shethi)},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {88},

Abstract = {Sheth's dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus shethi, is a small, recently
   discovered nocturnal primate endemic to northern Madagascar. Unlike many
   other nocturnal lemurs, C. shethi lives sympatrically with
   morphologically similar species of its cryptic genus, making it
   difficult for biologists to determine its population density and
   distribution. Here, we present new data and observations of this
   species. During a series of rapid biodiversity assessments in the SAVA
   region of north-eastern Madagascar, we observed C. shethi in 10
   different sites, 9 of which were not previously known to harbour C.
   shethi populations. More significantly, 2 of these sites, in
   Analamanara, were situated approximately 20 km south of the previously
   known southern extremity of this species' distribution. This represents
   a large increase in the previously limited geographic range of this
   species. Moreover, our relatively high encounter rates at these sites
   suggest that C. shethi population densities may be high. We also
   observed C. shethi in human-altered (e.g., vanilla plantations) and
   non-forest, savannah environments, suggesting that this species can
   tolerate disturbed habitats. Our findings therefore provide important
   additional information on the distribution of C. shethi populations and
   highlight the necessity of further study for the conservation of this
   species. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Title = {Does habitat disturbance affect stress, body condition and parasitism in
   two sympatric lemurs?},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Understanding how animals react to human-induced changes in their
   environment is a key question in conservation biology. Owing to their
   potential correlation with fitness, several physiological parameters are
   commonly used to assess the effect of habitat disturbance on animals'
   general health status. Here, we studied how two lemur species, the
   fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius) and the grey mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus), respond to changing environmental conditions by
   comparing their stress levels (measured as hair cortisol concentration),
   parasitism and general body condition across four habitats ordered along
   a gradient of human disturbance at Kirindy Forest, Western Madagascar.
   These two species previously revealed contrasting responses to human
   disturbance; whereas M. murinus is known as a resilient species, C.
   medius is rarely encountered in highly disturbed habitats. However,
   neither hair cortisol concentrations nor parasitism patterns
   (prevalence, parasite species richness and rate of multiple infections)
   and body condition varied across the gradient of anthropogenic
   disturbance. Our results indicate that the effect of anthropogenic
   activities at Kirindy Forest is not reflected in the general health
   status of both species, which may have developed a range of behavioural
   adaptations to deal with suboptimal conditions. Nonetheless, a
   difference in relative density among sites suggests that the carrying
   capacity of disturbed habitat is lower, and both species respond
   differently to environmental changes, with C. medius being more
   negatively affected. Thus, even for behaviourally flexible species,
   extended habitat deterioration could hamper long-term viability of
   populations.},

Abstract = {Madagascar's lemurs display a diverse array of feeding strategies with
   complex relationships to seed dispersal mechanisms in Malagasy plants.
   Although these relationships have been explored previously on a
   case-by-case basis, we present here the first comprehensive analysis of
   lemuriform feeding, to our knowledge, and its hypothesized effects on
   seed dispersal and the long-term survival of Malagasy plant lineages. We
   used a molecular phylogenetic framework to examine the mode and tempo of
   diet evolution, and to quantify the associated morphological space
   occupied by Madagascar's lemurs, both extinct and extant. Using
   statistical models and morphometric analyses, we demonstrate that the
   extinction of large-bodied lemurs resulted in a significant reduction in
   functional morphological space associated with seed dispersal ability.
   These reductions carry potentially far-reaching consequences for
   Malagasy ecosystems, and we highlight large-seeded Malagasy plants that
   appear to be without extant animal dispersers. We also identify living
   lemurs that are endangered yet occupy unique and essential dispersal
   niches defined by our morphometric analyses.},

Title = {Fatal echinococcosis in three lemurs in the United Kingdom-A case series},
Journal = {VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {218},
Pages = {10-14},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus reside in the small intestine of a
   number of carnivorous species, predominantly canids. In enzootic areas,
   hydatidosis caused by taeniid metacestodes can present a significant
   problem in accidental intermediate hosts, including humans. Whereas the
   United Kingdom is currently considered free of Echinococcus
   multilocularis, Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.) and
   Echinococcus equinus are endemic in the UK and have been reported in a
   variety of captive mammals. The presentation of echinoccocosis in
   non-human primates widely parallels disease in humans, and public health
   concerns are related to the four genera, E. granulosus, E.
   multilocularis, Echinococcus vogeli and Echinococcus oligarthrus. In
   contrast, sporadic outbreaks and individual hydatid disease cases in
   non-human primates have been associated with several Echinococcus and
   Taenia species. Here we describe three fatal cases of cystic
   echinococcosis in two captive ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur cotta) and one
   captive red-ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata rubra) and provide molecular
   tapeworm characterisation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this
   includes the first report of Echinococcus ortleppi in a UK born
   ring-tailed lemur and provides the first in depth case reports of
   echinococcosis due to E. equinus in UK born ring-tailed and red ruffed
   lemurs with detailed clinical and pathological findings. The cestode
   life cycle and implications for zoo collections are discussed. (C) 2015

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective To determine the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of
   sevoflurane for ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) and aye-ayes
   (Daubentonia madagascariensis).
   Study design Prospective experimental trial.
   Animals Six adult ring-tailed lemurs, aged 1.3-11.2 years (median age:
   8.26) and weighing a mean +/- standard deviation (SD) of 2283 +/- 254 g.
   Five adult aye-ayes, aged 4.4-19.3 years (median age: 8.0) and weighing
   2712 +/- 191 g.
   Methods Minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane was determined
   using a tail-clamp stimulus. The end-tidal sevoflurane (FE'Sevo)
   concentration was increased or decreased by approximately 10\% after a
   positive or negative response to tail clamping, respectively. This
   procedure was repeated until a positive and negative result were seen on
   two consecutive trials (i.e. a negative result was achieved and a single
   10\% decrease in FE'Sevo concentration resulted in a positive test). The
   MAC for that animal was determined to be the mean of the concentrations
   at the two consecutive trials.
   Results The mean +/- SD MAC of sevoflurane for ring-tailed lemurs was
   3.48 +/- 0.55\% and 1.84 +/- 0.17 for aye-ayes. This represents a 47.1\%
   higher MAC in ring-tailed lemurs compared to aye-ayes.
   Conclusions and clinical relevance The sevoflurane MAC was significantly
   higher in ring-tailed lemurs, compared to aye-ayes. The MAC of
   sevoflurane in aye-ayes is consistent with reported MAC values in other
   species. Extrapolation of sevoflurane anesthetic dose between different
   species of lemurs could lead to significant errors in anesthetic dosing.},

Title = {Lemurs groom-at-a-distance through vocal networks},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {110},
Pages = {179-186},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Vocal exchanges are predicted to serve a social bonding function by
   allowing conspecifics to `groom-at-a-distance'. If vocalizations play a
   role in bonding, then they should be mainly exchanged between the
   socially bonded group members, and thus display high social selectivity
   that characterizes other affiliative behaviours such as grooming.
   However, whether or not vocal exchanges are driven by social bonds
   remains unclear. We investigated vocal selectivity by studying the
   relationships between contact-calling networks and grooming networks in
   multiple free-ranging groups of ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta. Lemur
   grooming interactions were socially selective and were directed towards
   only some of their group members. However, their vocal exchanges
   displayed even higher levels of social selectivity. Instead of
   exchanging vocalizations with each group member they groomed, lemurs
   reserved their vocal responses mainly for the group members whom they
   had frequently groomed. We tested this vocal selectivity through a
   playback experiment in which we presented lemurs' calls to their group.
   Lemurs responded only to the playbacks of the conspecifics whose calls
   they had responded to while free-ranging, confirming that selective
   vocal responses do not depend on proximal (i.e. visual or olfactory)
   cues from the vocalizing lemur. These robust relationships between
   grooming and contact-calling networks in lemurs, a species that lives in
   small groups where grooming frequency reflects bond strength,
   demonstrates that vocal exchanges indicate the strong social bonds
   between conspecifics. Contact calls may serve a bonding function in
   social species by allowing the strongly bonded group members to
   groom-at-a-distance when they are separated from each other. (C) 2015

   Madagascar: Anja Reserve and Tsaranoro Valley forest. Leaves and fruit
   of Melia azedarach were a keystone resource for Anja lemurs in wet and
   dry seasons. At Tsaranoro, L. catta relied on M. azedarach and Ficus
   spp. in dry season, but during the wet season, neither was a dominant
   food resource. Top food species at both sites differed markedly from
   those consumed by L. catta in other habitats. At Tsaranoro, a greater
   proportion of lemurs engaged in feeding during the dry season compared
   with wet season. We attribute this to resource scarcity during dry
   season, when greater feeding effort is needed to maintain energy
   requirements. Because M. azedarach is ubiquitous throughout Anja
   Reserve, producing fruit and leaves year-round, Anja lemurs can meet
   energy requirements with little seasonal adjustment in feeding activity.
   L. catta's IUCN status has been upgraded to Endangered, thus, greater
   insight into its diet flexibility and ability to survive on introduced
   plant species, can inform conservation plans in remaining wild habitats
   and ex situ programs.},

Title = {Comparison of the genetic variation of captive ring-tailed lemurs with a
   wild population in Madagascar},
Journal = {ZOO BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Pages = {463-472},

Abstract = {Genetic variability among captive and wild ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur
   catta) was assessed using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data. A 529bp
   segment of mtDNA was sequenced and 9 microsatellite loci were genotyped
   for 286 ring-tailed lemurs. Samples were obtained from the well-studied
   L. catta population at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve and from
   captive animals at six institutions worldwide. We found evidence of
   possible patrilineal contribution but the absence of matrilineal
   contribution from the Beza area, and haplotypes not found in Beza but
   present in Ambohimahavelona, Andringitra Massif, and other unknown
   locations, in the sampled captive population, indicating that the
   founders of the captive population originated from a wide geographic
   range. Total genetic variation and relatedness in captive L. catta in
   the six institutions were similar in extent to that of the wild
   population in Beza. Based on the diverse origins of the captive
   population founders our results suggest the erosion of genetic diversity
   in the captive population. Sampled individuals from the same institution
   were more closely related to each other than members of a social group
   in the wild. Individuals housed at different institutions were less
   closely related than those of different social groups at Beza,
   indicating lower genetic exchange between captive institutions than
   between social groups in a locality in the wild. Our findings underscore
   the usefulness of genotyping in determining the geographic origin of
   captive population founders, obtaining pedigree information if paternity
   is uncertain, and in maximizing preservation of extant genetic diversity
   in captivity. Zoo Biol. 34:463-472, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {56},
Number = {3},
Pages = {241-252},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We tested five lemur species-ring-tailed lemurs, ruffed lemurs, mongoose
   lemurs, black lemurs, and Coquerel's sifakas-(N = 52) in an experiment
   that evaluated skills for inhibitory control in a social context. First,
   two human experimenters presented identical food rewards; the
   ``generous{''} experimenter allowed the subject to eat from her hand,
   whereas the ``competitive{''} experimenter always withheld the reward.
   Lemurs quickly learned to approach the generous experimenter and avoid
   the competitive one. In the inhibition test phase, we endowed the
   competitive experimenter with a more valuable food reward but the
   competitive experimenter continued to withhold food from the subject.
   Thus, lemurs were required to inhibit approaching the more desirable
   reward in favor of the lesser but obtainable reward presented by the
   generous experimenter. In test trials, lemurs' tendency to approach the
   competitive experimenter increased from the reputation phase,
   demonstrating sensitivity to the experimental manipulation. However,
   subjects approached the larger reward less frequently in test trials
   compared with pretest food-preference trials, evidencing some capacity
   for inhibitory control in this context. Despite differences in sociality
   and ecology, the five lemur species did not differ in this ability.
   Although the study did not uncover species differences, this
   experimental task may provide a useful measure of social inhibition in
   broader comparative studies.},

Title = {Telomere regulation during ageing and tumorigenesis of the grey mouse
   lemur},
Journal = {BIOCHIMIE},

Volume = {113},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Telomere erosion leading to replicative senescence has been well
   documented in human and anthropoid primates, and provides a clue against
   tumorigenesis. In contrast, other mammals, such as laboratory mice, with
   short lifespan and low body weight mass have different telomere biology
   without replicative senescence. We analyzed telomere biology in the grey
   mouse lemur, a small prosimian model with a relative long lifespan
   currently used in ageing research. We report an average telomere length
   by telomere restriction fragment (TRF) among the longest reported so far
   for a primate species (25-30 kb), but without detectable overall
   telomere shortening with ageing on blood samples. However, we
   demonstrate using universal STELA (Single Telomere Length Amplification)
   the existence of short telomeres, the increase of which, while
   correlating with ageing might be related to another mechanism than
   replicative senescence. We also found a low stringency of telomerase
   restriction in tissues and an ease to immortalize fibroblasts in vitro
   upon spontaneous telomerase activation. Finally, we describe the first
   grey mouse lemur cancer cell line showing a dramatic telomere shortening
   and high telomerase activity associated with polyploidy. Our overall
   results suggest that telomere biology in grey mouse lemur is an
   exception among primates, with at best a physiologically limited
   replicative telomere ageing and closest to that observed in small
   rodents. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {229-238},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The vomeronasal organ (VNO), also known as the Jacobson's organ, is a
   bilateral chemosensory organ found at the base of the nasal cavity
   specialized for the detection of higher-molecular weight (non-volatile)
   chemostimuli. It has been linked to pheromone detection. The VNO has
   been well studied in nocturnal lemurs and lorises, but poorly studied in
   diurnal/cathemeral species despite the large repertoire of olfactory
   behaviors noted in species such as Lemur catta. Here, the VNO and
   associated structures were studied microanatomically in one adult female
   and one adult male L. catta. Traditional and immunohistochemical
   procedures demonstrate the VNO epithelium consists of multiple rows of
   sensory neurons. Immunoreactivity to Growth-associated protein 43
   (GAP43) indicates the VNO is postnatally neurogenic. In volume, the VNO
   neuroepithelium scales similarly to palatal length compared to nocturnal
   strepsirrhines. Numerous taste buds present at the oral opening to the
   nasopalatine duct, with which the VNO communicates, provide an
   additional (or alternative) explanation for the flehmen behavior that
   has been observed in this species. The VNO of L. catta is shown to be
   microanatomically comparable to that of nocturnal strepsirrhines. Like
   nocturnal strepsirrhines, the VNO of L. catta may be functional in the
   reception of high-molecular weight secretions. Am. J. Primatol.

Title = {The socio-matrix reloaded: from hierarchy to dominance profile in wild
   lemurs},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Dominance hierarchy influences the life quality of social animals, and
   its definition should in principle be based on the outcome of agonistic
   interactions. However, defining and comparing the dominance profile of
   social groups is difficult due to the different dominance measures used
   and because no one measure explains it all. We applied different
   analytical methods to winner-loser sociomatrices to determine the
   dominance profile of five groups of wild lemurs (species: Lemur catta,
   Propithecus verreauxi, and Eulemur rufus x collaris) from the Berenty
   forest (Madagascar). They are an excellent study model because they
   share the same habitat and an apparently similar dominance profile:
   linear hierarchy and female dominance. Data were collected over more
   than 1200 h of observation. Our approach included four steps: (1) by
   applying the binary dyadic dominance relationship method (I\&SI) on
   either aggressions or supplant sociomatrices we verified whether
   hierarchy was aggression or submission based; (2) by calculating
   normalized David's scores and measuring steepness from aggression
   sociomatrices we evaluated whether hierarchy was shallow or steep; (3)
   by comparing the ranking orders obtained with methods 1 and 2 we
   assessed whether hierarchy was consistent or not; and (4) by assessing
   triangle transitivity and comparing it with the linearity index and the
   level of group cohesion we determined if hierarchy was more or less
   cohesive. Our results show that L. catta groups have got a steep,
   consistent, highly transitive and cohesive hierarchy. P. verreauxi
   groups are characterized by a moderately steep and consistent hierarchy,
   with variable levels of triangle transitivity and cohesion. E. rufus x
   collaris group possesses a shallow and inconsistent hierarchy, with
   lower (but not lowest) levels of transitivity and cohesion. A multiple
   analytical approach on winner-loser sociomatrices other than leading to
   an in-depth description of the dominance profile, allows intergroup and
   cross-species comparisons.},

Abstract = {Polyspecific associations are well documented, but have rarely been

   affiliative association between a female ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta)
   and a group of southern bamboo lemurs (Hapalemur meridionalis) in
   south-east Madagascar. Our main research focused on H. meridionalis;
   however, due to the presence of the L. catta we treated her as a group
   member, including her in the focal sampling of Hapalemur social
   behaviour. We also recorded ad libitum data on all food species/items
   and any unique events or occurrences. Among observations, both species
   appeared to have a mutual understanding of vocalisations, behavioural
   synchronisation, dietary overlap, and possible service exchange, e.g.,
   grooming. We also observed the L. catta occasionally attending to the
   bamboo lemur infant. This included grooming, baby-sitting, and even
   transporting the infant. The behavioural flexibility exhibited by both
   species has allowed the successful integration of the female ring-tailed
   lemur.},

Title = {Reproductive Female Feeding Strategies in Spiny Forest-Dwelling Lemur
   catta in Southern and Southwestern Madagascar: How Do Females Meet the

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {86},

Pages = {16-24},
Abstract = {The spiny forest ecoregion of southern and southwestern Madagascar is
   characterized by low annual rainfall, high temperatures, short-stature
   xeric vegetation and lack of canopy. Lemur catta is often the only
   diurnal primate persisting in this habitat. For reproductive females
   living in spiny forests, gestation and early-to-mid lactation periods
   occur during the dry season when food resources are limited. We
   conducted a between-site comparison of variables important to the
   feeding ecology of reproductive female L. catta inhabiting spiny forest
   at 3 sites: Berenty spiny forest (BSF), Cap Sainte-Marie (CSM) and
   Tsimanampesotse National Park (TNP). We hypothesize that the ability for
   pregnant and lactating females to adequately obtain plant foods high in
   protein, low in fiber and with a high water content is crucial to their
   survival and successful reproduction in spiny habitat. We found
   favorable or relatively equal protein-to-fiber ratios in plant foods
   most frequently consumed by reproductive females, and preferred foods
   contained high water content. Some overlap in preferred plant species at
   the 3 sites suggests important plant foods for reproductive females
   inhabiting spiny forests. We suggest that choosing foods high in
   protein, relatively low in fiber and with high water content are
   behavioral adaptations allowing female L. catta to reproduce and survive
   in this habitat. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Title = {Cognition in Ring-Tailed Lemurs},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {86},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {106-116},
Abstract = {In order to better understand the evolution of cognitive abilities in
   primates, information on cognitive traits of the most basal living
   primates can provide important comparative baseline data. Compared to
   haplorhine primates, lemurs have relatively smaller brains and reduced
   abilities to solve problems in the technical and social domain. However,
   recent studies have suggested that some cognitive abilities of lemurs
   are qualitatively equal to those of haplorhines. Here, we review studies
   investigating cognitive abilities in the technical and social domain of
   ring-tailed lemur cognition. In the physical domain, ring-tailed lemurs
   exhibit similar qualitative cognitive skills as other lemurs but also
   haplorhine primates. In the social domain, ring-tailed lemurs appear to
   be more skilled in visual perspective taking than other lemurs. Compared
   to other lemurs, they also have highly elaborated communicative skills.
   Moreover, within-group coalitions have been observed in female
   ring-tailed lemurs during rare events of female evictions but not in
   other lemur species. However, in several other aspects of social
   cognition, such as reconciliation and social learning, ring-tailed
   lemurs' cognitive abilities are equal to those of other lemurs. Thus,
   additional systematic comparative studies in physical and social
   cognition are required for a more comprehensive understanding of the
   processes of cognitive evolution among primates. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG,

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {86},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {44-55},
Abstract = {Coat and body mass status provide a potential noninvasive way to assess
   primate health status as well as the effects of seasonality, resource
   use and reproductive state. Coat and body condition were scored visually
   for 36 wild Lemur catta at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve,
   Madagascar, from July 2012 to March 2013. Coat quality generally
   increased during the wet season when resource availability increased, in
   contrast to that observed during the resource-depleted dry season.
   Alopecia frequency increased from June to December and declined between
   January and March. Sex differences for coat condition were only observed
   in January, when males had superior coat scores. Body condition did not
   vary by month or sex except in February, when males were larger than
   females. Females that birthed infants were of lower body size than
   individuals who did not for November and from January to March. Our
   results indicate visual methods effectively detect variability in coat
   and body condition related to seasonality and reproductive status. Such
   methods present a noninvasive means for assessing the impact of seasonal
   resource availability, stresses of infant care and reproductive state on
   ring-tailed lemurs, and may be useful for assessing the impacts of these
   factors on general health status. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {Ring-tailed lemurs have been studied intensively in the Parcel 1 gallery
   forest of Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve. Here, we report on lemur groups
   in a mixture of deciduous dry forest and spiny forest just 5 km to the
   west. Compared to Parcel 1, Parcel 2 (P2) has a lower density of
   Tamarindus indica, a major dietary plant species for gallery forest
   lemurs. Recent studies in drier habitats have called into question the
   association of lemur density and tamarind presence. In order to address
   this question, we measured forest structure and composition of plant
   plots between parcels and conducted lemur feeding observations. The
   trees and shrubs within the parcels did not differ in height or diameter
   at breast height, but the frequencies of plant species that were common
   between parcels were significantly different. Numbers of feeding
   observations on foods common to both parcels did not differ, but their
   relative rankings within parcels did. Frequencies of food plants
   corresponded to earlier reports of lemur population densities. However,
   we found that the ring-tailed lemur diet is a mixture of plants that are
   eaten in abundance regardless of frequency and those that are locally
   available. In terms of their reliance on Tamarindus, P2 animals appear
   intermediate between those in gallery forests and nontamarind sites. (C)

   Implications for the locomotor behavior of the subfossil lemurs

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {Lumbar vertebral morphology has been used as an indicator of locomotor
   behavior in living and fossil mammals. Rigidity within the lumbar region
   is thought to be important for increasing overall axial rigidity during
   various forms of locomotion, including bridging between supports,
   inverted quadrupedalism, gliding, and flying. However, distinguishing
   between those behaviors using bony features has been challenging. This
   study used osteological characters of the lumbar vertebrae to attempt to
   develop fine-grade functional distinctions among different mammalian
   species in order to make more complete inferences about how the axial
   skeleton affects locomotor behavior in extant mammals. These same lumbar
   characters were measured in two extinct species for which locomotor
   behaviors are well known, the sloth lemurs (Palaeopropithecus and
   Babakotia radofilai), in order to further evaluate their locomotor
   behaviors.

   determined to be functionally significant from previous studies,
   demonstrate that inverted quadrupeds in the sample are characterized by
   dorsoventrally short and cranio-caudally expanded spinous processes,
   dorsally oriented transverse processes, and mediolaterally short and
   dorsoventrally high vertebral bodies compared with mammals that are
   relatively pronograde, vertical clingers, or gliders. Antipronograde
   mammals, dermopterans, and chiropterans also exhibit these traits, but
   not to the same extent as the inverted quadrupeds. In accordance with
   previous studies, our data show that the sloth lemur B. radofilai groups
   closely with anti-pronograde mammals like lorises, while
   Palaeopropithecus groups with extant sloths. These findings suggest that
   Palaeopropithecus was engaged in inverted quadrupedalism at a high
   frequency, while B. radofilai may have engaged in a more diverse array
   of locomotor and positional behaviors. The osteological features used
   here reflect differences in lumbar mobility and suggest that axial
   rigidity is advantageous for suspensory locomotion and possibly flight
   in bats. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Individual recognition through olfactory - auditory matching in lemurs},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},

Abstract = {Individual recognition can be facilitated by creating representations of
   familiar individuals, whereby information from signals in multiple
   sensory modalities become linked. Many vertebrate species use
   auditory-visual matching to recognize familiar conspecifics and
   heterospecifics, but we currently do not know whether representations of
   familiar individuals incorporate information from other modalities.
   Ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) are highly visual, but also communicate
   via scents and vocalizations. To investigate the role of olfactory
   signals in multisensory recognition, we tested whether lemurs can
   recognize familiar individuals through matching scents and
   vocalizations. We presented lemurs with female scents that were paired
   with the contact call either of the female whose scent was presented or
   of another familiar female from the same social group. When the scent
   and the vocalization came from the same individual versus from different
   individuals, females showed greater interest in the scents, and males
   showed greater interest in both the scents and the vocalizations,
   suggesting that lemurs can recognize familiar females via
   olfactory-auditory matching. Because identity signals in lemur scents
   and vocalizations are produced by different effectors and often
   encountered at different times (uncoupled in space and time), this
   matching suggests lemurs form multisensory representations through a
   newly recognized sensory integration underlying individual recognition.},

Abstract = {Adaptive radiations provide important insights into many aspects of
   evolution, including the relationship between ecology and morphological
   diversification as well as between ecology and speciation. Many such
   radiations include divergence along a dietary axis, although other
   ecological variables may also drive diversification, including
   differences in diel activity patterns. This study examines the role of
   two key ecological variables, diet and activity patterns, in shaping the
   radiation of a diverse clade of primates, the Malagasy lemurs. When
   phylogeny was ignored, activity pattern and several dietary variables
   predicted a significant proportion of cranial shape variation. However,
   when phylogeny was taken into account, only typical diet accounted for a
   significant proportion of shape variation. One possible explanation for
   this discrepancy is that this radiation was characterized by a
   relatively small number of dietary shifts (and possibly changes in body
   size) that occurred in conjunction with the divergence of major clades.
   This pattern may be difficult to detect with the phylogenetic
   comparative methods used here, but may characterize not just lemurs but
   other mammals.},

Journal = {PRIMATES},

Abstract = {Cathemerality consists of discrete periods of activity during both the
   day and night. Though uncommon within Primates, cathemerality is
   prevalent in some lemur genera, such as Eulemur, Hapalemur, and
   Prolemur. Several researchers have also reported nighttime activity in
   Lemur catta, yet these lemurs are generally considered ``strictly
   diurnal{''}. We used behavioral observations and camera traps to examine
   cathemerality of L. catta at the Tsimanampetsotsa National Park,
   Madagascar. Nighttime activity occurred throughout the study period
   (September 2010-April 2011), and correlated with warm overnight
   temperatures but not daytime temperatures. Animals spent 25 \% of their
   daytime active behaviors on the ground, but appeared to avoid the ground
   at night, with only 5 \% of their time on the ground. Furthermore, at
   night, animals spent the majority of their active time feeding (53 \%
   nighttime, 43 \% daytime). These findings imply that both
   thermoregulation and diet play a role in the adaptive significance of
   cathemerality. Additionally, predator avoidance may have influenced
   cathemerality here, in that L. catta may limit nighttime activity as a
   result of predation threat by forest cats (Felis sp.) or fossa
   (Cryptoprocta ferox). Further data are needed on cathemeral lemurs
   generally, but particularly in L. catta if we are to fully understand
   the evolutionary mechanisms of cathemerality in the Lemuridae.},

Title = {Seasonal patterns of male affiliation in ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur

Journal = {BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {151},
Number = {7, SI},

Abstract = {We examined the mechanisms guiding male affiliative relationships among
   ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) to investigate the adaptive
   significance of male social bonds in a female dominant, strictly
   seasonally breeding strepsirhine primate. To test whether male
   affiliative relationships were driven by reproductive and/or ecological
   conditions, we compared the frequency of male affiliation across the
   annual reproductive cycle in populations of L. catta inhabiting three
   habitat types found within its geographic range: (1) gallery forest at
   Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve in southwestern Madagascar; (2) spiny bush
   at Cap Sainte-Marie (CSM) in southern Madagascar; and (3) rocky-outcrop
   forest fragments at Anja Reserve and the Tsaranoro Valley in
   Madagascar's south-central highlands. Each study period spanned the
   gestation, lactation/migration, post-migration, and mating periods.
   Inter-male affiliation rates varied across reproductive periods at each
   of the four sites, with the highest frequencies being observed during
   the gestation and lactation/migration periods and the lowest frequencies
   occurring during the mating period. In contrast, we found no clear
   patterns in male female affiliation rates with respect to reproductive
   period. Comparing the Beza Mahafaly and CSM populations, rates of
   inter-male affiliation were higher at CSM during the gestation and
   lactation/migration periods, and rates male female affiliation were
   higher at CSM across all seasons except the post-migration period. We
   suggest that inter-male affiliative relationships in L. catta may
   provide beneficial social interactions (i.e., grooming, ectoparasite
   control, predator protection, vigilance against extra-group male
   agonism) when females are unavailable, particularly during male
   dispersal, as well as under harsh climatic conditions characteristic of
   some L. catta habitats.},

Abstract = {The rapid rate of habitat loss in Madagascar urges a comprehensive
   assessment of the threats that its fauna faces by living in fragmented,
   secondary and/or exotic forests. The role of habitat disturbance in
   determining potential boosts of parasite infections in lemurs, for
   instance, has been only recently investigated. Here, we conducted a
   preliminary assessment of prevalence and intensity of gastrointestinal
   parasite infections in two populations of endangered red-collared brown
   lemurs, Eulemur collaris (Geoffroy, 1812) (Mammalia: Lemuridae), living
   in two littoral forest fragments of southeastern Madagascar. We
   collected faecal samples from 45 lemurs. The samples were stored in 70\%
   alcohol, and we used a modified McMaster technique to analyze egg
   shedding. The analysis revealed only nematode infections. We found a
   higher prevalence of infection in the more disturbed fragment, while no
   differences were revealed in terms of infection intensity. Prevalence of
   infection was found to be sex-biased in the less degraded area, being
   higher in females. We hypothesize that this might have been caused by
   female immune suppression due to increased energetic costs during
   pregnancy and/or to avoid possible harm to the foetus. Since
   red-collared brown lemurs are the largest seed dispersers in the
   littoral forest and only small populations survive in a few fragments,
   the implications of our results should be considered in future
   conservation plans for this habitat.},

Abstract = {Frugivorous primates can play a critical role in the regeneration of
   degraded habitats by dispersing seeds of their food plants. We studied
   the diet and seed dispersal patterns of 3 groups of habituated
   red-ruffed lemurs (Varecia rubra) in a rain forest restoration site in
   Masoala National Park, Madagascar, to assess the species' seed dispersal
   effectiveness. Fruits accounted for 61\% of the diet, with an average
   foraging time of 10 min per fruit patch per day. Seeds from 75\% of the
   consumed fruit species were recovered in the collected V. rubra feces.
   We traced the potential parent plants of 20 dispersed-seed species to
   calculate a gut passage range (63-423 min; mean = 225, n = 35). The
   median seed dispersal distance from the potential parent plant was 48 m
   (mean = 83 m, range 0-568 m, n = 194). The home ranges of 2 of the 3
   groups overlapped with the regenerating forest parcels. Although 92\% of
   fecal samples with seeds were dispersed into the undisturbed forest, V.
   rubra fed on the fruits of the non-native pioneer shrub Clidemia hirta,
   while also dispersing native and non-native seed species into the
   regenerating forest parcels. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {Data are divergent about the ability of dietary omega 3 fatty acids to
   prevent age-associated cognitive decline. Most of the clinical trials
   failed to demonstrate a protective effect of.3 fatty acids against
   cognitive decline and methodological issues are still under debate.
   Conversely to human studies, experiments performed in adult rodents
   clearly indicate that long chain omega 3 fatty acids play a beneficial
   role in behavioral and cognitive functions. Inconsistent observations
   between human and rodent studies highlight the importance of the use of
   non-human primate models. We recently started a series of experiments on
   Grey mouse lemurs, an emerging non-human primate model of aging in order
   to assess the impact of omega 3 fatty acids dietary supplementation on
   several brain functions. These experiments started with the
   determination of the fatty acids composition of target organs (brain,
   adipose tissue, liver, plasma) of animals fed under control diet. We
   then explored the impact of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)
   supplementation on cognition and behavior in young and aged grey mouse
   lemurs. The aim of the present review is to compare the observations
   made in young and aged grey mouse lemurs and to explore the
   possibilities of new experiments in order to bridge the gap between
   rodents and Humans.},

Abstract = {Introduction. Madagascar is one of the highest biodiversity hotspots on
   the planet; however, it is also one of the most heavily impacted
   countries in the world in terms of forest degradation and general
   habitat destruction.
   Literature. Genus Lepilemur, in family Lepilemuridae, is a genus of
   small, nocturnal, exclusively arboreal Malagasy folivores. All species
   in the genus have small ranges of distribution. Fully forest-dependent,
   they have a high risk of extinction. Various models and theories of
   speciation mechanisms have been developed for the fauna and flora of
   Madagascar. For instance, in the northwestern part of the island, some
   authors used Lepilemur spp. to test two existing models of distribution:
   the ``Martin model{''} and ``Wilme model{''}.
   Conclusion. Regarding the impact of forest destruction and habitat
   degradation in Madagascar, conservation strategies for Lepilemur need to
   be put in place. This paper gives an overview of the current knowledge
   of the genus Lepilemur and examines speciation for Malagasy lemurs. The
   understanding of species distribution within biodiversity hotspots is
   important to identify target for conservation. Therefore, we summarize
   and compare three biogeography models related to lemurs distribution in
   order to understand the reasons behind the high diversity (26 species in
   total) among the genus Lepilemur. Particular attention is also given to
   the concept of species regarding biodiversity issues and the taxonomic
   explosion in genus Lepilemur.},

Title = {Squealing Rate Indicates Dominance Rank in the Male Ring-Tailed Lemur

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},

Volume = {75},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Squeals are sharp and forceful short-range vocalizations used as
   aggressive and submissive agonistic signals by many mammalian species.
   The ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), a female-dominant strepsirhine
   primate, has a male-specific squeal call with proposed male-male
   agonistic functions and male-female courtship functions that have never
   been empirically tested. The goal of my study is to clarify why
   ring-tailed lemur males squeal at other males and females by applying
   the handicap hypothesis to this male-specific vocalization. This
   hypothesis has rarely been tested in primates, and this study elucidates
   how the rate of a male-specific call relates to male-male and
   male-female behavior in a Malagasy strepsirhine. To test whether males
   squeal towards other males to assert dominance, I predict that male
   squealing rate is positively correlated with dominance rank. I further
   predict that male ring-tailed lemurs squeal at other males while engaged
   in agonistic interactions, and that squealing during an interaction is
   positively correlated with winning that encounter. To test whether males
   squeal towards females as a mate attraction signal, I predict that male
   squealing rate is higher on estrus days, and that estrous females
   indicate attraction by approaching squealing males. From March to July
   2010, 480hr of focal data were collected on 25 males aged three and
   older at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar. I continuously
   observed each male for 30min at a time and recorded all agonistic
   interactions and squeal vocalizations using 1-0 sampling at 2.5-min
   intervals. Squealing rate was higher during times of male-male agonism
   when compared to times without male-male agonism, and males with higher
   dominance ranks had higher squealing rates. In contrast, the mate
   attraction hypothesis was not supported. My results suggest that the
   male squeal is an agonistic signal when used in male-male interaction in
   ring-tailed lemurs, but does not specifically indicate aggression or
   submission. Am. J. Primatol. 75:1174-1184, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley

Title = {Imperilled phylogenetic endemism of Malagasy lemuriformes},

Abstract = {Aim To highlight where in Madagascar the phylogenetically and spatially
   rare lemur species at risk of extinction are concentrated. Location
   Madagascar. Methods Phylogenetic endemism (PE) is a combined measure for
   apportioning a phylogenetic tree across a landscape used to identify
   those geographical locations that contain spatially rare phylogenetic
   diversity (Rosauer etal., 2009). We present a simple extension
   (imperilled phylogenetic endemism) that scales this phylogenetic
   diversity by the probability of its loss to extinction. We apply these
   measures to a composite phylogeny of all confirmed Malagasy lemuriform
   species using International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
   extent of occurrence and threat status data. Results We find that,
   because nonimperilled species are scattered about the lemuriform tree,
   interior branches of the tree are still quite secure: this also means
   that areas of high phylogenetic endemism for Madagascar lemuriformes are
   often the same areas as those of high imperilled PE (IPE), as both are
   heavily weighted by branches nearer the tips. However, although the
   North of Madagascar holds the largest amount of spatially rare
   evolutionary history using both PE and IPE, there are additional pockets
   of imperilled history in the south and west. Main Conclusions
   Correlations of endemism and threat status with phylogenetic isolation
   are modest across lemurs and so are not substitutable conservation
   values. They might best be integrated on the landscape using IPE. As
   illustrated here, IPE successfully highlights areas containing species
   which are at once threatened with extinction and that are
   phylogenetically and spatially rare.},

Title = {Habitat shifting by the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus fulvus): a
   response to food scarcity},
Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {54},
Number = {3},
Pages = {229-235},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {During periods of food scarcity, most primates display behavioral
   responses, such as dietary switching or adjustment of traveling and
   foraging efforts, within home ranges. In rare cases, several primate
   species leave their home ranges for other remote habitats to seek
   alternative resources; this migration-like behavior is termed ``habitat
   shifting.{''} Reports of habitat shifting have concentrated on
   platyrrhines, but this behavior has rarely been observed among
   prosimians. During 1 year of observation of a troop of common brown
   lemurs (Eulemur fulvus fulvus) in Ankarafantsika National Park,
   northwestern Madagascar, habitat shifting occurred twice. To understand
   the causes of this behavior, I examined the seasonal availability of
   fruit resources in the range continuously used by the troop during the
   year (defined as the annual range) and compared feeding activities and
   vegetation types between the annual range and new areas. The troop
   usually stayed within a 38.7-ha annual range, defined by a 95 \% fixed
   kernel analysis based on GPS location data collected at 5-min intervals.
   In April 2007, the lemurs suddenly moved to a habitat 1.0-1.5 km south
   of their annual range and concentrated on the consumption of Grewia
   triflora fruits for 2 weeks. In November 2007, they visited a habitat
   0.8-1.7 km southeast of the annual range and exploited fruits of
   Landolphia myrtifolia. These new areas were open habitats with high
   densities of the respective fruit species. The density of fruiting trees
   was low in the annual range during these periods; thus, habitat shifting
   to areas with different phenological productivity appeared to be an
   effective response to fruit scarcity. Brown lemurs are generally
   categorized as a nonterritorial species, and the lemurs observed here
   showed no agonistic behavior in intergroup encounters during range
   shifting. Such nonterritoriality may allow brown lemurs to shift
   habitats, a behavior resulting in long-term absence from their annual
   range.},

   biology, especially in such a biodiversity hotspot. In particular, the
   diversity of extant lemurs is much higher than previously thought, and
   we have yet to comprehend fully the full extent of lemuriform
   biodiversity. A recent genetic analysis of mtDNA and nDNA sequence data
   in Malagasy mouse lemurs revealed the existence of several novel mtDNA
   clades based on new field sampling. These geographically defined and
   previously unrecognized mtDNA clades corresponded precisely to patterns
   of population structure revealed in the analysis of the nDNA data, thus
   confirming their evolutionary divergence from other mouse lemur clades.
   Two of these independently evolving lineages correspond to specimens
   that were collected by us in the Marolambo and Manantantely/Ivorona
   regions. Here we summarize the genetic evidence and report on the
   morphometric and external characteristics of these animals, formally
   describing them as new species. This report thus brings the number of
   currently recognized and described mouse lemur species to 20. The
   forests in which these mouse lemurs were discovered have been heavily
   degraded in the past decade, prompting the classification of one of the
   new species as Endangered by the IUCN, even before its formal
   description. As with several other newly described lemur species,
   immediate field studies and appropriate conservation actions are
   therefore urgent.},

Abstract = {Plants evolve physical defences, such as spines, against browsing
   herbivores. However, in some cases, these defences may be anachronistic
   because the principal consumers of protected parts of the plant are
   extinct. In such cases, there may be few extant species consuming
   heavily defended resources. Here we examine the spiny defences of
   Madagascar's endemic Didiereoideae, and ask whether they may be
   anachronistic. To accomplish this aim, we reviewed the literature to
   determine which species consume these plants today, and then used stable
   isotope biogeochemistry to determine who may have exploited
   Didiereoideae in the recent past. There are four major groups of
   browsers that are now extinct in Madagascar: giant lemurs, elephant
   birds (Aepyornis and Mullerornis: Aepyornithidae), pygmy hippopotamuses
   (Hippopotamus) and giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys: Testudinidae). Each
   group was evaluated for isotopic evidence of didiereoid plant
   consumption. Given the structure of members of this plant clade
   (especially Alluaudia), we predicted that lemurs would be their most
   important consumers. Three extant lemur species consume Didiereoideae.
   Several of the extinct lemurs, particularly Hadropithecus stenognathus,
   may have relied heavily on these spiny plants. None of the non-lemur
   megafaunal browsers (elephant birds, hippopotamuses and giant tortoises)
   were important consumers of Didiereoideae.},

Title = {Biological variation in a large sample of mouse lemurs from Amboasary,
   Madagascar: Implications for interpreting variation in primate biology
   and paleobiology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {64},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A thorough knowledge of biological variation in extant primates is
   imperative for interpreting variation, and for delineating species in
   primate biology and paleobiology. This is especially the case given the
   recent, rapid taxonomic expansion in many primate groups, notably among
   small-bodied nocturnal forms. Here we present data on dental, cranial,
   and pelage variation in a single-locality museum sample of mouse lemurs
   from Amboasary, Madagascar. To interpret these data, we include
   comparative information from other museum samples, and from a newly
   collected mouse lemur skeletal sample from the Beza Mahafaly Special
   Reserve (BMSR), Madagascar. We scored forty dental traits (n = 126) and
   three pelage variants (n = 19), and collected 21 cranial/dental
   measures. Most dental traits exhibit variable frequencies, with some
   only rarely present. Individual dental variants include misshapen and
   supernumerary teeth. All Amboasary pelage specimens display a ``reversed
   V{''} on the cap, and a distinct dorsal median stripe on the back. All
   but two displayed the dominant gray brown pelage coloration typical of
   Microcebus griseorufus. Cranial and dental metric variability are each
   quite low, and craniometric variation does not illustrate
   heteroscedasticity. To assess whether this sample represents a single
   species, we compared dental and pelage variation to a documented,
   single-species M. griseorufus sample from BMSR. As at Amboasary, BMSR
   mouse lemurs display limited odontometric variation and wide variation
   in non-metric dental traits. In contrast, BMSR mouse lemurs display
   diverse pelage, despite reported genetic homogeneity. Ranges of dental
   and pelage variation at BMSR and Amboasary overlap. Thus, we conclude
   that the Amboasary mouse lemurs represent a single species most likely
   (in the absence of genetic data to the contrary) M. griseorufus, and we
   reject their previous allocation to Microcebus murinus. Patterns of
   variation in the Amboasary sample provide a comparative template for
   recognizing the degree of variation manifested in a single primate
   population, and by implication, they provide minimum values for this
   species' intraspecific variation. Finally, discordance between different
   biological systems in our mouse lemur samples illustrates the need to
   examine multiple systems when conducting taxonomic analyses among living
   or fossil primates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {(Un-)Expected Nocturnal Activity in ``Diurnal{''} Lemur catta Supports
   Cathemerality as One of the Key Adaptations of the Lemurid Radiation},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {150},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-106},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The ability to operate during the day and at night (i.e., cathemerality)
   is common among mammals but has rarely been identified in primates.
   Adaptive hypotheses assume that cathemerality represents a stable
   adaptation in primates, while nonadaptive hypotheses propose that it is
   the result of an evolutionary disequilibrium arising from human impacts
   on natural habitats. Madagascar offers a unique opportunity to study the
   evolution of activity patterns as there we find a monophyletic primate
   radiation that shows nocturnal, diurnal, and cathemeral patterns.
   However, when and why cathemeral activity evolved in lemurs is the
   subject of intense debate. Thus far, this activity pattern has been
   regularly observed in only three lemurid genera but the actual number of
   lemur species exhibiting this activity is as yet unknown. Here we show
   that the ring-tailed lemur, Lemur catta, a species previously considered
   to be diurnal, can in fact be cathemeral in the wild. In neighboring but
   distinct forest areas these lemurs exhibited either mainly diurnal or
   cathemeral activity. We found that, as in other cathemeral lemurs,
   activity was entrained by photoperiod and masked by nocturnal
   luminosity. Our results confirm the relationship between transitional
   eye anatomy and physiology and 24-h activity, thus supporting the
   adaptive scenario. Also, on the basis of the most recent strepsirrhine
   phylogenetic reconstruction, using parsimony criterion, our findings
   suggest pushing back the emergence of cathemerality to stem lemurids.
   Flexible activity over 24-h could thus have been one of the key
   adaptations of the early lemurid radiation possibly driven by
   Madagascar's island ecology. Am J Phys Anthropol 150:99-106, 2013.

Title = {The Lack of Female Dominance in Golden-Brown Mouse Lemurs Suggests

Abstract = {Female dominance is a well-known trait of lemurs, although it has not
   been reported from all species and is still often unexplored, especially
   in the nocturnal species. We examined the intersexual dominance
   relationships in Microcebus ravelobensis, a congener of M. murinus who
   is well known for its female dominance. Given the many similarities in
   biology, it was predicted that M. ravelobensis should also possess
   female dominance. Seventeen unfamiliar male-female pairs were formed
   with animals captured in northwestern Madagascar and kept in a two-cage
   setting (one cage for each animal) for up to 1 week. Four encounter
   experiments were conducted with each pair. In contrast to the
   expectations, females were not consistently dominant over their male
   partners. Only 3 of 17 dyads developed a clear agonistic asymmetry,
   among which were two cases of male dominance and only one case of female
   dominance. Because body mass differences did not explain the findings,
   various other possible explanations are discussed. It is suggested that
   food may not be the driving factor of female dominance in mouse lemurs.
   Instead, it is hypothesized that species-specific differences in the
   quality of sleeping sites (i.e., tree holes) and in social grouping
   patterns may better explain why some mouse lemur species have female
   dominance, whereas others like the golden-brown mouse lemur do not. It
   is concluded that these arguments and hypotheses may even hold true for
   other solitary foragers and may thereby lead to a better understanding
   of the variable social evolution in lemurs and primates in general. Am J

Abstract = {Community-wide seasonal fruiting and seed dispersal by the common brown
   lemur (Eulemur fulvus fulvus) was investigated in a tropical dry forest,
   north-western Madagascar. The brown lemur is the sole disperser of large
   seeds > 10 mm in diameter. Considering the limited assemblage of
   dispersers, large-seeded plants should display distinctive fruiting
   patterns to acquire dispersers. To compare fruiting patterns and seed
   dispersal by the brown lemur between small-seeded and large-seeded
   plants, fruiting conditions for 432 trees on a transect, feeding
   activity over 1212 h of observation, and the composition of 1126 dung
   samples were recorded for 1 y. Seeds of a total of 52 species were
   identified through both observations and faecal analysis. As rainfall
   increased, larger numbers of species and individuals of small-seeded
   plants fruited. Among the 52 species, the brown lemur dispersed 29 and
   13 species with small and large seeds, respectively, during the rainy
   season. High moisture levels probably favoured seed germination and
   seedling establishment in various species. During the dry season,
   although small-seeded species rarely fruited, a few large-seeded
   species, particularly Vitex beraviensis, formed a long-term fruiting
   peak and provided essential food resources for the brown lemur. Because
   seeds of these large-seeded plants were frequently dispersed by the
   brown lemur, dry-season fruiting seemed to be favourable to avoid
   competition for dispersers with other plant species.},

Abstract = {In the Ankarafantsika tropical dry forest (northwestern Madagascar), the
   common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus fulvus) is the largest frugivore and
   probably the sole disperser of large-seeded plants (seed diameter > 10
   mm). To investigate seed dispersal by this primate, I recorded the
   feeding activities of a troop; also conducted fecal analyses,
   germination trials on defecated seeds, and a vegetation survey over 1 yr
   (beginning Dec 2006). Brown lemurs mostly consumed fruit (68\%). The
   fruit of Vitex beraviensis was the most exploited resource (21\% of
   total feeding time). Among dung samples, 1126 contained intact seeds of
   70 plant species, with a median of six seeds and two species per sample.
   These data indicate that the brown lemur population dispersed
   approximately 9854 seeds/km2/d. Although the number of annually
   defecated seeds was overwhelmingly the largest in Grewia triflora, many
   of the small seeds were often clumped in dung piles. In contrast, large
   seeds of V. beraviensis occurred in the largest number of dung samples.
   The rate and time of seed germination in V. beraviensis were improved by
   passage through brown lemur guts. Therefore, V. beraviensis may readily
   establish seedlings in sites of brown lemur fecal deposition. Vitex
   beraviensis and brown lemurs are probably involved in a strong
   mutualism. Twenty-three large-seeded plants were probably dependent on
   brown lemurs for seed dispersal and some of these species were common
   trees in the forest. Maintenance of these key plantanimal interactions
   will probably contribute to the conservation of species diversity and
   intact regeneration of the Ankarafantsika forest.},

Title = {Scratching around mating: factors affecting anxiety in wild Lemur catta},
Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {247-254},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Scratching has been successfully used to detect anxiety, a proxy for
   stress, in primates, from strepsirrhines to Homo sapiens. Here, we
   investigated the fluctuation of scratching in Lemur catta during the
   mating season. In particular we evaluated whether scratching (1) varied
   according to sex and rank differences, (2) increased in the period of
   maximum stress (around the mating days), and (3) was reduced by
   grooming. At Berenty (South Madagascar), we followed two lemur groups
   (23 adult/subadult individuals) and gathered data on self-scratching,
   aggression, and grooming. Based on perineal area features, we recognized
   two periods: low swelling (LS), with no estrus female, and high swelling
   (HS), when at least one female was in estrus. We predicted that
   aggressive behaviors and anxiety-related scratching would covary.
   Indeed, scratching peaked in HS, when aggression was also highest. In
   agreement with previous literature, this result suggests that conflicts
   around estrus days may raise anxiety levels in the social group. We
   expected scratching levels to be highest in males because they
   aggressively compete for females and are subject to mate choice and
   repeated attacks by dominant females. Instead, the scratching rates were
   similar in males and females, probably because the high competition,
   which involves both sexes, dampened intersexual differences. In contrast
   to our prediction, scratching was not rank dependent, probably because
   animal ranking positions changed from LS to HS. Finally, we showed that,
   in ring-tailed lemurs, as well as in other primates, scratching
   decreases after reciprocal grooming in both periods. This finding
   provides the first evidence that grooming could assist in reducing
   anxiety in strepsirrhines.},

Volume = {148},

Abstract = {The common morphological metrics of size, shape, and enamel thickness of
   teeth are believed to reflect the functional requirements of a primate's
   diet. However, the mechanical and material properties of enamel also
   contribute to tooth function, yet are rarely studied. Substantial wear
   and tooth loss previously documented in Lemur catta at the Beza Mahafaly
   Special Reserve suggests that their dental morphology, structure, and
   possibly their enamel are not adapted for their current fallback food
   (the mechanically challenging tamarind fruit). In this study, we
   investigate the nanomechanical properties, mineralization, and
   microstructure of the enamel of three sympatric lemur species to provide
   insight into their dietary functional adaptations. Mechanical properties
   measured by nanoindentation were compared to measurements of mineral
   content, prism orientation, prism size, and enamel thickness using
   electron microscopy. Mechanical properties of all species were similar
   near the enamel dentin junction and variations correlated with changes
   in microstructure (e.g., prism size) and mineral content. Severe wear
   and microcracking within L. catta's enamel were associated with up to a
   43\% reduction in nanomechanical properties in regions of cracking
   versus intact enamel. The mechanical and material properties of L.
   catta's enamel are similar to those of sympatric folivores and suggest
   that they are not uniquely mechanically adapted to consume the
   physically challenging tamarind fruit. An understanding of the material
   and mechanical properties of enamel is required to fully elucidate the
   functional and ecological adaptations of primate teeth. Am J Phys

Abstract = {Understanding the paleoecology of extinct subfossil lemurs requires
   reconstruction of dietary preferences. Tooth morphology is strongly
   correlated with diet in living primates and is appropriate for inferring
   dietary ecology. Recently, dental topographic analysis has shown great
   promise in reconstructing diet from molar tooth form. Compared with
   traditionally used shearing metrics, dental topography is better suited
   for the extraordinary diversity of tooth form among subfossil lemurs and
   has been shown to be less sensitive to phylogenetic sources of shape
   variation. Specifically, we computed orientation patch counts rotated
   (OPCR) and Dirichlet normal energy (DNE) of molar teeth belonging to 14
   species of subfossil lemurs and compared these values to those of an
   extant lemur sample. The two metrics succeeded in separating species in
   a manner that provides insights into both food processing and diet. We
   used them to examine the changes in lemur community ecology in Southern
   and Southwestern Madagascar that accompanied the extinction of giant
   lemurs. We show that the poverty of Madagascar's frugivore community is
   a long-standing phenomenon and that extinction of large-bodied lemurs in
   the South and Southwest resulted not merely in a loss of guild elements
   but also, most likely, in changes in the ecology of extant lemurs. Am J

Title = {The impact of dental impairment on ring-tailed lemur food processing
   performance},

Volume = {148},
Number = {2},
Pages = {238-248},

Abstract = {During mastication, foods are reduced into particles suitable for
   swallowing and digestion. Smaller particles possess a greater surface
   area per unit of volume on which digestive enzymes and bacteria may work
   than relatively larger particles, and are thus more readily digested. As
   dental morphology facilitates the breakdown of diets with specific
   mechanical properties, extensive dental wear and/or tooth loss may
   impede an individual's ability to break down and exploit foods. We
   present data demonstrating a relationship between dental impairment and
   particle size in 43 fecal samples from 33 ring-tailed lemurs at the Beza
   Mahafaly Special Reserve (BMSR), Madagascar. All fecal samples were
   sifted through three sieves of decreasing size (11.2 mm, 4.75 mm, and
   1.0 mm). The resulting fraction in each sieve was then weighed and
   assessed in relation to individual dental impairment status. With
   increasing wear, the percentage of each sample within the 1.0 mm sieve
   decreases, whereas that in the 11.2 mm sieve increases with increasing
   postcanine wear, although these effects are not present when limited to
   individuals without tooth loss. Individuals with tooth loss also
   demonstrate larger proportions of fecal material 1.04.75 mm in size.
   Dental impairment results in larger food particles and potentially less
   efficient utilization of foods. When fecal material was examined by leaf
   vs. fruit content, individuals with tooth loss demonstrated reduced
   proportions of fruit in the 1.0 mm and 11.2 mm sieves. These data
   suggest individuals with tooth loss consume less fruit than those
   without loss, potentially reflecting a reduced ability to process
   tamarind fruit, a key fallback resource at BMSR. Am J Phys Anthropol

Title = {Anatomy is important, but need not be destiny: Novel uses of the thumb
   in aye-ayes compared to other lemurs},

Abstract = {Aye-ayes (Daubentonia madagascerensis) have highly specialized hands
   with long digits, especially the thin middle one (D3), which is used for
   extracting food, such as beetle larvae, under bark. Due to the
   elongation of their fingers, including the thumb, it is presumed that
   aye-ayes have a rather limited capacity for delicate manipulation of
   objects. However, studies have reported independent movement of digits
   D3 and D4, and one report noted a seemingly independent thumb (D1)
   movement in holding food. Sixteen captive adult aye-ayes were videotaped
   feeding on a diverse range of foods so as to document how the thumb is
   used during food holding. To determine if the patterns observed were
   unique to aye-ayes, 24 individuals from 9 other species of lemurs were
   also videotaped. Two patterns of thumb use idiosyncratic to aye-ayes and
   one other lemur, the sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi), were identified:
   (1) when holding a food item in one hand, the thumb was used to secure
   the food, with the other digits playing a secondary role; (2) when
   holding a food item with both hands, the thumbs once again took a
   predominant role in securing the food. In the majority of these cases,
   whether held by one or two thumbs, the thumbs curled around the item,
   but some descriptive evidence is provided that suggests that aye-ayes
   exaggerate the role of the thumbs by shifting the hold to the outer
   edge. The novel uses of the thumbs in aye-ayes demonstrate that brain
   mechanisms can sometimes override the behavioral (or motor) limitations
   imposed by the morphology of the body. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Phylogeny: An Empirical Demonstration of the Effect of Allele Sampling

Abstract = {The systematics and speciation literature is rich with discussion
   relating to the potential for gene tree/species tree discordance.
   Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to generate discordance,
   including differential selection, long-branch attraction, gene
   duplication, genetic introgression, and/or incomplete lineage sorting.
   For speciose clades in which divergence has occurred recently and
   rapidly, recovering the true species tree can be particularly
   problematic due to incomplete lineage sorting. Unfortunately, the
   availability of multilocus or ``phylogenomic{''} data sets does not
   simply solve the problem, particularly when the data are analyzed with
   standard concatenation techniques. In our study, we conduct a
   phylogenetic study for a nearly complete species sample of the dwarf and
   mouse lemur clade, Cheirogaleidae. Mouse lemurs (genus, Microcebus) have
   been intensively studied over the past decade for reasons relating to
   their high level of cryptic species diversity, and although there has
   been emerging consensus regarding the evolutionary diversity contained
   within the genus, there is no agreement as to the inter-specific
   relationships within the group. We attempt to resolve cheirogaleid
   phylogeny, focusing especially on the mouse lemurs, by employing a large
   multilocus data set. We compare the results of Bayesian concordance
   methods with those of standard gene concatenation, finding that though
   concatenation yields the strongest results as measured by statistical
   support, these results are found to be highly misleading. By employing
   an approach where individual alleles are treated as operational
   taxonomic units, we show that phylogenetic results are substantially
   influenced by the selection of alleles in the concatenation process.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of both population size and genetic diversity is critical for
   assessing extinction risk but few studies include concurrent estimates
   of these two components of population biology. We conducted an
   investigation of population density and size, and genetic variation and
   past demographic events, of the Endangered grey-headed lemur Eulemur
   cinereiceps in south-east Madagascar. We estimated lemur density using
   line-transect surveys and used satellite imagery to calculate forest
   fragment area in three localities. We collected tissue samples from 53
   individuals and used 26 polymorphic microsatellite loci to obtain
   measures of population structure (divergence and diversity) across these
   localities. We tested the probability of past bottleneck events using
   three models. Contrary to expectation, there were no significant
   differences in population density across localities. Genetic diversity
   decreased, but not significantly, with decreasing habitat area and
   population size. We found a higher likelihood of past bottleneck events
   in the fragmented coastal populations. The low population size and prior
   decline in diversity in coastal patches are consistent with their
   isolation, anthropogenic disturbance, and exposure to cyclone activity.
   The similarities in the estimates of density between continuous and
   fragmented sites may indicate recent population growth in the fragments
   but these populations nevertheless remain at risk from reduced levels of
   genetic variation. These patterns should be confirmed with more
   extensive sampling across the limited range of E. cinereiceps.},

Title = {Variance-sensitive choice in lemurs: constancy trumps quantity},
Journal = {ANIMAL COGNITION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-25},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated that animals' tolerance for risk when
   foraging can be affected by changes in metabolic state. Specifically,
   animals on a negative energy budget increase their preferences for risk,
   while animals on a positive energy budget are typically risk-averse. The
   malleability of these preferences may be evolutionarily advantageous,
   and important for maximizing chances of survival during brief periods of
   energetic stress. However, animals adapted to living in unpredictable
   conditions are unlikely to benefit from risk-seeking strategies, and
   instead are expected to reduce energetic demands while maintaining
   risk-aversion. We measured risk preferences in lemurs, a group of
   primates restricted to the island of Madagascar. Lemurs have evolved
   diverse anatomical and behavioral traits for survival in a harsh and
   unpredictable ecology, and these traits have been explained as forms of
   anatomical and behavioral risk reduction. We therefore predicted that
   lemurs would also be risk-averse in a behavioral task that offered
   subjects a choice between a small certain reward, and an uncertain but
   potentially large reward. In Experiment 1, the average rewards
   associated with the constant and variable options were equal and lemurs
   exhibited high levels of risk-aversion, replicating a phenomenon that
   has been demonstrated in dozens of taxa. In Experiment 2, we gradually
   increased the average value of the variable option relative to the
   constant option. Lemurs' preferences tracked these changes and subjects
   became more risk-seeking as the risk premium increased. However, many
   subjects maintained high levels of risk-aversion even when the average
   payout of the variable option yielded double that of the constant
   option. These results are consistent with the notion that lemur
   cognition has evolved to minimize risk in an unpredictable island
   environment.},

Title = {A Genome Sequence Resource for the Aye-Aye (Daubentonia

Abstract = {We present a high-coverage draft genome assembly of the aye-aye
   (Daubentonia madagascariensis), a highly unusual nocturnal primate from
   Madagascar. Our assembly totals; similar to 3.0 billion bp (3.0 Gb),
   roughly the size of the human genome, comprised of similar to 2.6
   million scaffolds (N50 scaffold size = 13,597 bp) based on short
   paired-end sequencing reads. We compared the aye-aye genome sequence
   data with four other published primate genomes (human, chimpanzee,
   orangutan, and rhesus macaque) as well as with the mouse and dog genomes
   as nonprimate outgroups. Unexpectedly, we observed strong evidence for a
   relatively slow substitution rate in the aye-aye lineage compared with
   these and other primates. In fact, the aye-aye branch length is
   estimated to be similar to 10\% shorter than that of the human lineage,
   which is known for its low substitution rate. This finding may be
   explained, in part, by the protracted aye-aye life-history pattern,
   including late weaning and age of first reproduction relative to other
   lemurs. Additionally, the availability of this draft lemur genome
   sequence allowed us to polarize nucleotide and protein sequence changes
   to the ancestral primate lineage-a critical period in primate evolution,
   for which the relevant fossil record is sparse. Finally, we identified
   293,800 high-confidence single nucleotide polymorphisms in the donor
   individual for our aye-aye genome sequence, a captive-born individual
   from two wild-born parents. The resulting heterozygosity estimate of
   0.051\% is the lowest of any primate studied to date, which is
   understandable considering the aye-aye's extensive home-range size and
   relatively low population densities. Yet this level of genetic diversity
   also suggests that conservation efforts benefiting this unusual species
   should be prioritized, especially in the face of the accelerating
   degradation and fragmentation of Madagascar's forests.},

   LEMURS (LEMUR CATTA)},

Abstract = {Wild ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) can be anesthetized with Telazol
   via blow dart, but improved techniques are needed so that each lemur is
   reliably induced with a single dart. Medetomidine-butorphanol (MB) is a
   good supplemental protocol to be administered once the lemurs are
   captured, but other protocols may provide longer periods of sedation and
   immobility. One possible way of increasing the efficacy of each dart is
   to increase the time it is retained in the leg. In this investigation, a
   ``double-sleeve{''} technique was used to try to increase the time of
   dart retention. This technique used a standard silicone sleeve on the
   needle, along with a second sleeve at the needle hub. Induction values
   were compared between lemurs darted with double-sleeve needles and those
   induced with needles that each had a single silicone sleeve. Once the
   lemurs were induced, supplementation with MB (0.04 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg)
   was compared with supplementation with ketamine-medetomidine (KM) (10
   mg/kg and 0.04 mg/kg). Twenty-three lemurs were darted with Telazol by
   using single-sleeve needles, and 24 were darted with double-sleeve
   needles. The number of darts per lemur and number of escapes were not
   different between animals darted with a single sleeve compared with a
   double-sleeve; thus, there were no significant improvements in induction
   success with the double-sleeve technique. Adequate sedation and muscle
   relaxation were achieved with both MB and KM; however, lemurs that
   received MB were more relaxed and needed fewer additional supplements
   that those that received KM. Single-sleeve dart needles are recommended
   for Telazol induction of ring-tailed lemurs via blow dart and MB is
   preferable to KM for supplemental sedation and muscle relaxation.},

Abstract = {Affiliation/agonism and social dominance are central factors determining
   social organization in primates. The aim of our study is to investigate
   and describe, for the first time, the intersexual relations in a
   nocturnal and cohesive pair-living prosimian primate, the western woolly
   lemur (Avahi occidentalis), and to determine to what extent phylogeny,
   activity mode, or the cohesiveness of pair partners shape the quality of
   social interactions. Six pairs of western woolly lemurs were
   radio-collared in the dry deciduous forest of northwestern Madagascar.
   More than 874 hr of focal animal sampling were conducted. All
   occurrences of social interactions involving a focal animal were
   recorded. The rate of affiliation between pair partners was
   significantly higher than the rate of agonism. Western woolly lemur
   pairs' interactions were extremely peaceful. All decided agonistic
   conflicts (N = 15) were exclusively initiated and won by the female. No
   female showed spontaneous submission toward her male partner. These
   results are in line with those of diurnal cohesive pair-living
   anthropoid primates. Findings support the hypothesis that social
   relations in pair-living primates are linked to the cohesiveness of pair
   partners in time and space irrespective of phylogeny and activity mode.

Title = {Nocturnal ranging by a diurnal primate: are ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur
   catta) cathemeral?},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {201-205},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Cathemerality, an activity pattern comprised of distinct periods of
   diurnal and nocturnal activity, is a trait found among several of the
   Malagasy strepsirhines and one species of Aotus. Because occasional
   anecdotal reports suggest that some diurnal primates can be active at
   night, I investigated the possibility of nocturnal ranging behavior in
   the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) by using global positioning system
   (GPS) collars programmed to collect data across a 24-h period. Five
   individuals in a provisioned, free-ranging L. catta colony on St.
   Catherines Island, Georgia, USA, wore GPS collars across 1 week of the
   mating season. Results revealed that night ranging behavior occurred
   between the h of 1900 and 0530. An evaluation of the effect of moonlight
   on nocturnal activity showed that a greater rate of travel occurred
   during moonlit periods as opposed to periods when the moon had not yet
   risen. Distance travelled at night decreased across the deployment
   period, likely because of a decrease in available moonlight over time,
   as the lemurs were collared during a waning moon. Fewer mating
   opportunities over time may have also been responsible for the decrease
   in night ranging, because the number of females in estrus declined
   across the deployment period. Future research is needed to separate the
   effects of moonlight and mating activity on night ranging in this
   species, as well as to evaluate whether L. catta in Madagascar show
   night ranging similar to L. catta on SCI. These data raise the
   possibility that L. catta may be cathemeral, with an activity pattern
   fluctuating between diurnality and cathemerality in accordance with
   shifts in environmental conditions.},

Title = {Evidence from four lemur species that ringtailed lemur social cognition

Abstract = {Many haplorhine primates flexibly exploit social cues when competing for
   food. Whether strepsirrhine primates possess similar abilities is
   unknown. To explore the phylogenetic origins of such skills among
   primates, we tested ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, for their ability to
   exploit social cues while competing for food. We found that in two
   contexts ringtailed lemurs spontaneously approached food out of their
   competitor's view. To assess whether these skills are related to the
   relatively complex social structure seen in ringtailed lemurs or shared
   more broadly across a range of strepsirrhines, we then compared
   ringtailed lemurs to three lemur species with less complex societies in
   the same food competition task (N = 50 lemurs). Although all species
   skilfully avoided food proximate to a competitor in a pretest, only
   ringtailed lemurs performed above chance in the food competition task
   that required subjects to avoid food that an experimenter was facing in
   favour of one that he was not facing. We also compared all four species
   in a noncompetitive gaze-following task. Ringtailed lemurs were again
   the only species that looked up more frequently when an experimenter
   gazed into space than when an experimenter gazed forward (although at
   relatively low frequencies). These results are consistent with the
   hypothesis that ringtailed lemurs have undergone convergent
   social-cognitive evolution with haplorhines, possibly as an adaptation
   for living in the largest and most complex social groups among
   strepsirrhines. Results are discussed in terms of lemur cognitive
   evolution as well as the social intelligence hypothesis. (C) 2011 The

Abstract = {The size of the infraorbital foramen (IOF) has been used in drawing both
   phylogenetic and ecological inferences regarding fossil taxa. Within the
   order Primates, frugivores have relatively larger IOFs than folivores or
   insectivores. This study uses relative IOF size in lemurs to test prior
   trophic inferences for subfossil lemurs and to explore the pattern of
   variation within and across lemur families. The IOFs of individuals
   belonging to 12 extinct lemur species were measured and compared to
   those of extant Malagasy strepsirhines. Observations matched
   expectations drawn from more traditional approaches (e. g. dental
   morphology and microwear, stable isotope analysis) remarkably well. We
   confirm that extinct lemurs belonging to the families Megaladapidae and
   Palaeopropithecidae were predominantly folivorous and that species
   belonging to the genus Pachylemur (Lemuridae) were frugivores. Very high
   values for relative IOF area in Archaeolemur support frugivory but are
   also consistent with omnivory, as certain omnivores use facial touch
   cues while feeding. These results provide additional evidence that the
   IOF can be used as an informative osteological feature in both
   phylogenetic and paleoecological interpretations of the fossil record.

Abstract = {Telazol (R) has been commonly used for field anesthesia of wild lemurs,
   including ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). Telazol alone provides good
   induction, but doesn't cause adequate muscle relaxation and sedation for
   collecting consistent somatic measurements and high-quality dental
   impressions that are sometimes needed. Variability in induction response
   has been seen between individuals that have received similar dosages,
   with young lemurs seeming to need more anesthetic than mature lemurs.
   This investigation evaluated Telazol induction in young (2.0-4.9 yr) and
   mature (>= 5.0 yr) ring-tailed lemurs and compared postinduction
   supplementation with medetomidine or medetomidine-butorphanol.
   Forty-eight lemurs were anesthetized with Telazol administered via blow
   dart; then, 20 min after darting, they were supplemented via hand
   injection with either medetomidine (0.04 mg/kg) or medetomidine
   butorphanol (0.04 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively). The odds ratio for
   young lemurs to need more than one dart for induction, relative to
   mature lemurs, was 3.8, even though the initial dose of Telazol received
   by young lemurs (19 +/- 7 mg/kg) was significantly higher than the
   initial dose administered to mature lemurs (12 +/- 5 mg/kg). The total
   Telazol dosage was also significantly different between young lemurs (33
   +/- 15 mg/kg) and mature lemurs (18 +/- 9 mg/kg). Both medetomidine and
   medetomidinc butorphanol provided good muscle relaxation and sedation
   for all procedures. Physiologic values were similar between the two
   protocols. Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was generally good,
   although there were a few SaO(2) values < 90\%. Recoveries were smooth,
   but long. Time to head up was correlated with total Telazol dosage in
   mature lemurs. In young lemurs, time to standing was correlated with
   Telazol induction dosage and time of last Telazol administration. Lemurs
   that received hand injections of Telazol took longer to recover than
   those that did not. Further refinements are needed to increase induction
   reliability and to decrease recovery time, particularly in young lemurs.},

Abstract = {The study of southern dry forest lemurs has been largely restricted to
   small reserves; yet, the majority of the region's lemur populations
   reside outside protected areas. Lemur catta and Propithecus verreauxi
   occupy the same forests but have different dietary preferences. This
   study assessed L. catta and P. verreauxi population densities across a
   3-km dry forest gradient (1,539 ha) in southern Madagascar. The study
   was designed to allow lemur densities to be related to particular forest
   types. A particular aim of this study was to collect lemur data in both
   protected and unprotected areas. Density estimates were calculated using
   point transect distance sampling in a study area that contained the Beza
   Mahafaly Special Reserve and the adjacent disturbed forests. The highest
   densities recorded for each species were in the protected area where the
   two species were most segregated in their distribution, with L. catta
   density highest in gallery forest type and P. verreauxi density highest
   in dry deciduous. Densities of both species varied widely outside the
   protected area, but P. verreauxi density was more uniform than was L.
   catta. Results of this study indicate that patterns of lemur density in
   protected areas are not representative of patterns in disturbed forests;
   this also suggests that we cannot fully understand the ecological
   constraints facing primate species by studying them only in protected
   areas. This research highlights the value of pairing the study of
   landscape-level patterns of species distribution with both local
   ground-level ecological interpretations and broad-scale satellite data;
   information from only one level may give an incomplete view of the
   community. Am. J. Primatol. 73:38-52, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Efforts to understand the variation in primate social systems and their
   underlying interaction patterns have focused on both intrinsic and
   extrinsic factors. In the socioecological model, food distribution and
   abundance have been argued to be the primary influences on the social
   behavior of primate species. We examined the relationship of food
   resources and two intrinsic factors-kinship and proximity-with patterns
   of affiliative and agonistic relationships in two semi-free ranging
   ringtailed lemur, Lemur catta, social groups (N-14) at The Duke Lemur
   Center in Durham, NC. In analyzing these three factors concurrently
   within the same system, we attempt to establish their relative power in
   explaining the characteristics of social relationships. Patterns of
   affiliation and high-intensity agonism were best explained by kinship.
   Proximity also explained affiliation but did not explain agonism, which
   varied considerably between groups. The influence of food on social
   interactions was highly variable between the two groups and, therefore,
   did not convincingly account for the social behavior patterns we
   observed. Finally, different intensities of agonism have different
   patterns and should be analyzed individually. The variation between
   social groups makes it difficult for us to conclude that any one factor
   is primarily and universally responsible for patterns of social behavior
   in this species. Am. J. Primatol. 72:981-991, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {Several recent studies of animals in their natural surroundings found
   evidence for effects of certain major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
   immune gene alleles on the parasite load. However, in multi-infected
   individuals the particular selection pressure exerted by specific
   parasites has rarely been explored. In this study we took advantage of
   the parasitological and genetic data of two previously investigated
   Malagasy lemur species (Cheirogaleus medius and Microcebus murinus). We
   investigated whether the two sympatric and ecologically similar primates
   are infected by similar parasite species and explored if certain
   parasites are associated with particular MHC alleles. Our study revealed
   that most of the parasite egg morphotypes were found in both hosts. In
   each lemur species we identified one MHC allele which was positively
   associated with Ascaris-infection. Interestingly, these MHC alleles were
   very similar to each other but differed from all other investigated MHC
   alleles in an amino acid substitution in a putative functional important
   antigen binding site. Thus, our study gives first intriguing evidence
   for a direct connection between certain antigen binding sites of MHC
   molecules with a particular parasite in two wild primate populations.
   This may indicate that indeed certain parasites exert direct selective
   pressure on the MHC of wild living hosts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot, well known for its endemic
   primates, the lemurs. Numbers of recognized lemur species have increased
   drastically in some genera (e.g. Microcebus), while field-based studies
   revealed low species diversity in the dwarf lemurs (genus Cheirogaleus).
   Only three (C. medius, C. major, C. crossleyi) of seven described
   species have to date been identified in field-based studies. Blanco et
   al. (2009) reported two sympatric Cheirogaleus species at Tsinjoarivo
   based on morphological data, one of which they attributed to C.
   crossleyi and the other of which they described as C. sibreei-like, or
   possibly a new species. Based on comparative analyses of mtDNA (cytb)
   and nDNA (vWF, fiba, adora3), we confirm the presence of C. crossleyi
   and show that the C. sibreei-like individuals form a well-defined fourth
   clade, basal to the three recognized species. Whereas these molecular
   analyses demonstrate that a non-holotype museum specimen considered by
   Groves (2000) to belong to C. .sibreei does not cluster with the C.
   sibreei-like individuals from Tsinjoarivo, morphometric analysis of one
   Tsinjoarivo individual, the C. sibreei holotype from Ankeramadinika, and
   samples of C medius, C. major, and C. crossleyi strongly suggests that
   the fourth (and basal) clade is indeed C. sibreei. Tsinjoarivo therefore
   becomes the only known field site harboring C. sibreei today. Given
   ongoing forest loss and fragmentation at Tsinjoarivo we can surmise that
   this population, critical to our understanding of the evolution of the
   genus Cheirogaleus, is also critically endangered. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {Humans (Homo sapiens) anticipate the consequences of their forthcoming
   actions. For example, they grasp objects with uncomfortable grasps to
   afford comfortable end positions-the end-state comfort (ESC) effect.
   When did such sophisticated motor planning abilities emerge in
   evolution? We addressed this question by asking whether humans' most
   distant living primate relatives-lemurs-also exhibit the ESC effect. We
   presented 6 species of lemurs (Lemur catta. Eulemur mongoz, Eulemur
   coronatus, Eulemur collaris, Hapalemur griseus, and Varecia rubra) with
   a food extraction task and measured the grasp used-either a canonical
   thumb-up posture or a noncanonical thumb-down posture. The lemurs
   adopted the thumb-down posture when that hand position afforded a
   thumb-up posture following object transport, thereby exhibiting the ESC
   effect. We conclude that the planning abilities underlying the ESC
   effect evolved at least 65 million years ago, or 25 million years
   earlier than previously supposed based on an earlier demonstration of
   the ESC effect in cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus; Weiss, Wark, \&
   Rosenbaum, 2007). Because neither cotton-tops nor lemurs are tool users,
   the data suggest that the cognitive abilities implicated by the ESC
   effect are not sufficient, although they may be necessary, for tool use.},

Abstract = {Habitat fragmentation may strongly reduce individuals' dispersal among
   resource patches and hence influence population distribution and
   persistence. We studied the impact of landscape heterogeneity on the
   dispersal of the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), an
   endangered social lemur species living in a restricted and highly
   fragmented landscape. We combined spatial analysis and population
   genetics methods to describe population units and identify the
   environmental factors which best predict the rates and patterns of
   genetic differentiation within and between populations. We used
   non-invasive methods to genotype 230 individuals at 13 microsatellites
   in all the main forest fragments of its entire distribution area. Our
   analyses suggest that the Manankolana River and geographical distance
   are the primary structuring factors, while a national road crossing the
   region does not seem to impede gene flow. Altogether, our results are in
   agreement with a limited influence of forest habitat connectivity on
   gene flow patterns (except for North of the species' range), suggesting
   that dispersal is still possible today among most forest patches for
   this species. Within forest patches, we find that dispersal is mainly
   among neighbouring social groups, hence confirming previous behavioural
   observations.},

Abstract = {For more than 20 years, a species of Palaeopropithecus has been
   suspected in the North-West of Madagascar. New discoveries in breccia
   from the sites of Belobaka and Ambongonambakoa permit us to describe the
   dental morphology of a new species, with a very developed parastyle and
   a mesostyle. This morphology is close to that which is found in the
   genus Propithecus. This small sized Palaeopropithecus Could probably
   chew little bits of harder food than the two larger species. The
   description of this new species occurs 100 years after the other two,
   and suggests a greater diversity of Palaeopropithecus, extinct lemurs of
   large size and moving in a suspended manner like the South-American
   sloth. To cite this article: D. Gommery et al., C. R. Palevol 8 (2009).

Abstract = {Urine marking has been neglected in prosimian primates. Captive studies
   showed that the Malagasy prosimian Lemur catta scent marks with urine,
   as well as via specialized depositions. L. catta urine mark, a
   multimodal signal, differs from simple urination in terms of different
   design features, including tail configuration: the tail is held up
   during marking (UT-up) and down during urination (UT-down). We explore
   economy and function of UT-up in the female dominant L. catta. We
   collected 240 h of observations on one group at Berenty (south
   Madagascar) during the nonmating period via all occurrences sampling. We
   gathered behavioral bouts/contexts (marking, traveling, feeding,
   resting, and fights) and recorded 191 UT-ups and 79 UT-downs. Via Global
   Positioning System we established the location of the places frequented
   i) by extragroup individuals and ii) by group members, in this case
   recording also behavioral context and time spent in each place. We found
   that L. catta UT-up is not an artifact of captivity. Moreover, UT-up in
   the nonmating period plays a role in territorial defense, which is
   mostly performed by females in L. catta society. Female UT-ups were the
   most investigated and UT-ups were performed/investigated more by
   females. Finally, signal use is parsimonious, in that urine is
   economically placed where and when detection probability by competitors
   is higher. UT-ups were performed in places most frequented by extragroup
   individuals and in presence of extragroup competitors (nonrandom
   topography and timing). In conclusion, we suggest that UT-up is an
   economical signal with a primarily territorial function. Am J Phys

Title = {Dominance Rank Reversals and Rank Instability Among Male Lemur catta:
   The Effects of Female Behavior and Ejaculation},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},

Volume = {138},
Number = {3},
Pages = {293-305},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this study, dominance rank instability among male Lemur catta during
   mating was investigated. Also, data on agonism and sexual behavior
   across five consecutive mating seasons in a population of L. catta on
   St. Catherines Island, USA, were collected. Instances of male rank
   instability were categorized into three types. Type I consisted of a
   temporary switch in the dominance ranks of two males, which lasted for a
   per riod of minutes or hours. Type 2 dyadic male agonistic interactions
   showed highly variable outcomes for a period of time during which wins
   and losses were neither predictable nor consistent. Type 3 interactions
   consisted of a single agonistic win by a lower-ranked male over a more
   dominant male. More Type 2 interactions (indicating greater dominance
   instability) occurred when males had not spent the previous mating
   season in the same group, but this trend was not statistically
   significant. The majority of periods of male rank instability were
   preceded by female proceptivity or receptivity directed to a
   lower-ranked male. As such, exhibition of female mate choice for a
   lower-ranking male appeared to incite male-male competition. Following
   receipt of female proceptivity or receptivity, males who were
   lower-ranking took significantly longer to achieve their first agonistic
   win over a more dominant male than did males who were higher-ranked.
   Ejaculation frequently preceded loss of dominance. In conclusion,
   temporary rank reversals and overall dominance rank instability commonly
   occur among male L. catta in mating contexts, and these temporary
   increases in dominance status appear to positively affect male mating
   success. Am J Phys Anthropol 138:293-305, 2009. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss,

Title = {Proximate and ultimate determinants of cathemeral activity in brown
   lemurs},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {317-325},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Among primates, only two lemur genera, Eulemur and Hapalemur, and a
   population of the platyrrhine Aotus azarai are known to be cathemeral
   (i.e. show a mixture of daytime and night-time activity). Given the
   rarity of this phenomenon in primates except for Malagasy lemurs, its
   proximate and ultimate factors are still debated. The adaptive reasons
   for this apparently odd lifestyle are mainly based on four not mutually
   exclusive hypotheses: thermoregulatory benefits, antipredator strategy,
   competition avoidance and metabolic dietary-related needs. However,
   little effort has been made to tease apart proximate cues from potential
   ultimate factors in the multivariate context of activity correlates. To
   investigate these hypotheses, we compared the year-round cathemeral
   activity of two groups of Eulemur collaris and one group of hybrids E.
   collaris x Eulemur fulvus rufus in a humid littoral and in a dry gallery
   forest of southern Madagascar. Data were collected using a 5 min
   instantaneous method, with sampling equally distributed between day and
   night. We weighted the different effects of proximate and ultimate
   factors via the ANCOVA analysis using as the dependent variable the
   ratio between diurnal and nocturnal activity. Photoperiodic changes and
   nocturnal luminosity were the two proximate factors that accounted for
   most of the variability at the two sites. Diet quality was the only
   ultimate factor that had a significant effect on the diurnality index of
   the two lemur populations, suggesting a role of metabolic
   dietary-related needs in determining cathemeral activity in these
   lemurs. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {We compared diets and female feeding agonism in 2 groups of ring-tailed
   lemurs living in markedly diverse microhabitats in and near the Beza
   Mahafaly Reserve, Madagascar during mid-to-late gestation periods and
   height of the dry season to test predictions concerning differences in
   resource availability, preferred foods, female rank, and degree and
   frequency of feeding agonism in relation to usurpability and
   monopolization of food resources. Quadrat sampling in disturbed forest
   habitat revealed a greater number of plant species than in the gallery
   forest home range area, but females in both groups consumed nearly equal
   numbers of actual food plant species. Higher-ranking females in
   disturbed forest consumed human food scraps from the researchers camp
   significantly more often than low-ranking females did, while there was
   no rank effect for consumption of any food type between females in the
   gallery forest group. Higher rates of female feeding agonism in both
   groups occurred around usurpable fruit and leaves, as well as over
   monopolizable human food scraps in the disturbed forest group. There is
   no association between degree of agonism and food type in either group,
   and rate of feeding agonism is similar for both groups. The most highly
   contested food items came in large packages and were high in nutrients:
   beneficial foods for gestating females in the height of dry season in
   southwestern Madagascar.},

   taxonomic revision, but to review our current understanding of the
   diversity and current and past ranges of lemurs and indicate where there
   is controversy, discrepancy, or lack of knowledge. Our goal therefore is
   to provide a baseline for future taxonomic investigation, as well as a
   clearer focus for research and conservation priorities. We here focus on
   the lemurs of Madagascar and recognize 5 families, 15 genera, and 99
   species and subspecies. We list 39 species of lemurs described since
   2000: 2 dwarf lemurs, Cheirogaleus; 11 mouse lemurs, Microcebus; a giant
   mouse lemur, Mirza; a bamboo lemur, Hapalemur; 17 sportive lemurs,
   Lepilemur; and 7 woolly lemurs, Avahi. Taxonomic revisions have resulted
   in the resurrection of a further 9 taxa. However, the figures do not
   represent the total diversity of Malagasy lemurs because more new
   species are being identified via new field studies and accompanying
   genetic research, and should be described in the near future.},

Abstract = {In recent years several new sportive lemur species (genus Lepilemur)
   have been described. In contrast to other lemur taxa, the genus shows
   comparatively high chromosomal variability, which, in addition to
   molecular data, can be used to infer phylogenetic relationships within
   the genus. By comparing R-banding patterns and fluorescence in-situ
   hybridization data, we detected chromosomal rearrangements that occurred
   during speciation within the genus. The analysis of these data with
   cladistic methods resulted in a dichotomic phylogenetic tree comparable
   to that obtained from mitochondrial sequence data. However, a phase of
   reticulation can not be excluded from the evolution of Lepilemur.
   Although some incongruences were detected, both phylogenies show similar
   patterns concerning relationships of the basal and terminal splits. We
   therefore hypothesize that both, chromosome rearrangements and molecular
   mutations, alone or in combination, contributed to the speciation
   process in sportive lemurs.},

Abstract = {We used data from a 13-year field study of wild ringtailed lemurs to
   analyze the relationship between female rank and reproductive
   parameters. In medium and small groups there were no significant
   differences in birth rate, infant mortality rate, and the number of
   surviving infants between the female rank categories. On the other hand,
   in large sized groups low-ranked females had a smaller number of
   surviving infants than middle-ranked females. This suggests that in
   large sized groups, within-group competition lowered the values of
   reproductive parameters of low-ranked females. On the other hand, high
   and low-ranked females of small sized groups tended to have a smaller
   number of surviving infants than high-ranked females of medium sized
   groups and middle-ranked females of large sized groups. Between-group
   competition should lower the values of their reproductive parameters. In
   sum, these results fit the expectation from Wrangham's (1980) inter
   group feeding competition model.},

Abstract = {I compared the habitat utilization in 3 sympatric species of
   Cheirogaleidae (Microcebus murinus {[}81 g], Cheirogaleus medius {[}183
   g] and Cheirogaleus major {[}362 g]) in a littoral rain forest in
   southeastern Madagascar during 3 rainy seasons. Females of promiscuous
   Microcebus murinus had small home ranges and the males had large
   overlapping home ranges. Home ranges of family groups of monogamous
   Cheirogaleus medius and C. major overlapped extensively. Home ranges of
   all 3 species overlapped completely in the study area but home range
   sizes differed among species and correlate positively with body masses.
   Male Microcebus murinus slept in open vegetation (79\%) and alone
   (71\%), whereas female M. murinus and family group members of
   Cheirogaleus spp. preferred communal sleeping in tree holes. There are
   significant interspecific differences in the choice of sleeping sites:
   smaller lemurs chose smaller trees and used more sleeping sites than
   larger lemurs did. Species also differed significantly in the vertical
   dimension of forest utilization: Cheirogaleus major used the upper part
   of the trees, C. medius used the middle parts, and Microcebus murinus
   used the understory during nocturnal activities. The 3 species differed
   mainly in vertical habitat utilization and showed vertical
   stratification.},

Title = {Feeding over the 24-h cycle: dietary flexibility of cathemeral collared
   lemurs (Eulemur collaris)},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {61},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Animals show specific morphological, physiological and behavioural
   adaptations to diurnal or nocturnal activity. Cathemeral species, i.e.
   animals with activities distributed over the 24-h period, have to
   compromise between these specific adaptations. The driving evolutionary
   forces and the proximate costs and benefits of cathemerality are still
   poorly understood. Our goal was to evaluate the role of predator
   avoidance, food availability and diet quality in shaping cathemeral
   activity of arboreal mammals using a lemur species as an example. For
   this, two groups of collared lemurs, Eulemur collaris, were studied for
   14 months in the littoral forest of southeastern Madagascar. Data on
   feeding behaviour were collected during all-day and all-night follows by
   direct observation. A phenological transect containing 78 plant species
   was established and monitored every 2 weeks to evaluate food
   availability during the study period. Characteristics of food items and
   animal nutritional intake were determined via biochemical analyses. The
   ratio of diurnal to nocturnal feeding was used as response variable in
   the analyses. The effects of abiotic environmental variables were
   removed statistically before the analyses of the biotic variables. We
   found that diurnal feeding lasted longer during the hot-wet season
   (December-February), whereas nocturnal feeding peaked during the hot-dry
   and cool-wet seasons (March-August). Although the lemurs foraged mostly
   in lower forest strata during daylight and used emergent trees
   preferably at night, the variables which measured animal exposure to
   birds of prey failed to predict the variation of the ratio of
   diurnal/nocturnal feeding. Ripe fruit availability and fiber intake are
   the two variables which best predicted the annual variation of the lemur
   diurnality. The data indicate that feeding over the whole 24-h cycle is
   advantageous during lean periods when animals have a fibre-rich,
   low-quality diet.},

Abstract = {The lemurs of Madagascar are known for their extraordinary species
   diversity. The mechanisms that allow the coexistence of these species
   are still poorly known. Here feeding patterns were investigated for
   three small nocturnal lemur species of Cheirogaleidae (Microcebus
   murinus, Cheirogaleus medius and Cheirogaleus major) occurring
   sympatrically in a littoral rainforest in south-east Madagascar. During
   three rainy seasons, the plant species eaten by these three lemurs were
   described in relation to morphological and biochemical characteristics.
   All three species were mainly frugivorous and fed on 68 different plant
   species with small- and medium-sized fruits. A total of 91\% of these
   forage plant species was visited by all three lemur species. Fruits
   larger than 25-30 mm were avoided. Seeds of a total of 51 food plant
   species were swallowed and passed the gut unharmed. Thus, even these
   smaller lemur species play an important role in seed dispersal. There
   were no differences in the morphological and biochemical characteristics
   of fruits eaten between the three species, but the feeding height was
   significantly different between the species. Thus, competition avoidance
   and niche separation are presumably not based on different feeding
   patterns of M. murinus, C. medius and C. major in the littoral
   rainforest, but on different habitat utilization.},

Abstract = {We live in inflationary times. A quarter of a century ago, cigarettes
   were about \$1 a pack in New York City, a bottle of Chateau Beaucastel
   set you back \$15, and there were 36 different species of lemur alive in
   Madagascar(1) (Table 1). Today the equivalent figures are \$7.40, \$95,
   and 83 lemur species(2) (Table 1). The increase in dollar prices has a
   lot to do with the economics of growth, something that obviously cannot
   be sustained indefinitely on a finite planet. Is the recent inflation in
   lemur taxonomy any more secure? The question is all the more worth
   asking because this is no isolated phenomenon: Madagascar's primates
   have not been alone in multiplying. The same burgeoning of species names
   has occurred throughout the order Primates(3,4) and beyond,(5) provoking
   both concern and energetic debate.(6-9) Interestingly, this debate has
   largely unfolded among ecologists, conservationists, and other
   ``consumers{''} of taxonomy; many ``producers{''} seem to be content to
   generate new taxonomies with a remarkable lack of introspection, as if
   they were no more than passive consequences of more lofty concerns. And
   because the same causes underlie taxonomic inflation in Madagascar as
   elsewhere, this extraordinary island once again presents us with a
   microcosm of the larger world.},

Abstract = {The lemurs of Madagascar represent a spectacular example of adaptive
   radiation among primates. Given the special setting under which they
   evolved (i.e. long isolation, geographical location, geological relief),
   they provide excellent models for study in many realms, and at different
   levels and scales, including diversity. At the same time, they occur in
   a `hottest hot spot' region for biodiversity conservation. Although
   there is no single definition of biodiversity, the most commonly used
   units to measure biodiversity are species - species richness, species
   abundance and, for conservation purposes in particular, species
   endemism. However, what a species actually is or how, precisely, it
   should be defined are unresolved issues. Many species concepts have been
   proposed and several have been used in primatology in recent years.
   Nowadays, one of the more common approaches to measuring diversity, and
   eventually inferring species status, is to look at genetic diversity as
   reflected by mitochondrial DNA differences. Not enough attention has
   been paid, however, to the different levels at which genetic differences
   may occur. Lemurs provide instructive examples to highlight the
   questions involved in species recognition and definition. Using lemurs
   as examples, I will highlight the strengths and limitations of some
   analytical tools, including phylogeography and cladistic biogeography
   and, I will, in particular, emphasize the questions arising at the
   interface of scientific and conservation perceptions, both of which
   influence decisions in the field of biodiversity preservation. Copyright

Abstract = {I investigated how transect type (trails vs. cut transects) and
   seasonality influenced density estimates for 5 lemur taxa (Avahi
   laniger, Cheirogaleus major, Eulemur rubriventer, Hapalemur griseus
   griseus, and Microcebus rufus) in the Vohibola III Classified Forest in
   SE Madagascar. I surveyed tree height and diameter and lemur populations
   from June 1 to December 28, 2004 along 2 1250-m trails local people used
   and 2 1250-m transects cut parallel to the trails in primary rain
   forest. Despite dendrometric variations within and between trails and
   transects, only density estimates of Hapalemur griseus griseus differed
   significantly by transect type. The spatial variation may be a result of
   removal by local people of giant bamboo, which is the main food for
   Hapalemur griseus griseus, along trails. Conversely, seasonality
   influenced density estimates for Cheirogaleus major, Eulemur
   rubriventer, Hapalemur griseus griseus, and Microcebus rufus. The
   temporal variations may be related to seasonal torpor for Cheirogaleus
   major and increased detection probabilities during periods of fruit
   exploitation for Eulemur rubriventer, Microcebus rufus, and Hapalemur
   griseus griseus. Transect type and seasonality did not affect density
   estimates for Avahi laniger, which may be related to the highly
   folivorous and low-energy diet of the nocturnal lemur. Researchers
   surveying lemurs along line transects should be aware that transect
   selection may influence density estimates for Hapalemur griseus griseus
   and that seasonality may influence density estimates for Cheirogaleus
   major, Eulemur rubriventer, Hapalemur griseus griseus, and Microcebus
   rufus.},

Abstract = {Because ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) are a female-dominant,
   female-philopatric species in which the females provide the majority of
   parental care and troop defense, resource defense is a possible function
   of female lemur scent marking. To test this hypothesis, I conducted
   three studies. First, I presented captive, individually housed females
   with a series of samples of female scent, each from a different female,
   to determine whether they would respond to those samples and
   discriminate between them. Second, I reanalyzed data from a focal animal
   study of four females in two adjacent troops in Berenty Reserve,
   Madagascar, to determine female marking rates before, during, and after
   the mating season, and to clarify the relationship among positions of
   feeding, intertroop defense, and scent marking. The third study was
   based on ad libitum observations of the sniffing and marking behavior of
   a troop in Berenty Reserve during a year when they traveled far out of
   their home range. The females in study I investigated female scent
   samples but provided no evidence that they discriminated between them.
   In study 2 the wild females marked throughout the study and did not
   limit their marking to the mating season. They deposited significantly
   more of their marks in a zone of confrontation with adjacent troops,
   where they also did the majority of their feeding, and they increased
   their rate of marking during agonistic intertroop confrontations. The
   females determined the positions of their scent marks and deposited the
   first mark in the majority of counter-marking sequences. When the
   females traveled out of their defended range in study 3, they
   significantly decreased their rate of marking and increased their rate
   of sniffing spots but not marking them. All evidence gathered so far
   supports the hypothesis that one function of female ring-tailed lemur
   scent marking is to provide intergroup information that is then used to
   reinforce the border of the defended resource.},

Pages = {434-445},
Abstract = {Lemuroid phylogeny is a source of lively debate among primatologists.
   Reconstructions based on morphological, physiological, behavioural and
   molecular data have yielded a diverse array of tree topologies with few
   nodes in common. In the last decade, molecular phylogenetic studies have
   grown in popularity, and a wide range of sequences has been brought to
   bear on the problem, but consensus has remained elusive. We present an
   analysis based on a composite molecular data set of approx. 6,400 bp
   assembled from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
   database, including both mitochondrial and nuclear genes, and diverse
   analytical methods. Our analysis consolidates some of the nodes that
   were insecure in previous reconstructions, but is still equivocal on the
   placement of some taxa. We conducted a similar analysis of a composite
   data set of approx. 3,600 bp to investigate the controversial
   relationships within the family Lemuridae. Here our analysis was more
   successful; only the position of Eulemur coronatus remained uncertain.

Abstract = {An orphaned infant ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) was attacked
   persistently by immigrant males and disappeared with severe wounds at
   Berenty Reserve, Madagascar. Prior to the attacks., two troop members
   disappeared. On 20 November 1998, the only resident male in Troop C2B
   disappeared suddenly. After the disappearance, nine males from three
   neighboring troops approached, but only six males continued to shadow
   the troop. Of the females, the one lactating female attacked the males
   the most frequently. On 21 January 1999, the lactating female
   disappeared and her infant was orphaned. Subsequently, five attacks on
   the infant by immigrant males were observed for five consecutive days
   from January 23 to 27. The aggression was persistent and specifically
   targeted the infant, suggesting that the attacks were purposeful
   aggression, rather than redirected or accidental aggression. The primary
   attacker was the most dominant of the immigrant males, and mated with
   females in the next mating season.},

Abstract = {Kappeler excluded the presence of reconciliation in a free-ranging group
   of Lemur catta, but a recent study on the same group indicated
   reconciliation, though with a very long PC duration. We collected data
   on 2 captive groups of ring-tailed lemurs at the Pistoia Zoo (Italy) in
   order to shed light on conflict resolution in the species. We
   investigated the influence of seasonality and of a targeted aggression
   episode on the occurrence of reconciliation. We collected 164 PC-MC
   pairs for the A group and 141 for the B group. We performed all analyses
   at the dyadic level via randomization procedures. Despite the targeting
   episode, we found no difference in the levels of aggression between the
   2 groups. In contrast, just before the onset of the targeting episode, B
   showed significantly lower rates of affinitive behaviors versus A.
   Reconciliation occurred in A, whereas it was absent in B. Therefore, we
   suggest that in B, with the decrease of baseline affinitive interactions
   associated with the beginning of the targeting episode, the function of
   postconflict reunions probably stopped working. On the whole, we found
   that contrasting results were probably related to different seasonal and
   social conditions (A: breeding/pregnancy season, characterized by higher
   tolerance rates; B: birth season, characterized by lower tolerance
   rates). Accordingly, reconciliation should be monitored throughout the
   different seasonal phases.},

Abstract = {Cooperation in animal social groups may be limited by the threat of
   ``free riding,{''} the potential for individuals to reap the benefits of
   other individual's actions without paying their share of the costs. Here
   we investigate the factors that influence individual contributions to
   group-level benefits by studying individual participation in territorial
   defense among female ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta). To control for
   potentially confounding factors, particularly group size, we studied two
   semi-free-ranging groups at the Duke University Primate Center. First,
   we used a combination of experimental and observational methods to
   investigate the costs and benefits of territorial defense for individual
   lemurs. We found three indications of costs: physical contact occurred
   during inter-group encounters, participation in territorial defense was
   negatively correlated with ambient temperature, and rates of
   self-directed behaviors increased during encounters. Benefits were more
   difficult to quantify, but observational and experimental tests
   suggested that individuals shared the gains of territorial defense by
   foraging in defended territories. Thus, during experiments in which one
   of the groups was prevented from defending its territory, the
   free-ranging group made more frequent incursions into the other group's
   territory. Second, we examined variation in participation in territorial
   defense. Individuals varied significantly in their rates of aggression
   and genital marking during inter-group encounters. The extensive
   variation documented among individuals was partially accounted for by
   dominance rank, kinship and patterns of parental care. However, we found
   no evidence to suggest that participation was enforced through
   punishment (policing) or exchange of benefits involving grooming. In
   conclusion, this study provides further insights into cooperative
   behavior in mammalian social groups by revealing how the costs and
   benefits of territoriality influence patterns of individual
   participation in the context of shared (collective) goods.},

Abstract = {Monomorphic lemurs of Madagascar allow us to investigate whether there
   are behavioural mechanisms that compensate for sex-specific differences
   in the costs of maintenance and reproduction in arboreal primates. Food
   selection of the pair-living Lepilemur ruficaudatus was studied in
   relation to food chemistry, and travel distances were measured as
   possible indications of differential investment in ranging activities
   (possibly related to the defence of territories and/or mating
   opportunities). Fourteen females and 14 males were radio-tracked for a
   total of 365 half-nights (from dusk to midnight or from midnight to
   dawn) at different times of the year (birth, lactation and weaning,
   pre-mating, post-mating). When based on monthly means, the two sexes did
   not differ in nightly travel distances. Food selection of females and
   males did not differ in relation to the chemical composition of leaves,

Abstract = {Although prosimians are greatly olfaction-oriented, little is known
   about the specifics of how they use scent to communicate. In this
   preliminary study we attempted to delineate intra- and interspecific
   differences among the anogenital gland secretions of two lemur species
   (Lemur catta and Propithecus verreauxi coquereli) using gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results indicate that the
   two species are discernible through scent. Furthermore, we were able to
   identify reproductive status using this technique. The anogenital
   secretions of the different sexes in L. catta, though perhaps not P. v.
   coquereli, are chemically distinguishable. Given this information, it
   appears that at least some lemur species can use scent marks to
   determine species, sex, and reproductive status. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {There is a well-documented relationship between development and other
   life-history parameters among anthropoid primates. Smaller-bodied
   anthropoids tend to mature more rapidly than do larger-bodied species.
   Among anthropoids of similar body sizes, folivorous species tend to grow
   and mature more quickly than do frugivorous species, thus attaining
   adult body size at an earlier age. This pattern conforms to the
   expectations of Janson and van Schaik's ``ecological risk aversion
   hypothesis,{''} which predicts that rates of growth and maturation
   should vary in inverse relation to the intensity of intraspecific
   feeding competition. According to the ecological risk aversion
   hypothesis (RAH), species experiencing high intraspecific feeding
   competition will grow and mature slowly to reduce the risk of mortality
   due to food shortages. Species experiencing low levels of intraspecific
   feeding competition will shorten the juvenile period to reduce the
   overall duration of this high-risk portion of the life cycle. This paper
   focuses on development and maturation in lemurs. We show that folivorous
   lemurs (such as indriids) grow and mature more slowly than like-sized
   frugivorous lemurs (e.g., most lemurids), but tend to exhibit faster
   dental development. Their dental developmental schedules are accelerated
   on an absolute scale, relative to craniofacial growth, and relative to
   particular life-history landmarks, such as weaning. Dental development
   has a strong phylogenetic component: even those lemurids that consume
   substantial amounts of foliage have slower dental development than those
   indriids that consume substantial amounts of fruit. Implications of
   these results for the RAH are discussed, and an explanation for this
   hypothesis' failure to predict lemur growth schedules is offered. We
   propose that the differing developmental schedules of folivorous and
   frugivorous lemurs may reflect different solutions to the ecological
   problem of environmental instability: some rely on a strategy of low
   maternal input and slow returns, while others rely on a strategy of high
   maternal input and fast returns. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Safe sleeping sites may be a limited resource crucial for survival. In
   order to investigate their potential significance for social
   organization in nocturnal primates, we analyzed the spatial distribution
   of daily sleeping sites, their characteristics, their usage, and
   sleeping group compositions in the nocturnal Milne Edwards' sportive
   lemur during a 6-month field study in the dry deciduous forest of
   northwestern Madagascar. Sexes did not differ either in body size or in
   body mass. Sleeping sites were used almost exclusively by adult
   male-female pairs. Individuals showed a high sleeping-site fidelity
   limited to 2-3 different sleeping sites in close vicinity during the
   whole study period. Most females showed a higher fidelity to one
   distinct sleeping site than their male partners. Sleeping groups
   consisted of one adult male and one adult female and remained stable in
   composition over the whole study period. Exclusive pair-specific usage
   of sleeping sites suggests sleeping site related territoriality of
   male-female pairs, perhaps influenced by inter- and intrasexual resource
   competition. Results give first insights into the distribution patterns
   and social organization of this species. They imply dispersed monogamy
   for the Milne Edwards' sportive lemur, with sleeping sites as a
   potentially restricted and defendable resource. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {Iron storage disease (ISD) in lemurs has been reported since as early as
   the 1960s, and in the 1980s was demonstrated to be a consistent finding
   in postmortem investigations of captive lemurs. Since then this disease
   has consistently been diagnosed at the point of necropsy. In the current
   study we describe a preclinical screening procedure, as well as the
   quantified preventive effects of dietary intervention upon iron
   absorption. Twenty-three individual lemurs of four species were
   initially tested with the transferrin saturation test (\%TS); 21 of
   these animals were on conventional zoo diets, and two were fed a
   specific diabetic diet. Initially, 20 of 21 lemurs on conventional zoo
   diets were demonstrated to have \%TS levels above the normal range for
   humans; 17 of these lemurs were in the category (for humans) of
   excessive iron absorption. A dietary change aimed at reducing dietary
   iron and vitamin C levels and increasing the levels of iron-chelating
   tannins and/or phytates was instigated. After the animals were retested,
   a matched-pair comparison of \%TS values before and after the diet
   change revealed significantly (P = 0.038, n = 7) lower \%TS values after
   the diet change. All species averages were in the human hyperabsorption
   range on conventional zoo diets (n = 21). No species averages were in
   that range after the dietary change (n = 18). The results indicate that
   further investigations into the use of \%TS testing in lemur husbandry,
   and specific preventive dietary measures, should be conducted. (C) 2003

Abstract = {Male displacement of copulatory (sperm) plugs from female vaginas
   provides further evidence for sperm competition in ring-tailed lemurs
   (Lemur catta), a gregarious prosimian species with a multimale,
   multifemale mating system. During two mating seasons, I studied two
   groups of free-ranging ring-tailed lemurs on St. Catherines Island, GA,
   USA. I observed 22 mating pairs in which males achieved penile
   intromission. Copulatory plug displacement by males occurred in 9 cases.
   Plugs were displaced during copulation by male penes upon withdrawl
   following deep vaginal thrusting. In every case of copulatory plug
   displacement, the male displacing a plug mated to ejaculation with the
   estrous female. In a mating system in which females typically mate with
   more than one male during estrous, often in succession, copulatory plug
   displacement may function to disrupt or preclude other males' successful
   insemination of estrous females. The effects of sperm plug displacement
   on paternity in Lemur catta are unknown, as no study had heretofore
   documented copulatory plug displacement in this species. The first-male
   mating advantage suggested for Lemur catta should be re-evaluated where
   mating order is known, and copulatory plug displacement during mating,
   or lack thereof, is identified. Because there is a tendency for
   first-mating males to mate-guard for longer periods of time in Lemur
   catta, the latency period between the first mate's ejaculation and that
   of subsequent mates may be an important determinant of male
   fertilization success.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the role of direct olfactory investigation in relation to

   and lasted > 1,500 h. Males were olfactorily more active than females
   except for skin licking, which also appeared to be associated with
   affiliative behaviors. Both sexes had peak frequency of direct olfactory
   monitoring during the reproductive season; contrarily, skin licking
   showed apparently random fluctuations. There is a significant positive
   correlation between rank and sniffing genitals performed by females on
   other females and a significant negative correlation between rank and
   sniffing genitals received: high-ranking females are mostly actors,
   while low-ranking females are mostly receivers. The continuous follow-up

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine effects of seasonal and social
   factors on male androgen excretion in a seasonally breeding primate
   living in multi-male-multi-female groups. By combining detailed
   behavioural observations (>2,500 h) on 3 groups of redfronted lemurs
   living in Kirindy Forest/Madagascar with non-invasive hormone analysis
   of >800 faecal samples collected concomitantly from the same animals, we
   tested predictions on: (1) the effect of social status on immunoreactive
   testosterone (iT) excretion; (2) seasonal variation of iT across
   reproductive periods; and (3) the relationship between aggression and iT
   excretion. The study lasted 14 months, covering two mating and one birth
   season. The results revealed that males fall into two distinct social
   classes, with one dominant male and several subordinate males in each
   group. In contrast to our prediction, the behavioural differences
   between these two classes were not reflected by differences in androgen
   levels, making physiological suppression of testicular function an
   unlikely mechanism of male reproductive competition. As expected for a
   seasonally breeding animal, iT values were elevated during the mating
   season. Androgen levels tracked the increase in the rate of reproductive
   aggression during the mating season as predicted by the challenge
   hypothesis. An increase in aggression due to spontaneous social
   instability outside the mating season, however, was not linked to a
   parallel rise of iT. Furthermore, the highest iT levels were obtained
   during the birth season, which may be part of a male strategy to remain
   aggressive during this period of high infanticide risk. These findings
   suggest that redfronted lemurs do not respond with increases in
   androgens to short-term challenges and that high androgen levels instead
   correlate with longer-lasting and predictable situations, such as the
   mating and birth seasons.},

Abstract = {In this study we use molar microwear analyses to examine the trophic
   distinctions among various taxa of Malagasy subfossil lemurs. High
   resolution casts of the teeth of Megaladapis, Archaeolemur,
   Palaeopropithecus, Babakotia, and Hadropithecus were examined under a
   scanning electron microscope. Megaladapis was undoubtedly a browsing
   folivore, but there are significant differences between species of this
   genus. However, dietary specialists appear to be the exception; for
   example, Palaeopropithecus and Babakotia probably supplemented their
   leaf-eating with substantial amounts of seed-predation, much like modern
   indrids. Hadropithecus was decidedly not like the modem gelada baboon,
   but probably did feed on hard objects. Evidence from microwear and
   coprolites suggests that Archaeolemur probably had an eclectic diet that
   differed regionally and perhaps seasonally. Substantial trophic
   diversity within Madgascar's primate community was diminished by the
   late Quaternary extinctions of the large-bodied species (>9 kg). (C)

Abstract = {The family Lemuridae includes four genera: Eulemur, Hapalemur, Lemur,
   Varecia. Taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships between L. catta,
   Eulemur and Hapalemur, and of Varecia to these other continue to be
   hotly debated. Nodal relationships among the five Eulemur species also
   remain contentious. A mitochondrial DNA sequence dataset from the ND3,
   ND4L, ND4 genes and five tRNAs (Gly, Arg, His, Ser, Leu) was generated
   to try to clarify phylogenetic relationships within the Lemuridae.
   Samples (n=39) from all ten lemurid species were collected and analysed.
   Three Daubentonia madagascariensis were included as outgroup taxa. The
   -2400bp sequences were analysed using maximum parsimony,
   neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods. The results support
   monophyly of Eulemur, a basal divergence of Varecia, and a sister-group
   relationship for Lemur/Hapalemur. Based on tree topology, bootstrap
   values, and pairwise distance comparisons, we conclude that Varecia and
   Eulemur both represent distinct genera separate from L. catta. H.
   griseus and H. aureus form a clade with strong support, but the sequence
   data do not permit robust resolution of the trichotomy involving H.
   simus, H. aureus/H. griseus and L. catta. Within Eulemur there is strong
   support for a clade containing E. fulvus, E. mongoz and E. rubriventer.
   However, analyses failed to clearly resolve relationships among those
   three species or with the more distantly related E. coronatus and E.
   macaco. Our sequencing data support the current subspecific status of
   E.m. macaco and E.m. flavifrons, and that of V.v. variegata and V.v.
   rubra. However, tree topology and relatively large genetic distances
   among individual V.v. variegata indicate that there may be more
   phylogenetic structure within this taxon than is indicated by current
   taxonomy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Studies of primate diets usually focus on differences that distinguish
   species or populations. However, variation in diet can occur at a more
   local level of groups within a population, especially in a
   non-homogeneous habitat. I compared dietary variation in food
   composition and toughness across groups of 2 lemur species in Beza
   Mahafaly special reserve, Madagascar. Beza Mahafaly contains an 80-ha
   reserve (Parcel 1) that, while small, hosts a dense population of Lemur
   catta (ring-tailed lemurs) and Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi
   (sifakas). Microhabitats in the eastern vs. western sides of the parcel
   are structurally and floristically distinct. Sifakas in this parcel have
   small, discrete home ranges and are morphological folivores. For these
   reasons, I expected that the 6 groups studied would eat a different menu
   of food plants but with similar toughness values. Ring-tailed lemurs
   have comparatively large, overlapping home ranges, and I expected that
   the 5 study groups would eat similar foods. Despite living in different
   microhabitats across the parcel, sifakas exhibit high dietary uniformity
   both in dietary plant species composition and the toughness of the
   foods. Food selection in sifakas operates on two distinct levels. Sifaka
   groups share many key food species that appear independent of local
   abundances, but the ranking of the foods within each group appears
   related to availability. Ring-tailed lemur groups are more heterogeneous
   in the composition of their diets relative to sifakas, though the time
   spent feeding on individual foods reveals a marked preference for the
   fruits of Tamarindus indica by all groups. Food toughness is consistent
   across the parcel with the exception of the most western group.
   Ring-tailed lemurs are highly specific feeders, but indiscriminate
   nibblers. Sifakas are targeted, balanced feeders. There does not appear
   to be a consistent microhabitat effect operating across species.
   Differences within sifaka and ring-tailed lemur populations in food
   composition and toughness, however, correspond to an east-west
   microhabitat gradient. Measures of dietary flexibility must take into
   account not only the plant species consumed and the different parts
   eaten but also their associated food properties and proportion of time
   spent feeding on them.},

Abstract = {Scent-marking and olfactory communication are used extensively by
   prosimians and can provide spatial and temporal records of group
   movement and behavior: We compare rates of male scent-marking in
   relation to reproductive seasons, male dominance rank, and habitat use
   in two related prosimians: Lemur catta and Eulemur fulvus rufus. We
   collected scent-marking data on adult male Lemur catta at Beza-Mahafaly
   Reserve (dry forest), and on Eulemur fulvus rufus at Ranomafana National
   Park (rain forest), Madagascar: In Lemur, rates of overall scent-marking
   differed significantly by reproductive season, with higher rates
   occurring in mating and lactation/migration periods, whereas in Eulemur,
   reproductive season did not appear to affect scent-marking rates.
   Dominance rank of male Lemur catta did not affect rates of
   scent-marking. Among male Eulemur fulvus, dominance relations were not
   apparent; however, 2 of the 5 focal males scent-marked somewhat more
   frequently during the mating season and also experienced greater mating
   success In Lemur catta, higher rates of scent-marking in the mating
   season may relate to indirect reproductive competition during a period
   of high aggression, while such mating competition was not as marked in
   Eulemur fulvus. Furthermore, higher rates of marking in resident male
   Lemur catta during male migration may correlate with vigilance toward
   immigrating males Greater overall scent-marking rates in ring-tailed
   lemurs may relate to extensive intergroup home range overlap and no area
   of exclusive use, whereas the red-fronted lemur groups tended to forage
   in areas of their home range where little-to-no intergroup overlap
   occurred.},

Volume = {23},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We censused Lemur catta within a 1 km(2) study area at Berenty Reserve,
   Madagascar, during the September-October birth season for 19 years
   between 1963 and 2000, a total of 290 troop counts (266 with age and
   sex). The non-infant population was 155 in 1972-5, fell to 105 in 1985,
   and rose to a maximum of 282 in 1997, while troops increased from 12 in
   1972-1985 up to 25 in 1998-2000. Local density varies between habitat
   types from 1 per ha to ca. 6 per ha. Troops fission at ca. 15-25
   individuals, or 6-10 females. Adult sex ratio has no apparent
   correlation with fissions, birth rate or survival. Birth rate falls
   steeply with number of adult females, from 80-100\% in 2-female troops
   to about 50\% in 8-10 female troops. The penalty for large troop size is
   greater in the dense, rich areas, but nonetheless troops there are also
   larger. One-year-survival does not vary with troop size, and is lower in
   the sparse, dry zone. Troop size is too large for optimal birth rate,
   but fissioning to much lower size might make troops too small for
   optimal adult survival, given the intense intertroop competition. This
   reflects Sibley's (1983) conjecture that troop sizes may not reach
   stable optima. Rainfall per lemur-year (beginning Oct 1) varied from 265
   to 894 mm. Drought followed by rain can eliminate >90\% of a cohort,
   especially in the dryest zone. Possibly, this results from fruit failure
   in years following drought. It is unknown whether food supplementation
   of some Berenty troops is dangerous for the forest, or helpful for an
   isolated and vulnerable ring-tailed lemur population.},

Abstract = {Among the best known of recently extinct Malagasy lemurs is
   Archaeolemur, which is represented by many hundreds of specimens. The
   phylogenetic affinities of this taxon are unclear, especially in light
   of recent preliminary analysis of ancient DNA which does not support its
   previously accepted close relationship with the living Indridae. We
   examined the nearly complete skeletons of two adults and one juvenile
   and other less complete specimens to reconstruct aspects of the ontogeny
   of Archaeolemur. To compare the development of Archaeolemur to that of
   living strepsirrhines we collected data on Propithecus verreauxi,
   Eulemur fulvus, and Lemur catta. Additionally, because Archaeolemur
   exhibits some morphological convergences with distantly related
   papionins, we tested for convergence in the developmental patterns of
   Archaeolemur and Macaw fascicularis. Data include the status of tooth
   eruption, craniofacial sutural closure, and post-cranial epiphyseal
   fusion, as well as linear measurements. We used discriminant function
   analysis and other tools to explore ontogenetic similarities and
   differences.
   The adaptive and phylogenetic significance of ontogenetic information is
   discussed. Our analysis shows that Archaeolemur displays a clear
   strepsirrhine pattern of development with only minor macaque
   convergences. Among the Strepsirrhini, Archaeolemur is slightly more
   similar developmentally to E. fulvus and L. catta than to P. verreauxi.
   Some of the distinctive features of the ontogeny of Archaeolemur may be
   related to diet, while others bear apparent testimony to a relatively
   rapid absolute pace of growth and development. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {The forebrain and pituitary sites of synthesis of growth hormone
   secretagogue-receptor mRNA were identified in four adult lemurs
   (Microcebus murinus) by in situ hybridisation performed with a
   radiolabeled cRNA probe transcribed from human Growth Hormone
   Secretagogue-Receptor cDNA. The cRNA sense and antisense probes were
   hybridised to cryostat sections containing structures extending from the
   rostral hypothalamus to its caudal Limit as defined by the mammillary
   bodies. The pituitary gland and areas adjacent to the hypothalamus were
   also analyzed. For comparative purposes, sections from five adult rats
   containing these structures were hybridised with the same probes. The
   results point to a widespread distribution of Growth Hormone
   Secretagogue-Receptor mRNA in the hypothalamus, hippocampal formation,
   and cerebellar cortex of both lemurs and rats. As in the rat, specific
   hybridisation was particularly dense in the arcuate nucleus. Significant
   species differences were observed in the periventricular nucleus, the
   ventromedial nucleus, the lateral hypothalamic area, and the pituitary
   gland. In contrast to the rat, the lemur exhibited marked labelling in
   the infundibular nucleus, the periventricular nucleus and the pars

Title = {Origins, diversity and relationships of lemurs},

Abstract = {I review new evidence on origins and adaptive radiation of Malagasy
   lemurs, a remarkably diverse group containing 13\% of living primate
   species. The number of recognized lemur species has increased
   significantly, partly due to research revealing specific subdivisions
   within known populations but mainly because of discovery of new
   populations through fieldwork. Some species feared to be extinct have
   also been rediscovered. Specific numbers have increased particularly in
   small-bodied, cryptic genera for which continued research will surely
   reveal evert more species.
   Adaptative radiation of lemurs has been essentially confined to
   Madagascar. The high density of lemur species on that island, associated
   with very small geographical ranges, has major implications both for
   their evolutionary divergence and for conservation. Reconstructions of
   phylogenetic relationships among primates have been considerably
   enhanced by DNA sequence data. Sufficient data are now, available from
   both nuclear and mitochondrial sequences to examine relationships among
   and within the major groups of living primates. Most studies have
   confirmed that lemurs constitute a monophyletic sister-group of the
   lorisiform clade and all exclude a specific relationship between
   cheirogaleids and lorisiforms repeatedly inferred from morphological
   evidence. However, some analyses indicate that the aye-aye may have
   branched away before the divergence between other lemurs and
   lorisiforms. DNA sequence analyses have also yielded a broad consensus
   for relationships between Eulemur, Hapalemur, Lemur and Varecia: Varecia
   branched away first, while Lemur is more closely related to Hapalemur
   than to Eulemur.
   As debate about phylogenetic relationships among lemurs and other
   primates seems to have been settled in favor of lemur monophyly
   (possibly excluding the aye-aye), only a single invasion of Madagascar
   is required; but it must still be explained how ancestral lemurs could
   have migrated there at an appropriate time. Separation between
   Madagascar and Africa was apparently complete by about 120 Ma, too far
   in the past for direct overland migration. A recent hypothesis suggested
   that uplifted land in the Mozambique Channel assisted colonization of
   Madagascar 26-45 Ma, seemingly agreeing with an estimated date of about
   40 Ma for divergence of lemurs from other primates. However, mounting
   evidence suggests that divergence occurred significantly earlier.
   Because the earliest known fossil representatives of several modern
   orders of placental mammals (including primates) are tinted no earlier
   than the early Tertiary, it is widely, accepted that their divergence
   took place after the Cretaceous/Tertiary mass extinction. Yet the known
   fossil record can only yield minimum divergence times; if sampling is
   poor and/or biased there may be a considerable discrepancy between
   minimum and actual dates. There is, for example, virtually no known
   fossil record for lemurs in Madagascar and the earliest known
   representatives are subfossil lemurs, so in this case a direct reading
   of the fossil record would indicate that the lemurs first originated
   just a few thousand years ago! Examination of underestimation of times
   of origin because of poor sampling in the fossil record has confirmed
   previous suggestions that primates originated considerably earlier than
   generally believed Several recent phylogenetic reconstructions based on
   DNA sequence data and using calibration dates derived from groups other
   than primates provide independent support for this inference. Overall,
   it now seems that primates originated at around 90 Ma rather than the 55
   Ma indicated by direct reading of die known fossil record. Hence,
   colonization of Madagascar by lemurs would have taken place at about 80
   Ma, double the date usually accepted and should be interpreted in terms
   of contemporary continental relationships.},

Abstract = {The western woolly, lemur is distributed through central western,
   northwestern and possibly, northern Madagascar and is traditionally
   viewed as a monotypic species (Avahi occidentalis) or as a subspecies of
   A. laniger. We present new data on body weights of Avahi which, together
   with previously available body, weights, provide additional evidence for
   recognizing eastern and western woolly lemurs as two distinct species.
   We then reexamine the distributions of, and chromatic variation within
   and between, populations of western woolly, lemurs. A comparative study
   of wild subjects and museum skins reveals that several geographically
   discrete morphs exist in western Avahi, which is clearly, polytypic.
   Marked differences between populations in fur coloration suggest that
   greater than or equal to3 distinct taxa should be recognized. The
   populations differ considerably in their habitat structure, In addition,
   field observations suggest clear differences in population density
   between greater than or equal to2 of the populations, We describe and
   name one new species.},

Abstract = {Birth sex ratios were examined for ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta) at
   the Duke University Primate Center. This population provides a long-term
   database of births under a variety of demographic and management
   conditions, including two semi-freeranging groups between which males
   transfer freely and females defend stable territorial boundaries. We
   examined three hypotheses usually considered in studies of primate sex
   ratio bias. The Trivers-Willard hypothesis predicts that dominant
   females produce males, local resource competition at the population
   level (LRC-population) predicts that the dispersing sex (males) will be
   overproduced in dense populations, and local resource competition among
   individuals (LRC-individual) predicts that dominant females overproduce
   the philopatric sex (females). We also examined a fourth hypothesis,
   local resource enhancement (LRE), which is usually subsumed under
   LRC-individual in studies of primate sex ratio evolution. LRE predicts
   that under certain conditions, females will produce the sex that
   provides later cooperative benefits, such as alliance support for
   within- or between-group competition. Our data provide support for LRE:
   females overproduce daughters given prospects of new group formation,
   either through group fission or threatened expulsion of young mothers.
   Behavioral data from Duke and also wild populations show that daughters
   serve mothers as important allies in this context and LRE effects also
   have been documented in other mammals that experience similar group
   histories. Nonsignificant trends in the data supported the
   LRC-population hypothesis, and we suggest that LRC interacts with LRE to
   explain offspring sex ratios in ringtailed lemurs.},

Abstract = {Through a 16-mo mark-recapture trap study, I examined aspects of spatial
   distribution and population composition in the brown mouse lemur,
   Microcebus rufus, a 42 g nocturnal strepsirhine. The study took place in
   the rainforest of Ranomafana National Park in southeastern Madagascar.
   Sherman live traps were set monthly for a variable number of nights in a
   quasi-grid 50 m apart. Captured individuals were marked for future
   identification and released at site of capture. More males than females
   were captured overall (102 versus 72) and at 83\% of trap sites. Trap
   sex ratio fluctuated significantly over the course of the study. It was
   particularly male-biased between June and August (3.9:1), when more
   previously uncaptured males than females (14 versus 6) entered the trap
   population. Some of these males remained in the trap population.
   Although the average number of individuals captured was not
   significantly different between the first four and last four months of
   the study, the composition of the population changed. The female
   population, however, changed less: 28.9\% of all females captured in the
   first four months of the study were recaptured in the last four months,
   compared to 9.7\% of males. It is suggested that the pattern of
   appearance of new individuals and disappearance of others, both
   predominantly male, may indicate migratory activity. Furthermore, an
   average of eight individuals were captured at each trap site (similar to
   70\% of traps captured more than five), suggesting a high degree of
   spatial overlap. The average number of male and female individuals
   captured in each trap (5.5 males versus 2.5 females), the average number
   of trap sites at which males and females were captured (3.6 versus 2.4),
   and the average number of captures for males and females (9.8 versus
   5.7) all differed significantly between the sexes. Am. J. Primatol.

Abstract = {The challenge hypothesis (J. C. Wingfield, R. E. Hegner, B. G. Ball, and
   A. M. Duffy, 1990, Am. Nat 136, 829-846) proposes that in birds,
   reptiles, and fish, ``the frequency or intensity of reproductive
   aggression as an effect of T{[}estosterone] is strongest in situations
   of social instability, such as during the formation of dominance
   relationships, the establishment of territorial boundaries, or
   challenges by a conspecific male for a territory or access to mates{''}
   (p. 833). To determine the extension of this hypothesis to mammalian
   species, we tested predictions of the hypothesis in a nonpaternal,
   seasonal breeding, prosimian primate (ring-tailed lemurs, Lemur catta).
   Semi-free-ranging males were studied during periods of social stability
   (premating period) and instability (mating period). The annual mating
   season consists of several days during which males fight for access to
   promiscuous group females as each individually becomes sexually
   receptive for 1 day. Male rates of aggression were compared to fecal
   testosterone levels within premating and mating periods. In the
   premating period male rate of aggression was not significantly
   correlated with testosterone level. By contrast, during the mating
   season testosterone and aggression levels were positively and
   significantly correlated. However, on days just preceding estrus, male
   rate of aggression was not significantly correlated with testosterone,
   but on days of estrus, when aggressive challenges peaked sharply,
   testosterone and aggression were highly positively correlated. These
   results suggest that the challenge hypothesis applies to mammals as well
   as to birds, reptiles, and fish. In addition, elevations in testosterone
   were tightly circumscribed around days of estrus, suggesting a
   com-promise between costs and benefits of elevated testosterone levels.

   signal at some pericentromeric regions involving constitutive
   heterochromatin as well. The pericentromeric region of chromosome 1 of
   Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) was labeled with a
   large and intense signal. The range of the signal considerably exceeded
   the area of DAPI positive heterochromatin. On the other hand, in the
   five lemurs, a large signal was detected also in the short arm of
   acrocentric chromosomes. Acquisition of the large block of the telomeric
   sequence into the acrocentric short arm might be interpretable in terms
   of the tandem growth of the heterochromatic short arm and the reciprocal
   translocation between heterochromatic short arms involving the telomeric
   sequence. Subsequently, it was postulated that meta- or submetacentric
   chromosomes possessing the telomeric sequence at the pericentromeric
   region could be formed by centric fusion between such acrocentric
   chromosomes.},

Abstract = {Lemur catta troops in a 1-km(2) study area at Berenty Reserve have
   maintained fidelity to core areas since Budnitz and Dainis' study of
   1972-1973, and for two troops possibly since 1963. Population in 1 km(2)
   fluctuated from 155 to 105 to 282 individuals (excluding infants), and
   the number of troops increased from 12 to 21. Most troops retain the
   same core areas from year to year (170 observed troop-years). Ten troops
   derived from known fissions. have settled in parts of their parent troop
   range or an adjacent neighbor's range. Five more troops may derive from
   similar matrilocal fissioning, inferred from behavior and ranging
   patterns. One has remained unchanged. Five have unknown parentage, in
   the ranges of four previously censused troops. Once a fissioned troop
   completely replaced another; one troop permanently extended its range,
   three times females joined a different troop, once a female remained
   nomadic for two years without stable home range. No fissioned troop has
   been seen to leapfrog others: to settle discontiuously from its parent.
   Intertroop antagonism may reflect benefits of long-term core area

   included decreased obesity and increased agility as well as foraging for
   appropriate novel plants. Ranging, daily behavior cycles, and
   vocalizations developed more slowly over 1-3 years, but eventually the
   behavior resembled that of wild groups. Group composition and social
   structure changed through conflict to resemble wild and captive troops
   in social organization, including the emergence of matrilineal dominance
   and male emigration. Since behavior eventually resembled that seen in
   the wild, some resilience of species-typical wild behavior in captivity

Journal = {SYMBIOSIS},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {123-141},
Abstract = {Karyological analyses of lemur taxa reveal Robertsonian chromosome
   rearrangements and pericentric inversions. Karyotypic fission
   (kinetochore reproduction) theory potentially explains lemur karyotype
   evolution. Application of the theory suggests that modem lemurs are
   derived from an ancestral primate with a diploid number of 20. All
   extant karyotypes of lepilemurid, lemurid, daubentoniid, indrid, and
   cheirogaleid are most parsimoniously explained as the product of four
   karyotypic fissions, two primary and two secondary, followed by
   pericentric inversions. The first fissioning event generated the
   karyotypic diversity that later became fixed in the ancestral stocks of
   the Daubentoniidae, Indridae, and a common lemurid-cheirogaleid stock.
   The ancestral stock of the Lepilemuridae was not affected by this event,
   but did experience a later independent fissioning of the ancestral
   2N=20, generating modern diploid numbers ranging from 20-38. A secondary
   fissioning event isolated the Lemuridae and Cheirogaleidae from one
   another. A separate secondary fissioning explains indrid karyotypes.
   Kinetochore research supplies mechanisms for karyotypic fissioning
   followed by normal segregation of fission-generated acrocentric
   chromosomes. This analysis is consistent with the theory of the origins
   of eukaryotic cells, including the mitotic and meiotic motility system,
   from fusion of archaebacterial and eubacterial (spirochete) lineages. Ad
   hoc theories of Robertsonian fusions require approximately 100
   independent events to generate the karyotypes of lemurs. Fission theory,
   consistent with the tendency of former endosymbionts to reproduce at
   different rates from their host cells, requires only 2-4 independent
   events.},

   studies, mainly from two study sites in Madagascar, Berenty and Beta

   captivity at the Duke University Primate Center in Durham, North
   Carolina, have greatly expanded our knowledge of the ecology and
   behavior of this species (Table 1, Box 1). Thirty-five years of research
   on this species at these various sites indicates that Lemur catta is
   proving to be every bit as complex in its behavior as are many

Journal = {BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {134},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {225-274},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Two semifree-ranging groups of ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta) and two
   co-ranging groups of redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus) were
   studied across a two-year period to characterise and contrast the adult
   agonistic behaviour these primates exhibit within groups. Temporal
   analyses of behavioural data distinguished agonistic from non-agonistic
   behaviour and aggressive from submissive behaviour. The ringtailed
   lemurs employed a diverse repertoire of behavioural elements to
   communicate agonistic intent. More than 50\% of these elements were
   signals and nearly 50\% of signals were submissive. The agonistic
   repertoire of the redfronted lemurs, by contrast, was relatively
   unelaborated: less than 40\% of agonistic behaviour in this species
   comprised signals and less than 20\% of signals were submissive. These
   structural differences underlay marked species differences in agonistic
   interaction and relationship. All pairs of ringtailed lemurs maintained
   dominance relations resembling those seen in many anthropoid primates:
   subordinates consistently signalled submissively to dominant partners,
   often in the absence of aggression. Dominance relations among members of
   each sex were seasonally unstable and not always transitive
   (hierarchical) during periods of stability, however. Redfronted lemurs,
   by contrast, did not maintain dominance relations, failing to respond
   agonistically to most aggression received (52\% of interactions) and
   responding with aggression on many other occasions (12\%). Even applying
   relaxed criteria, few adult redfronted dyads (14\%) showed consistent
   asymmetries in agonistic relations and several never exhibited any
   asymmetry. Lacking dominance, E. f. rufus relied heavily on alternate
   behavioural mechanisms to moderate social conflict as frequent and
   intense as that seen in study groups of ringtailed lemurs. These
   included a great inclination not to respond agonistically to aggression,
   a distinctive behavioural proposal to limit or terminate dyadic conflict
   (Look away), post-conflict reconciliation, and relatively frequent
   third-party aggression. The existence of such divergent systems of
   agonistic behaviour in partially sympatric, closely related and
   generally similar prosimian primates offers important opportunities for
   comparative study of the ecology, development, and evolution of
   mammalian social systems. Future research may reveal ecophysiological
   factors that promote the use of dominance behaviour among like-sexed
   ringtailed lemurs and show how the relative absence of dominance relates
   to other major elements of redfronted lemur biology, including `special
   relationships' of variable duration between adult males and females.},

Year = {1997},
Volume = {72},
Number = {1},
Pages = {111-151},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The aim of this review is to summarize newly available information on
   lemur social systems, to contrast it with the social organization of
   other primates and to relate it to existing models of primate social
   evolution. Because of their evolutionary history, the primates of
   Madagascar constitute a natural experiment in social evolution. During
   millions of years of isolation, they converged with other primates only
   in the most fundamental way in the evolution of solitary, pair-living
   and group-living species, but deviate in several respects within these
   basic categories of social organization. Solitary lemurs remain poorly
   studied, but their social organization appears to be broadly similar to
   that of other solitary primates, even though the unexpected lack. of
   sexual dimorphism may indicate that similar types of social organization
   can give rise to different mating systems. The determinants of a
   solitary lifestyle remain elusive. Pair-living lemurs show striking
   convergences with other monogamous primates in several behavioural
   traits, but also deviate in that the majority of species are at least
   partly nocturnal and do not exhibit direct paternal care of dependent
   young. Group-living lemurs have not evolved single-male groups,
   male-bonded and multi-level societies, and polyandrous groups may also
   be lacking. Female philopatry is common, but female bonds are generally
   weakly developed and eviction of females from natal groups is not
   unusual. Group-living lemurs also differ from anthropoids in that their
   groups have even adult sex ratios, smaller average size and may split up
   on a seasonal basis. Feeding competition, predation risk and
   reproductive competition can not fully explain these unusual aspects of
   lemur social organization. It has therefore been suggested that the
   social consequences of the risk of infanticide and of recent changes in
   activity may be ultimately responsible for these idiosyncracies of
   group-living lemurs, an explanation largely supported by the available
   evidence. Thus, social factors and fundamental life-history traits, in
   addition to ecological factors, contribute importantly to variation in
   social systems among lemurs, and possibly other primates. However,
   neither the diversity of lemur social systems, nor the evolutionary
   forces and mechanisms operating in these and other primates are yet
   fully understood.},

Abstract = {Most lemurs yet studied in detail exhibit some mode of adult female
   social dominance over males. The known exception, a brown lemur
   subspecies known as rufous or redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus),
   forms multimale-multifemale social groups within which unambiguous
   dominance relations are not observed among adults. Resting groups of
   redfronted lemurs consistently include huddling adult male-female pairs
   whose males selectively scentmark and rub their heads in the scentmarks
   of their female huddling partners. Quantitative observations confirmed
   that some of these male-female pairs maintain special relationships
   satisfying all criteria originally developed in research on
   cercopithecine monkeys. Observations before, during, and after mating
   season, intergroup encounters, male transfers, and changes in
   male-female affiliations illuminated developmental and functional
   aspects of male-female partnerships. Each adult female in two
   semi-free-ranging study groups shared high rates of association,
   grooming, and agonistic support and low rates of agonistic interaction
   with one unrelated or distantly related adult male partner. Such
   affinity characterized small proportions of adult male-female
   relationships. Several males directed not only support but also
   aggression toward adult females with whom they sought to affiliate. All
   bonded males sought to copulate with their partners, and some appeared
   to ignore estrus in nonpartners. All females accepted copulation
   attempts from partners and some seemed to prefer their partners as
   mates. Partial synchronization of brief estrus periods together with
   concealed ovulation appeared to minimize chances for polygynous mating.
   Results support the view that the male-female pair is the fundamental
   social unit of E. fulvus and suggest that female partnership with
   individual males obviates dominance behavior, including female
   dominance, in this lemurid primate. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {We describe responses of seven mothers and other troop members to dead
   and dying infants in several troops of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)
   at the Berenty Reserve, Madagascar. In contrast to mothers in simian
   species, ring-tailed lemur mothers rarely carried their dying, immobile
   or dead infants. However, they sniffed, licked, and touched them even
   after they had died. While the dying infants were still peeping, their
   mothers remained near them, and 15 to 76 min after the infants ceased to
   peep, they were left by their mothers. Six of the seven mothers returned
   to their dead infants several times within the first few hours after
   they had left them. All seven mothers gave repeated calls, such as
   `'mew'' and `'pyaa,'' when they were separated from either their dead
   infants or other troop members or both. Thus, each mother exhibited some
   form of maternal behavior toward her dead infant for hours after its
   death. These results indicate that there may not be a great gap in terms
   of maternal affection between simian and prosimian mothers. We also
   discuss visuospatial memory ability in ring-tailed lemurs and the causes
   of the infants' deaths.},

Abstract = {The Alaotran gentle lemur Hapalemur griseus alaotrensis is an endangered
   primate from Madagascar. As part of a conservation strategy for this
   taxon a captive breeding programme has been established at the Jersey
   Wildlife Preservation Trust (JWPT). A, important part of successfully
   maintaining and breeding these lemurs in captivity is an understanding
   of their nutritional needs. Restricted to a unique primate habitat of
   reed and papyrus beds around Lac Alaotra in Madagascar, this folivorous
   lemur is maintained at JWPT on a mixture of fresh produce and forage.
   This paper describes research to measure dietary intake and composition
   of selected forage items in order to provide information on actual
   nutrient intake. Two 7-day feeding trials measured daily intake in April
   and June of 1995, representing periods of poor and good quality forage
   availability respectively. Data were collected for two pairs of animals,
   although just one pair was studied in both trials. Representative
   samples of the forage items were collected and analysed in duplicate for
   crude protein, neutral detergent and acid detergent fibre and the
   results comparing the composition of various plant parts are presented.
   The pair of lemurs tested in both trials appeared to obtain sufficient
   protein from the diet according to published requirements for primates
   (>16.7\% on dry matter basis). They seemed to achieve this by
   selectivity in their choice of forage fraction. Chemical analysis of the
   plant parts selected (shoot tips, new leaves and new leaf bases) showed
   them all to have a relatively high elude protein content and to be low
   in acid detergent fibre. Apical bamboo shoot tips Here found to contain
   339g/kg crude protein and shoot bases of Phragmites reed 373g/kg, but
   amino acid determination found the sample of bamboo shoot tips to be
   limiting in lysine.},

Abstract = {A-Troop of Lemur catta at Berenty Reserve, Madagascar, divided in
   July-August 1992. We observed the daughter troops-A1 and A2-between Aug.
   15 and Nov. 15. The subordinate female subgroup of A-Troop (A2) had been
   harassed for at least 3 years previously. After fission, it suffered
   high conflict and energy demands, wounding, and socially induced infant
   mortality. Costs of fission may be a pressure for remaining in large
   troops. In September, A2 ranged widely, was chased by all neighbor
   troops, but then it challenged the previously dominant subgroup, Al, and
   by late October occupied a portion of the previous A-Troop range in
   which if was consistently successful in confrontations. A2's acquisition
   of range may relate to its high affiliation and low conflict between
   females of the subgroup. Unlike previously reported fission in L. catta
   there was no male involvement in defense, and the females that lost
   infants became more aggressive. This may be interpreted as female
   competition for resource control.},

Abstract = {Surface areas of humeral and femoral heads scale largely as a function
   of body size. However, differences in the relative sizes of these
   articular surfaces are correlated with differential joint mobility and
   force transmission through fore- and hindlimbs. They can therefore
   assist interpretation of the positional behavior of extinct species. In
   this paper, we document variation in ratios of humeral head surface area
   to femoral head surface area among extant primates and other mammals. We
   then examine a group of extinct primates: the subfossil lemurs of
   Madagascar. Many Malagasy lemurs, including some giant extinct species
   with very long forelimbs and short hindlimbs, have relatively small
   humeral heads and large femoral heads. We explore the adaptive
   implications of this pattern. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Pages = {1-43},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships among the extant lemurid prosimians were
   assessed cladistically using stereotyped vocal, olfactory, and visual
   communication characters. Among our results are 3 findings of particular
   importance. First, our data are consistent with those from several
   recent studies of highly repeated DNA fragments in supporting a close
   phyletic affinity between Lemur catta and the genus Hapalemur. Moreover,
   our results indicate that L. catta is nested within the Hapalemur ur
   clade as the sister taxon to Hapalemur griseus/Hapalemur aureus. We
   interpret character states shared between Hapalemur simus and L. catta
   as primitive retentions by L. catta. Second, our findings agree with the
   DNA data in proposing a sister group relationship for Eulemur coronatus
   and Eulemur rubriventer. Third, our results question the validity of
   assigning Varecia variegata to the Lemuridae. For the characters we
   examined, Varecia more resembled indrids than lemurids, and the position
   of Varecia could be swapped with any of our outgroups (Indri,
   Propithecus, Daubentonia) without affecting tree topology. Previous
   workers sometimes have linked Varecia with various lemurids on grounds
   of ambiguously defined characters or on incorrect data gleaned from the
   literature. In those studies, the placement of Varecia in the Lemuridae
   usually has depended more on the minimization of character state
   conflicts (i.e. parsimony), than on demonstrable synapomorphies. In
   addition, data from DNA research have failed to demonstrate any pattern
   that links Varecia with Lemur; Hapalemur, or Eulemur. Results of the
   present study suggest that shared Varecia-indrid character states may be
   symplesiomorphic retentions in the Indridae, and that Varecia could be
   phyletically more primitive than either the indrids or lemurids.},

   monitored for a 40-month period. Sixty-four percent of the males (43 of
   67) migrated or were missing within this period and all nine censused
   groups were affected by migration. Males migrate from their natal group
   and then may migrate again after reaching full adult body weight.
   Full-sized adult males migrate at a rate of 0. 28 per year or once every
   3.5 years and may change groups a number of times during their life.
   Migrations occurred within a 6-month period, ending just after the
   mating season. However, there is no direct connection between mating
   success and male migration. Females mate with transferring males, with
   group males, and with visitors from adjacent groups. The age-related
   pattern of male migration and the occurrence of extragroup mating in
   Lemur catta is similar to that described for several species of
   macaques.},

Title = {On the modulation and maintenance of hibernation in captive dwarf lemurs},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 11},
Abstract = {In nature, photoperiod signals environmental seasonality and is a strong
   selective ``zeitgeber{''} that synchronizes biological rhythms. For
   animals facing seasonal environmental challenges and energetic
   bottlenecks, daily torpor and hibernation are two metabolic strategies
   that can save energy. In the wild, the dwarf lemurs of Madagascar are
   obligate hibernators, hibernating between 3 and 7 months a year. In
   captivity, however, dwarf lemurs generally express torpor for periods
   far shorter than the hibernation season in Madagascar. We investigated
   whether fat-tailed dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus medius) housed at the Duke
   Lemur Center (DLC) could hibernate, by subjecting 8 individuals to
   husbandry conditions more in accord with those in Madagascar, including
   alternating photoperiods, low ambient temperatures, and food
   restriction. All dwarf lemurs displayed daily and multiday torpor bouts,
   including bouts lasting -11 days. Ambient temperature was the greatest
   predictor of torpor bout duration, and food ingestion and night length
   also played a role. Unlike their wild counterparts, who rarely leave
   their hibernacula and do not feed during hibernation, DLC dwarf lemurs
   sporadically moved and ate. While demonstrating that captive dwarf
   lemurs are physiologically capable of hibernation, we argue that
   facilitating their hibernation serves both husbandry and research goals:
   first, it enables lemurs to express the biphasic phenotypes (fattening
   and fat depletion) that are characteristic of their wild conspecifics;
   second, by ``renaturalizing{''} dwarf lemurs in captivity, they will
   emerge a better model for understanding both metabolic extremes in
   primates generally and metabolic disorders in humans specifically.},

Title = {Environmental and anthropogenic influences on movement and foraging in a
   critically endangered lemur species, Propithecus tattersalli:
   implications for habitat conservation planning},
Journal = {MOVEMENT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Background Wildlife conservation often focuses on establishing protected
   areas. However, these conservation zones are frequently established
   without adequate knowledge of the movement patterns of the species they
   are designed to protect. Understanding movement and foraging patterns of
   species in dynamic and diverse habitats can allow managers to develop
   more effective conservation plans. Threatened lemurs in Madagascar are
   an example where management plans and protected areas are typically
   created to encompass large, extant forests rather than consider the
   overall resource needs of the target species. Methods To gain an
   understanding of golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli)
   movement patterns, including space use and habitat selection across
   their range of inhabited forest types, we combined behavior data with
   Dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models and Resource Selection
   Functions. We also examined the influence of abiotic, biotic, and
   anthropogenic factors on home range size, movement rates, and foraging
   patterns. Results We found that home range size and movement rates
   differed between seasons, with increased core area size and movement in
   the rainy season. Forest type also played a role in foraging behavior
   with sifaka groups in the humid forest avoiding roads in both seasons,
   groups in the dry deciduous forest avoiding road networks in the rainy
   season, and groups in the moderate evergreen forest displaying no
   selection or avoidance of road networks while foraging. Conclusion Our
   study illustrates the importance of studying primate groups across
   seasons and forest types, as developing conservation plans from a single
   snapshot can give an inaccurate assessment of their natural behavior and
   resources needs of the species. More specifically, by understanding how
   forest type influences golden-crowned sifaka movement and foraging
   behavior, conservation management plans can be made to the individual
   forest types inhabited (dry deciduous, moderate evergreen, humid,
   littoral, etc.), rather than the region as a whole.},

Title = {Toward Passive Acoustic Monitoring of Lemurs: Using an Affordable
   Open-Source System to Monitor Phaner Vocal Activity and Density},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Abstract = {Developing new cost-effective methods for monitoring the distribution
   and abundance of species is essential for conservation biology. Passive
   acoustic monitoring (PAM) has long been used in marine mammals and has
   recently been postulated to be a promising method to improve monitoring
   of terrestrial wildlife as well. Because Madagascar's lemurs are among
   the globally most threatened taxa, this study was designed to assess the
   applicability of an affordable and open-source PAM device to estimate
   the density of pale fork-marked lemurs (Phaner pallescens). Using 12
   playback experiments and one fixed transect of four automated acoustic
   recorders during one night of the dry season in Kirindy Forest, we
   experimentally estimated the detection space for Phaner and other lemur
   vocalizations. Furthermore, we manually annotated more than 10,000
   vocalizations of Phaner from a single location and used bout rates from
   previous studies to estimate density within the detection space. To
   truncate detections beyond 150 m, we applied a sound pressure level
   (SPL) threshold filtering out vocalizations below SPL 50 (dB re 20 mu
   Pa). During the dry season, vocalizations of Phaner can be detected with
   confidence beyond 150 m by a human listener. Within our fixed truncated
   detection area corresponding to an area of 0.07 km(2) (detection radius
   of 150 m), we estimated 10.5 bouts per hour corresponding to a density
   of Phaner of 38.6 individuals/km(2). Our density estimates are in line
   with previous estimates based on individually marked animals conducted
   in the same area. Our findings suggest that PAM also could be combined
   with distance sampling methods to estimate densities. We conclude that
   PAM is a promising method to improve the monitoring and conservation of
   Phaner and many other vocally active primates.},

Title = {Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 silencing inhibits the proliferation of gastric

Abstract = {Previous studies on the mechanism of proliferation and cell cycle
   progression of gastric cancer cells have shown promising perspectives
   for the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer. The aim of the
   present study was to investigate the role of lemur tyrosine kinase 2
   (LMTK2) in gastric cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression,
   as well as in tumor-bearing nude mouse models. The expression levels of
   LMTK2 were determined in gastric cancer cell lines. In addition, the
   effects of LMTK2 silencing or overexpression on cell proliferation were
   measured using Cell Counting Kit-8, BrdU and colony formation assays.
   Cell cycle progression was analyzed using flow cytometry and western
   blotting. The expression levels of proteins associated with the
   beta-catenin pathway were assessed using western blot analysis. A
   tumor-bearing nude mouse model was established by injecting gastric
   cancer cells, and the effect of LMTK2 knockdown or overexpression on
   tumor growth was examined. The expression levels of LMTK2 were found to
   be upregulated in all gastric cancer cell lines. Moreover, LMTK2
   knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and cell cycle
   progression. LMTK2 knockdown also inhibited the activation of GSK-3
   beta/beta-catenin signaling, as evidenced by reduced GSK-3 beta
   phosphorylation and nuclear beta-catenin levels. LMTK2 knockdown also
   suppressed tumor growth, whereas overexpression accelerated this
   process. In conclusion, LMTK2 silencing can inhibit the proliferation of
   gastric cancer cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo by regulating
   GSK-3 beta phosphorylation and beta-catenin nuclear translocation.},

Title = {Linking variability in early life growth of Sardinella lemuru to changes
   in habitat conditions in Zamboanga upwelling system, Sulu Sea, the
   Philippines},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {682},

Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {The year-class success of small pelagic fish is strongly modulated by
   the growth and survival of early life stages. Determining how
   environments control growth is critical to understanding processes
   influencing annual production. We provide the first measurements of
   larval growth in Sardinella lemuru, the most abundant and exploited
   tropical sardine species in the Philippines. Growth rates of larvae were
   examined across a 2 yr period (2011-2012 and 2012-2013 spawning seasons)
   using otolith microstructure analysis. Transition to the juvenile stage
   occurred within 25 to 37 d. Mean growth rate of the 2011 year-class was
   significantly lower than the 2012 year-class despite significant
   intra-annual (batch) differences in growth trajectories. In both years,
   larvae that hatched and developed in the cooler yet prey-rich period in
   the middle of the spawning season (January) displayed the fastest
   growth, while those spawned early (September-October 2012) and late
   (February-March 2012) showed the slowest growth rates. Peak hatch-months
   (December 2011 and October 2012) were just prior to periods of
   upwelling, with mean prey concentrations of 0.24 +/- 0.13 mg m(-3) at
   26.35 +/- 2.56 degrees C sea surface temperature (SST) and 0.23 +/- 0.15
   mg m(-3) at 26.26 +/- 1.79 degrees C, respectively. The SST during
   upwelling was 0.01 to 1.23 degrees C cooler accompanied by a 0.07 to
   0.45 mg m(-3) increase in prey concentration. In both years, differences
   in growth rate were strongly linked to oceanographic conditions.
   Moderate winds during a `neutral' El Nino-Southern Oscillation year
   resulted in upwelling conditions favoring faster overall growth in
   larvae which was associated with stronger recruitment. In contrast,
   slower growth and weaker recruitment were associated with weak upwelling
   conditions in the 2011-2012 La Nina year. While temperature may be
   important, larval growth rates appear to be driven more by prey
   abundance.},

Title = {Honest signaling in mouse lemur vocalizations?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Abstract = {Animal vocalizations may provide information about a sender's condition
   or motivational state and, hence, mediate social interactions. In this
   study, we examined whether vocalizations of gray mouse lemurs
   (Microcebus murinus) emitted in aggressive contexts (grunts, tsaks)
   co-vary with physical condition, which would underly and indicate honest
   signaling. We recorded calls from captive individuals that were
   subjected to a caloric restricted (CR) or ad libitum (AL) diet, assuming
   that individuals on an ad libitum dietary regime were in better
   condition. We analyzed 828 grunts produced by seven CR and nine AL
   individuals and 270 tsaks by eight CR and five AL individuals. Grunts
   consisted of two separate elements, with the 1(st) element having more
   energy in higher frequencies than the 2(nd) element. Body mass
   correlated negatively with acoustic features of grunts, and heavier
   individuals produced lower-frequency grunts. Acoustic features of grunts
   did not differ between sexes. Acoustic features of tsaks were predicted
   by neither body mass nor sex. However, tsaks produced by AL individuals
   were noisier than those of CR individuals. Hence, manipulation of body
   condition via dietary regimes affected acoustic features of calls given
   during aggression in different ways: acoustic features of grunts varied
   according to the rule of acoustic allometry, and can be considered as
   honest signals. Acoustic features of tsaks, however, varied according to
   motivational structural rules. Longitudinal studies are now indicated to
   examine whether intra-individual changes in body mass are also reflected
   in the acoustic structure of calls, allowing callers to signal more
   flexible variation in condition.},

Abstract = {Aging is not homogeneous in humans and the determinants leading to
   differences between subjects are not fully understood. Impaired glucose
   homeostasis is a major risk factor for cognitive decline in middle-aged
   humans, pointing at the existence of early markers of unhealthy aging.
   The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), a small lemuriform Malagasy
   primate, shows relatively slow aging with decreased psychomotor
   capacities at middle-age (around 5-year old). In some cases (similar to
   10\%), it spontaneously leads to pathological aging. In this case, some
   age-related deficits, such as severe cognitive decline, brain atrophy,
   amyloidosis, and glucoregulatory imbalance are congruent with what is
   observed in humans. In the present review, we inventory the changes
   occurring in psychomotor and cognitive functions during healthy and
   pathological aging in mouse lemur. It includes a summary of the
   cerebral, metabolic, and cellular alterations that occur during aging
   and their relation to cognitive decline. As nutrition is one of the
   major nonpharmacological antiaging strategies with major potential
   effects on cognitive performances, we also discuss its role in brain
   functions and cognitive decline in this species. We show that the
   overall approach of aging studies in the gray mouse lemur offers
   promising ways of investigation for understanding, prevention, and
   treatments of pathological aging in humans.},

Title = {Assessing Allostatic Load in Ring-Tailed Lemurs (Lemur catta)},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Simple Summary: Our ability to measure and understand chronic stress in
   animals is limited by animals' inability to communicate to us their
   perception of stressors. Researchers have developed tools to measure
   stress in animals, but these tools have many limitations. A novel
   measurement of chronic stress using several biomarkers has been studied
   in humans and great apes, but no research has assessed this tool in
   other primates, including lemurs. Our aim was to determine the
   relationship between allostatic load index (ALI), a measurement of
   chronic stress, and individual, social, medical and husbandry factors
   that may impact stress in lemurs housed under human care. Smaller group
   sizes, a higher percentage of time spent indoors, and more frequent
   group changes were associated with a higher ALI, indicating that these
   factors may be associated with chronic stress and potential deleterious
   health effects. This research presents support for ALI as a tool to help
   us better understand and mitigate stress in animals under our care.
   Responses to stress are unavoidable, adaptive mechanisms in humans and
   non-human animals. However, in humans, chronic stress has been linked to
   poor health outcomes and early mortality. Allostatic load, the
   physiologic dysregulation that occurs when an organism is exposed to
   chronic stressors, has been used to assess stress in humans; less work
   has been done using non-human primates. Our aim was to determine the
   relationship between allostatic load in ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)
   under human care and potentially stressful individual, social, medical
   and husbandry factors, as well a sex and age. An allostatic load index
   (ALI) was calculated for 38 lemurs using six biomarkers measured in
   serum (albumin, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, DNA damage,
   glucose and prostaglandin E2). Potentially stressful factors were
   recorded over the lifetime of each lemur using medical and husbandry
   records. Animals with a higher percentage of time spent indoors, those
   kept in smaller average group sizes, and those with fewer minor group
   composition changes had, or tended to have, higher ALI. There was no
   relationship between ALI and sex or age. Some social and husbandry
   factors were associated with allostatic load in lemurs, indicating that
   this index may be a useful tool in assessing and determining factors
   contributing to stress of lemurs and other animals under human care.},

Title = {The Tongue in Three Species of Lemurs: Flower and Nectar Feeding
   Adaptations},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Simple Summary: Comparative studies of primate gustatory anatomy are
   sparse and incomplete. Here, we compare both the macro and micro anatomy
   of the tongue in three lemurid species. We included two non-destructive
   nectar-feeders, Varecia variegata and Eulemur macaco, and one
   destructive flower feeder, Lemur catta. To study the tongue's structure,
   we used direct observation together with different microscopy
   techniques, ranging from optical microscopy to electronic microscopy. We
   found differences in the size, shape, and distribution of the tongue's
   papillae. Most notably, there are large distinct papillae present at the
   tip of the tongue in nectar-feeding species. In addition, histological
   images of the ventro-apical portion of the tongue show that tongue
   houses an encapsulated structure in all species studied. The
   non-destructive flower-feeding species share similar tongue and
   sublingua anatomy, suggesting that the observed features may be adaptive
   for flower feeding. These features were not observed in the destructive
   flower feeder, Lemur catta.The mobility of the primate tongue allows for
   the manipulation of food, but, in addition, houses both general sensory
   afferents and special sensory end organs. Taste buds can be found across
   the tongue, but the ones found within the fungiform papillae on the
   anterior two thirds of the tongue are the first gustatory structures to
   come into contact with food, and are critical in making food ingestion
   decisions. Comparative studies of both the macro and micro anatomy in
   primates are sparse and incomplete, yet there is evidence that gustatory
   adaptation exists in several primate taxa. One is the distally feathered
   tongues observed in non-destructive nectar feeders, such as Eulemur
   rubriventer. We compare both the macro and micro anatomy of three
   lemurid species who died of natural causes in captivity. We included the
   following two non-destructive nectar feeders: Varecia variegata and
   Eulemur macaco, and the following destructive flower feeder: Lemur
   catta. Strepsirrhines and tarsiers are unique among primates, because
   they possess a sublingua, which is an anatomical structure that is
   located below the tongue. We include a microanatomical description of
   both the tongue and sublingua, which were accomplished using
   hematoxylin-eosin and Masson trichrome stains, and scanning electron
   microscopy. We found differences in the size, shape, and distribution of
   fungiform papillae, and differences in the morphology of conical
   papillae surrounding the circumvallate ones in all three species. Most
   notably, large distinct papillae were present at the tip of the tongue
   in nectar-feeding species. In addition, histological images of the
   ventro-apical portion of the tongue displayed that it houses an
   encapsulated structure, but only in Lemur catta case such structure
   presents cartilage inside. The presence of an encapsulated structure,
   coupled with the shared morphological traits associated with the
   sublingua and the tongue tip in Varecia variegata and Eulemur macaco,
   point to possible feeding adaptations that facilitate non-destructive
   flower feeding in these two lemurids.},

Title = {Black-and-White Ruffed Lemur (Varecia variegata) in Captivity: Analysis
   of the Oral Microbiota in a One Health Perspective},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Simple Summary The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria is a
   serious public health problem. Wild animals are known to be sources of
   multidrug-resistant bacteria as well as infectious diseases, some of
   them transmissible to humans. Due to many factors, such as the
   destruction of natural habitats or climate change, contact between wild
   animal species and humans is increasing. Thus, it is particularly
   important that studies be carried out in wildlife species to assess the
   possible existence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this case, the
   chosen species was the black-and-white ruffed lemur belonging to a zoo.
   Through a sample of the oral cavity, it was possible to know that half
   of the bacteria isolated in this group of animals were resistant to, at
   least, one antibiotic and one of them is resistant to an antibiotic for
   exclusive use in a hospital environment. Captive wild mammals can be a
   source of multidrug-resistant bacteria and studies such as this could
   contribute to the development of strategies to prevent the spread of
   this public health program.
   Abstract This study aimed to characterize the susceptibility profile to
   antibiotics and biofilm formation of Gram-negative bacterial isolates
   obtained from the oral cavity of the black-and-white ruffed lemur
   (Varecia variegata). From eight individuals from a zoo located in
   Portugal, samples of the oral microbiota were collected with sterile
   swabs and then placed in closed tubes with a transport medium. Culture
   was carried out for media of Gram-negative bacteria. Twenty-two isolates
   were obtained and subjected to susceptibility tests to twenty-five
   antimicrobial agents belonging to seven different classes. All tested
   isolates demonstrated resistance to, at least, one antibiotic, and it
   was possible to observe multidrug resistance in 11 of the 22 isolates
   (50\%). It should be noted that an isolate showed phenotypic resistance
   to imipenem, an antibiotic for exclusive use in a hospital environment.
   All the isolates showed an increasing ability of biofilm formation over
   time. The obtained results show that wild mammals in captivity could be
   reservoirs and potential sources of multi-resistant pathogens. In view
   of this fact and considering the One Health concept, it will be
   advisable to establish local monitoring programs worldwide that benefit
   and protect human, animal and environmental health.},

   and filled with lightly eosinophilic fibrillar stroma and numerous,
   round basophilic cells. Polymerase chain reaction targeting a portion of

Title = {Lemurs before lemur: depictions of captive lemurs prior to Linnaeus},
Journal = {NOTES AND RECORDS-THE ROYAL SOCIETY JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE},
Abstract = {In 1758, Carl von Linne (Linnaeus) published the tenth edition of
   Systema Naturae, in which he formally described the most unique group of
   primates: lemurs. The story of the early human-mediated dispersal of
   lemurs from Madagascar, prior to their formalized descriptions, is a
   complex one. It touches on the birth of the standardization of modern
   zoology, empire building, and the growth of international trade and
   commerce, with many Fellows of the Royal Society contributing to the
   earliest observations of these animals in captive settings. Through the
   use of historical documents and artwork, we present this history in four
   parts: `Part I: The lemurs that became `lemurs' (1746-1756)', discusses
   the specific lemurs that Linnaeus used to describe the genera in the
   tenth and twelfth editions of Systema Naturae; `Part II: Establishing
   the trade routes (1500-1662)', examines seventeenth century captive
   lemurs and the role of the trade routes of the East India Companies in
   the transportation of lemurs from Madagascar; `Part III: Tracing the
   Bugee (1693-1732)', reviews the lemurs identified by late seventeenth
   and early eighteenth century pre-Linnaean naturalists; and `Part IV: The
   chained lemur (1732-1761)', concludes with eighteenth century lemurs in
   menageries and as luxury goods.},

Title = {Antibiotic Resistance Genes in Lemur Gut and Soil Microbiota Along a
   Gradient of Anthropogenic Disturbance},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {The overuse of man-made antibiotics has facilitated the global
   propagation of antibiotic resistance genes in animals, across natural
   and anthropogenically disturbed environments. Although antibiotic
   treatment is the most well-studied route by which resistance genes can
   develop and spread within host-associated microbiota, resistomes also
   can be acquired or enriched via more indirect routes, such as via
   transmission between hosts or via contact with antibiotic-contaminated
   matter within the environment. Relatively little is known about the
   impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on reservoirs of resistance genes
   in wildlife and their environments. We therefore tested for (a)
   antibiotic resistance genes in primate hosts experiencing different
   severities and types of anthropogenic disturbance (i.e., non-wildlife
   animal presence, human presence, direct human contact, and antibiotic
   treatment), and (b) covariation between host-associated and
   environmental resistomes. We used shotgun metagenomic sequencing of
   ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) gut resistomes and associated soil
   resistomes sampled from up to 10 sites: seven in the wilderness of
   Madagascar and three in captivity in Madagascar or the United States. We
   found that, compared to wild lemurs, captive lemurs harbored greater
   abundances of resistance genes, but not necessarily more diverse
   resistomes. Abundances of resistance genes were positively correlated
   with our assessments of anthropogenic disturbance, a pattern that was
   robust across all ten lemur populations. The composition of lemur
   resistomes was site-specific and the types of resistance genes reflected
   antibiotic usage in the country of origin, such as vancomycin use in
   Madagascar. We found support for multiple routes of ARG enrichment
   (e.g., via human contact, antibiotic treatment, and environmental
   acquisition) that differed across lemur populations, but could result in
   similar degrees of enrichment. Soil resistomes varied across natural
   habitats in Madagascar and, at sites with greater anthropogenic
   disturbance, lemurs and soil resistomes covaried. As one of the
   broadest, single-species investigations of wildlife resistomes to date,
   we show that the transmission and enrichment of antibiotic resistance
   genes varies across environments, thereby adding to the mounting
   evidence that the resistance crisis extends outside of traditional
   clinical settings.},

Abstract = {Production of omega-3 fatty acids from lemuru fish by-products was
   studied by enzymatic hydrolysis using a lipase enzyme in one liter of
   the batch reactor. The hydrolysis temperature of fish oil was set at 45
   to 55. for 0 to 24 h, whereas agitation from 50 to 150 rpm. RSM-Box
   Bhenken was used to study the effect of these parameters on omega-3
   (EPA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and a-linolenic acid (ALA)) content.
   The \% free fatty acid ( FFA), acid index, peroxide index, iodine index,
   and saponification index of lemuru fish oil was 0.925, 2.52, 42.5,
   97.28, and 160.11\%, respectively. GC-MS analysis results showed that
   unsaturated fatty acids content (62.34\%), which are consisted of
   omega-3 (EPA, DHA, and ALA), omega-6 and omega-9, was much higher than
   saturated acids (12.97\%). The experiment data showed that the highest
   EPA (1.221\%) and DHA (0.312\%) content were reached at 50. and 24 h
   with 150 rpm of agitation. However, through the RSM-Box Bhenken analysis
   and 3D surface plot, it was suggested that the optimum condition was
   obtained at 45. and 24 h with 150 rpm of agitation with the content of
   EPA, DHA, and ALA were 1.709, 0.49, and 1.237\%, respectively.},

Title = {The Influence of Seasonal Availability of Young Leaves on Dietary Niche
   Separation in Two Ecologically Similar Folivorous Lemurs},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {92},
Number = {3},
Pages = {139-150},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Traditional socio-ecological models consider that folivorous primates
   experience limited feeding competition due to the low quality, high
   abundance, and even distribution of leaves. Evidence from several
   folivorous species that experience similar constraints to frugivores
   does not support this hypothesis. The sympatric lemur genera Avahi
   (Indriidae) and Lepilemur (Lepilemuridae) are good models to understand
   how food availability constrains folivores since they are both
   nocturnal, folivorous, and have a comparable body mass. Here we
   investigate how two nocturnal folivorous primates, Avahi meridionalis
   and Lepilemur fleuretae, living in the lowland rain forest of
   Tsitongambarika, South-East Madagascar, partition their dietary niche
   and are influenced by seasonality of young leaves. To account for food
   availability, we collected annual phenological data on 769 trees from
   200 species. We also collected behavioural data on 5 individuals per
   lemur species from August 2015 to July 2016 via continuous focal
   sampling. We found the phenological profile to be seasonal with peaks of
   leaf flushing, flowering, and fruiting occurring in the austral summer.
   The two species showed limited dietary overlap (37\% rich period, 6\%
   lean period), and A. meridionalis showed higher feeding time and longer
   daily distances travelled during the rich period. Lepilemur fleuretae
   showed a dietary shift during the lean period, relying more on mature
   leaves (73.3\% during the lean period, 13.5\% during the rich period)
   but maintaining similar activity levels between seasons. The time spent
   feeding on food items by A. meridionalis was positively correlated with
   the nitrogen content and negatively correlated with polyphenols during
   the rich period. We highlighted a clear effect of the seasonality of
   young leaves on the diet, nutritional content, activity patterns, and
   daily distances travelled by two folivorous species, which can be linked
   to nutrient balancing and time-minimising versus energy-maximising
   strategies.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Agriculture is one of the foremost and the minimum salaried employment
   in India. Data mining be able to fetch an explosion in the agriculture
   field by altering the profits scenario through growing the optimum crop
   with crop yield prediction, which is a difficult task because of the
   climatic factors, soil fertility, nutrients and so on. Precise crop
   forecast requires fundamental understanding of the functional
   association between crop and input parameters and to predict the crop
   yield in advance we developed an Adaptive Lemuria algorithm. Our
   proposed model comprises of Deep Belief Network for feature learning and
   pre-training, Decision tree \& K-Means clustering (HDTKM) with Particle
   Swarm Optimization (PSO) for training to attaining global solution and
   Naive bayes clustering with PSO for testing to get optimum result. The
   forecast made by our proposed algorithms will aid the ranchers to choose
   which crop to cultivate to get the extreme yield. The experimentation
   was conducted to verify the performance of our proposed framework in
   python with Anaconda Spyder and outcome attains 98.35 \% of accuracy
   with an error rate of 0.0314, which is relatively higher than the
   existing methodologies.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The members of the Lemur Tyrosine Kinases (LMTK1-3) subfamily constitute
   a group of three membrane-anchored kinases. They are known to influence
   a wide variety of key cellular events, often affecting cell
   proliferation and apoptosis. They have been discovered to be involved in
   cancer, in that they impact various signalling pathways that influence
   cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness. Notably, in the context
   of genome-wide association studies, one member of the LMTK family has
   been identified as a candidate gene which could contribute to the
   development of prostate cancer. In this review, of published literature,
   we present evidence on the role of LMTKs in human prostate cancer and
   model systems, focusing on the complex network of interacting partners
   involved in signalling cascades that are frequently activated in
   prostate cancer malignancy. We speculate that the modulators of LMTK
   enzyme expression and activity would be of high clinical relevance for
   the design of innovative prostate cancer treatment.},

Title = {Insights into the environmental conditions contributing to variability
   in the larval recruitment of the tropical sardine Sardinella lemuru},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {451},

Abstract = {The small pelagic fishery in the southern Philippines is one of the
   largest contributors to fisheries production in the country, and is
   dominated by the Bali sardine Sardinella lemuru. This species is a
   year-round spawner that has its peak spawning period during the
   northeast monsoon (NEM) months of November to February. However, there
   is still limited information on the conditions that affect this species'
   survival during its early life history stages. Here, we attempt to
   discern the importance of temperature, prey density and advection on
   sardine larvae. The larvae were represented as passive particles that
   were released in known spawning grounds to simulate dispersal. The
   conditions the larvae experienced, namely, temperature and estimated
   prey density based on satellite chlorophyll-a values were recorded at
   each time step until the estimated recruitment age of 60 days. The
   temporal and spatial averaged conditions of recruited sardines showed
   that sardines spawned during the NEM months experienced higher
   chlorophyll-a, lower (more optimal) sea surface temperature, albeit
   higher advective loss, than sardines spawned during other months.
   Comparisons between years showed that during higher reported catch
   years, sardine larvae experienced lower temperatures and higher
   retention nearshore. Our results emphasize that sardine stock management
   efforts need to recognize the contribution of the temporally variable
   sardine environment to patterns in sardine recruitment and consequently
   in catches.},

Title = {Lowered sensitivity of bitter taste receptors to beta-glucosides in
   bamboo lemurs: an instance of parallel and adaptive functional decline

Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Bitter taste facilitates the detection of potentially harmful substances
   and is perceived via bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) expressed on the
   tongue and oral cavity in vertebrates. In primates, TAS2R16 specifically
   recognizes beta-glucosides, which are important in cyanogenic plants'
   use of cyanide as a feeding deterrent. In this study, we performed
   cell-based functional assays for investigating the sensitivity of
   TAS2R16 to beta-glucosides in three species of bamboo lemurs (Prolemur
   simus, Hapalemur aureus and H. griseus), which primarily consume
   high-cyanide bamboo. TAS2R16 receptors from bamboo lemurs had lower
   sensitivity to beta-glucosides, including cyanogenic glucosides, than
   that of the closely related ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta). Ancestral
   reconstructions of TAS2R16 for the bamboo-lemur last common ancestor
   (LCA) and that of the Hapalemur LCA showed an intermediate sensitivity
   to beta-glucosides between that of the ring-tailed lemurs and bamboo
   lemurs. Mutagenetic analyses revealed that P. simus and H. griseus had
   separate species-specific substitutions that led to reduced sensitivity.
   These results indicate that low sensitivity to beta-glucosides at the
   cellular level-a potentially adaptive trait for feeding on cyanogenic
   bamboo-evolved independently after the Prolemur-Hapalemur split in each
   species.},

Title = {Mouse Lemurs in an Assemblage of Cheirogaleid Primates in Menabe
   Central, Western Madagascar - Three Reasons to Coexist},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 22},
Abstract = {Ecological communities are structured by interactions between coexisting
   species that mutually influence their distribution and abundance.
   Ecologically similar species are expected to exclude one another from
   suitable habitat, so the coexistence of two mouse lemur species in an
   assemblage of several closely related cheirogaleid primates in the
   central Menabe region of Madagascar requires explanation. We assessed
   the occurrence of Madame Berthe's mouse lemurs (Microcebus berthae) and
   Gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), and of two larger cheirogaleids,
   Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli) and the western
   fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius), by nocturnal line transect
   walks between 2003 and 2007. We explored interspecific interactions for
   four different scenarios with varying resource availability (degraded
   and non-degraded habitat in the wet and dry season), both on the
   regional spatial scale and on a finer local (transect) scale. We tested
   whether the interspecific distribution of mouse lemur individuals
   indicates interspecific competition and whether their regional
   coexistence might be stabilized by interactions with M. coquereli or C.
   medius. We developed the ``Inter-Species Index of Attraction{''} (ISIA)
   to quantify the observed interspecific interactions within transects and
   determined if these were significantly different from a null model
   generated by a combination of randomization and bootstrapping to control
   for intraspecific aggregation. For the two mouse lemurs, interspecific
   spatial exclusion was most pronounced during the resource-poor dry
   season, consistent with the hypothesis of feeding competition.
   Seasonally varying distribution patterns indicated resource tracking in
   a spatio-temporally heterogeneous environment. The interspecific
   distribution of individuals suggested that the larger cheirogaleids
   benefit M. berthae at the expense of the more abundant M. murinus:
   spatial associations of both, M. coquereli and C. medius, with M.
   murinus were negative in most scenarios and across spatial scales, but
   neutral or even positive with M. berthae. Thus, our study revealed that
   coexistence among ecologically similar heterospecifics can rely on
   complex density-mediated interspecific processes varying with habitat
   quality and season. With regard to the stability of animal assemblages,
   this insight has major implications for biodiversity conservation.},

Abstract = {BackgroundAnaplasma are obligate intracellular bacteria and aetiological
   agents of tick-borne diseases of both veterinary and medical interest.
   The genus Anaplasma comprises six species: Anaplasma marginale,
   Anaplasma centrale, Anaplasma ovis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma
   bovis and Anaplasma platys. They can infect humans, carnivores,
   ruminants, rodents, insectivores, birds and reptiles. The aim of this
   study was to present the first clinical case of granulocytic
   anaplasmosis in a captive ring-tailed lemur in Poland.Case presentationA
   4-year-old female lemur presented anorexia, epistaxis and tick
   infestation. The microscopic examination of a blood smear revealed
   morulae in neutrophils. Polymerase chain reaction test and sequencing of
   obtained PCR product confirmed infection by the GU183908 Anaplasma
   phagocytophilum strain. Therapeutic protocol included doxycycline (2.5
   mg/kg p.o., b.i.d.) for 3 weeks and the lemur recovered within 24 h.
   ConclusionsThis is the first report on granulocytic anaplasmosis in a
   ring-tailed lemur in Europe, indicating that A. phagocytophilum
   infection must also be considered in differential diagnosis in this
   animal species, especially in individuals with thrombocytopenia
   associated with Ixodes ricinus parasitism.},

Journal = {FISHES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Understanding the impact of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) on fishery around
   Indonesia is important as the fishery resources are small compared to
   the demand. In this study, we analyzed the effect of positive and
   negative phases of IOD on chlorophyll-a concentration and the catch of
   Sardinella lemuru in the Bali Strait. Data are based on field surveys in
   the Bali Strait during the positive and negative phase of IOD and Sea
   Surface Temperature (SST) and Sea Surface Chlorophyll (SSC) obtained
   from the analysis of satellite images. The results suggest that SSC
   concentration in the strait significantly correlates with the positive
   and negative phase of IOD, possibly through a change of upwelling and
   downwelling there. It is suggested that the change of phytoplankton
   biomass due to positive IOD would result in an increase of Sardinella
   lemuru in the Bali Strait. This research has direct implications as
   important information for the government in planning lemuru fisheries
   management in the Bali Strait based on oceanographic studies and climate

   primates at 11.7 Tesla},
Journal = {NEUROIMAGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {226},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Measures of resting-state functional connectivity allow the description
   of neuronal networks in humans and provide a window on brain function in
   normal and pathological conditions. Characterizing neuronal networks in
   animals is complementary to studies in humans to understand how
   evolution has modelled network architecture. The mouse lemur (Microcebus
   murinus) is one of the smallest and more phylogenetically distant
   primates as compared to humans. Characterizing the functional
   organization of its brain is critical for scientists studying this
   primate as well as to add a link for comparative animal studies. Here,
   we created the first functional atlas of mouse lemur brain and describe
   for the first time its cerebral networks. They were classified as two
   primary cortical networks (somato-motor and visual), two high-level
   cortical networks (fronto-parietal and fronto-temporal) and two limbic
   networks (sensory-limbic and evaluative-limbic). Comparison of mouse
   lemur and human networks revealed similarities between mouse lemur
   high-level cortical networks and human networks as the dorsal
   attentional (DAN), executive control (ECN), and default-mode networks
   (DMN). These networks were however not homologous, possibly reflecting
   differential organization of high-level networks. Finally, cerebral hubs
   were evaluated. They were grouped along an antero-posterior axis in
   lemurs while they were split into parietal and frontal clusters in
   humans.},

Abstract = {A key aspect of a primate's ecology is its food source, the very nature
   of which is spatially and seasonally dependent and may be affected by
   anthropic pressures. One of the most endangered, yet best-studied,
   strepsirrhine primates is the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), a species
   that has experienced significant human-induced habitat loss over many
   decades. To help understand feeding variability across time and space, I
   present a literature review of plant species (and parts) fed on by
   ring-tailed lemurs at nine sites in Madagascar: Ambatotsirongorongo,
   Andringitra Massif, Anja Reserve, Antserananomby, Berenty Reserve, Beza
   Mahafaly Special Reserve, Cap Sainte-Marie, Tsaranoro Valley Forest, and
   Tsimanampetsotsa National Park. I gathered literature using keyword
   searches on Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) and verified
   scientific names using the ``Catalogue of the Plants of Madagascar{''}
   (http://legacy. tropicos.org/Project/Madagascar). From 24 studies, I
   identify 221 genera and 241 species of consumed plants, with 92 genera
   and 70 species consumed at two or more sites. Based on the available
   distribution data, 63\% of species are endemic and 22\% native.
   Sixty-seven plants are known only by Malagasy common names and excluded
   from analyses. When authors identify the plant tissue consumed, 52\% of
   species in the diet are represented by a single tissue type, typically
   leaves (mature and immature) or fruit (ripe or unripe). This review
   highlights the importance of studying multiple populations when creating
   dietary summaries of species and should prove valuable to those
   exploring ecological trends and habitat use by ring-tailed lemurs.},

Abstract = {Background Edge effects can influence species composition and community
   structure as a result of changes in microenvironment and edaphic
   variables. We investigated effects of habitat edges on vegetation
   structure, abundance and body mass of one vulnerable Microcebus species
   in northwestern Madagascar. We trapped mouse lemurs along four 1000-m
   transects (total of 2424 trap nights) that ran perpendicular to the
   forest edge. We installed 16 pairs of 20 m(2) vegetation plots along
   each transect and measured nine vegetation parameters. To determine the
   responses of the vegetation and animals to an increasing distance to the
   edge, we tested the fit of four alternative mathematical functions
   (linear, power, logistic and unimodal) to the data and derived the depth
   of edge influence (DEI) for all parameters. Results Logistic and
   unimodal functions best explained edge responses of vegetation
   parameters, and the logistic function performed best for abundance and
   body mass of M. ravelobensis. The DEI varied between 50 m (no. of
   seedlings, no. of liana, dbh of large trees {[}dbh >= 10 cm]) and 460 m
   (tree height of large trees) for the vegetation parameters, whereas it
   was 340 m for M. ravelobensis abundance and 390 m for body mass,
   corresponding best to the DEI of small tree {[}dbh < 10 cm] density (360
   m). Small trees were significantly taller and the density of seedlings
   was higher in the interior than in the edge habitat. However, there was
   no significant difference in M. ravelobensis abundance and body mass
   between interior and edge habitats, suggesting that M. ravelobensis did
   not show a strong edge response in the study region. Finally, regression
   analyses revealed three negative (species abundance and three vegetation
   parameters) and two positive relationships (body mass and two vegetation
   parameters), suggesting an impact of vegetation structure on M.
   ravelobensis which may be partly independent of edge effects.
   Conclusions A comparison of our results with previous findings reveals
   that edge effects are variable in space in a small nocturnal primate
   from Madagascar. Such an ecological plasticity could be extremely
   relevant for mitigating species responses to habitat loss and
   anthropogenic disturbances.},

Title = {Enter the Matrix: Use of Secondary Matrix by Mouse Lemurs},

Abstract = {Madagascar is home to many threatened and endemic primate species, yet
   this island has seen dramatic declines in lemur habitat due to forest
   loss. This forest loss has resulted in an increasingly fragmented forest
   landscape, with fragments isolated from each other by grasslands (i.e.,
   matrix). The grassland matrix is not entirely homogeneous containing
   matrix elements such as isolated trees and shrubs and linear features
   such as drainage lines. Because most lemurs are predominantly arboreal,
   they may preferentially use matrix elements to facilitate dispersal
   between fragments for access to mates or reduce feeding competition,
   allowing gene flow between fragments of habitat. Therefore, it is
   important to understand to what degree they use the matrix. We
   investigated matrix use in two mouse lemurs, the grey mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus) and the golden-brown mouse lemur (Microcebus
   ravelobensis) in a fragmented landscape in northwest Madagascar. We
   tested the predictions that: (1) lemurs use matrix less often than
   forest fragments, (2) if they use the matrix, then they will
   preferentially use matrix elements compared to grassland, and (3) M.
   murinus will disperse into the matrix further than M. ravelobensis. In
   2011, we visually surveyed line transects in four areas containing
   matrix elements and four adjacent forest fragments during nocturnal
   walks. In 2017, we set up traplines in four areas of the matrix
   containing matrix elements, three areas that were grassland, and six
   traplines in adjacent fragments. We compared the relative abundance of
   mouse lemurs in matrix transects to fragmented forest transects, and the
   relative abundance of captured lemurs in matrix elements, grassland, and
   fragment traplines. We found that encounter rates of mouse lemurs did
   not significantly differ between the matrix and fragmented forest
   transects or traplines. Our sample size was too low to determine if the
   mean distance from the forest was greater for either Microcebus spp. Our
   study highlights that mouse lemurs do use matrix elements and there may
   be interspecific differences in use. Further research is needed to
   confirm species-specific matrix use, why mouse lemurs use matrix, and
   how much matrix elements facilitate movement for each species in
   fragmented landscapes.},

Abstract = {Aggressive behavior of 155 individuals of black-and-white ruffed lemurs
   (Varecia variegatavariegata (Kerr 1792)) and red ruffed lemurs (Varecia
   variegata rubra (Geoffroy 1812)) kept in conditions of domestic and
   foreign zoological parks was studied. The material was collected in the
   summer months in 2008-2018. The animals were kept in pairs and groups of
   up to 14 individuals. The total duration of observations is more than
   5600 h. When analyzing aggressive behavior, we took into account the
   number of individuals in group, the sex and age of animals, close family
   ties, as well as the area and type of enclosure. It is shown that the
   aggressive behavior of ruffed lemurs depends on the age of animals:
   older females are more aggressive than the young ones, whereas males
   more rarely initiate aggression with age. Significant differences in the
   frequency of aggressive interactions in groups with different sex
   composition are revealed. It is found that the frequency of aggressive
   interactions in groups consisting of males and females decreased with an
   increase in the area of enclosure per animal. The aggressive behavior of
   ruffed lemurs does not depend on the number of individuals in group, the
   relatedness of the aggressor and the victim, and the type of enclosure
   (indoor or outdoor). The types of conflict situations depending on the
   reasons and conditions of occurrence of aggressive interaction as well
   as the structure of aggressive interactions in different categories of
   conflict pairs are described.},

Title = {Affiliative Contact Calls during Group Travel: Chirp and Wail
   Vocalization Use in the Male Ring-Tailed Lemur (Lemur catta)},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Affiliative vocalizations occur across primate taxa and may be used to
   maintain spatial cohesion and/or to regulate social interactions in
   group-living species. For gregarious strepsirhines like the ring-tailed
   lemur (Lemur catta), with large vocal repertoires and several distinct
   affiliative vocalizations including the chirp and wail, it is important
   to understand behavioural usage of these vocalizations to gain insight
   into their social interactions. To determine whether chirp and wail
   vocalizations facilitate group cohesion, regulate interactions to
   achieve socially positive outcomes, and are correlated with differences
   in individual characteristics such as dominance rank and age, I
   collected 565 h of focal data on 31 males aged >= 1 year at Beza
   Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar, from March to July 2010. I found
   that chirp and wail vocalizations occurred at the highest rates during
   group-wide travel compared to other behaviours. Although nearest
   neighbour distance did not influence calling rate, focal animals
   maintained the same distance or were located closer to nearest
   neighbours after calling. Both chirp and wail calls were heard in
   behavioural contexts without agonism rather than agonistic contexts. No
   relationship was found between male calling rate and dominance rank or
   age, although the chirp showed a non-significant tendency to be produced
   at higher rates by younger males. Overall, my results indicated that
   ring-tailed lemur males of all ages and dominance ranks used both chirp
   and wail vocalizations as contact calls during group-wide travel events,
   helping individuals maintain proximity to other group members during
   movement. Chirp and wail vocalizations may additionally help regulate
   the caller's social interactions and promote increased tolerance from
   conspecifics. These findings add to our understanding of the breadth of
   communication behaviour in wild lemurs, thus furthering our knowledge of
   the social lives and cognitive abilities of strepsirhines. Through
   examining the complexity of vocalization use by a living lemur species
   with a communication system much like early social primates, we gain
   broad insight into the evolution of primate sociality.},

   lemurs, Lemur catta},
Journal = {PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {226},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence of spontaneous
   food preferences in zoo-housed ring-tailed lemurs and to analyze whether
   these preferences correlate with nutrient composition. Using a
   two-alternative choice test three female and one male Lemur catta were
   repeatedly presented with all possible binary combinations of 12 types
   of food which are part of their diet in captivity and found to display
   the following rank order of preference: apple > sweet potato > melon >
   beetroot > carrot > egg > eggplant > pumpkin > cucumber > tomato >
   cabbage > mealworm. Correlational analyses revealed a highly significant
   positive correlation between this food preference ranking and the total
   carbohydrate and sucrose contents of the foods (p < 0.01, respectively).
   No other significant correlations with any other macro- or micronutrient
   were found. These results suggest that zoo-housed ring-tailed lemurs are
   not opportunistic, but selective feeders with regard to maximizing their
   net gain of energy as only the content of carbohydrates, but not the
   contents of total energy, proteins or lipids significantly correlated
   with the displayed food preferences. Further, we found that ring-tailed
   lemurs that were raised on a vegetable-based diet did not significantly
   differ in their food preferences, and in particular in their
   predilection for food items high in carbohydrates, from animals that had
   previously been fed a fruit-based diet. This suggests that the lemurs'
   preference for carbohydrate-rich food items may be innate and not
   affected by experience with different diets.},

Pages = {622-629},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Previous primate research has demonstrated social learning related to
   accepting novel foods, but little evidence suggests social learning of
   food avoidance. Ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)have been observed to
   shake their heads rapidly in response to sour and bitter stimuli. This
   study investigated whether this head-shaking behavior may have a social
   function. The experiment presented a performing lemur with two items of
   the same type of fruit, one of which had been manipulated to take on a
   sour flavor, and the other which was not manipulated and served as a
   control. The performer could taste each of the stimuli while an
   observing lemur had the opportunity to watch the performer's behavior
   from an adjacent enclosure. The observer was then presented with two
   stimuli with the same qualities. This study evaluated whether a
   preceding head-shaking reaction by the performer improved the success
   rate of the observer avoiding bitter stimuli to greater than chance. Our
   results reveal that following a head shake by the performer in response
   to the sour stimuli, observer avoidance of sour stimuli was
   statistically greater than chance, indicating that there may be social
   influences on food avoidance in this species. Further research should
   focus on confirming this effect and characterizing the full set of
   socially influential food reaction behaviors.},

Title = {Captive Dwarf and Mouse Lemurs Have Variable Fur Growth},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Next to nothing is known about fur or hair growth for any
   primate species aside from humans. Researchers have typically assumed
   that fur and hair growth is constant, but the available data suggest
   this is not the case. I investigated how quickly fur grows for two
   closely related species of small-bodied lemur, dwarf lemurs, and mouse
   lemurs at the Duke Lemur Center. I found that fur growth varied
   considerably both within and among individuals. Additionally, growth was
   overall slower and quite seasonally variable for dwarf lemurs. Seasonal
   fluctuations in fur regrowth likely reflect changes in metabolism
   related to photoperiod, a phenomenon that is widespread among
   vertebrates. Variable fur growth is problematic for any study that uses
   keratin to investigate seasonal changes in diet or health. Further
   research examining how variable fur and hair growth is across a larger
   array of species, between sexes, and across seasons is needed.
   Researchers typically assume constant fur and hair growth for primates,
   but the few studies that have investigated growth explicitly suggest
   this may not be the case. Instead, growth may vary considerably among
   individuals and across seasons. One might expect this variability to be
   most pronounced for species that have seasonally variable activity
   patterns (e.g., Madagascar's Cheiorogaleidae). In particular, dwarf
   lemurs (Cheirogaleusspp.) undergo considerable changes in their daily
   activity levels (torpor) in the austral fall, when nights get shorter. I
   monitored regrowth of shaved fur patches for eight adult captive
   fat-tailed dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus medius) and gray mouse lemurs
   (Microcebusmurinus) on a bi-weekly basis for 21 months in total.
   Regrowth varied considerably both within and among individuals. Overall,
   fur regrew in spurts and was faster for mouse lemurs (0-14 to 215-229
   days) than dwarf lemurs (27-40 to 313-327 days). There were significant
   differences between species and an obvious influence of season for dwarf
   lemurs, but no clear influence of shave location, age, or sex. Similar
   trends have been previously reported for captive lemurids, suggesting
   that seasonal fur growth may be widespread across Lemuroidea.
   Researchers are cautioned against using primate fur or hair to
   investigate variables confounded by seasonality (such as diet and body
   condition) until patterns of growth are better understood.},

Title = {Combination of intramuscular alfaxalone, butorphanol, and midazolam as a
   novel immobilization protocol in 3 ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)},
Journal = {IRISH VETERINARY JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {73},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Background There is very little data on the optimal anaesthetic
   management of ring-tailed lemurs, and the available information is
   mostly based on extrapolation from other species. In addition, a
   thorough pre-anaesthetic assessment of lemurs might not be possible
   without prior chemical immobilization, making a safe immobilization
   protocol essential. Case presentation Three ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur
   catta) were immobilized using a combination of intramuscular alfaxalone
   (5 mg/kg), butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg), and midazolam (0.2 mg/kg), at the
   University College Dublin Veterinary Hospital. One lemur was
   anaesthetised once, two lemurs twice, amounting to five anaesthetic
   events. Conversion to general anaesthesia was warranted in all five
   occasions, and anaesthesia was maintained with either sevoflurane in
   oxygen or alfaxalone infusion. The immobilization protocol provided an
   adequate duration of deep sedation for diagnostic procedures and in some
   occasions allowed the intubation of the trachea. Analgesia was also
   provided for minor procedures. No major complications were noted with
   the protocol used. Conclusions The combination of intramuscular
   alfaxalone, butorphanol and midazolam provided a clinically useful
   sedation/immobilization in ring-tailed lemurs with only minor
   complications such as mild hypothermia, hypotension, hypoventilation and
   bradycardia. This protocol could be considered in ring-tailed lemurs
   that need to be immobilized for minor procedures, or as a
   pre-anaesthetic premedication, especially if a full pre-anaesthetic
   clinical exam is not possible.},

Abstract = {Cardiac disease has been recognized as a major cause of death in captive
   nonhuman primates, which necessitates diagnostic (imaging) techniques to
   screen for and diagnose preclinical and clinical stages of possible
   cardiac conditions. Echocardiography is currently the most commonly used
   diagnostic tool for evaluation of cardiac anatomy and function. Complete
   with thoracic radiography and blood levels of two cardiac biomarkers,
   N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin
   T (cTnT), it gives an extensive examination of the cardiorespiratory
   system. The purpose of this cross-sectional cohort study is to describe
   normal thoracic anatomy using thoracic radiography, and to provide
   normal values for echocardiographic measurements in 20 ring-tailed
   lemurs (Lemur catta). Additionally, cardiac biomarkers were determined.
   Three radiographic projections of the thoracic cavity and a complete
   transthoracic echocardiography were performed in 20 clinically healthy
   ring-tailed lemurs during their annual health examinations. Similar
   standard right parasternal and left apical echocardiographic images were
   obtained as described in dogs and cats and normal values for routine
   two-dimensional (2D-), time-motion (M-) and Doppler mode measurements
   were generated. Furthermore, a noninvasive smartphone base ECG recording
   and blood concentrations of cardiac biomarkers were obtained. Other
   radiographic measurements are provided for the skeletal and respiratory
   systems such as the trachea to inlet ratio and tracheal inclination.
   Knowledge of the normal radiographic thoracic and echocardiographic
   anatomy and function are fundamental for the diagnosis and follow-up of
   cardiac disease in affected individuals and for species screening, and
   will be of added value in future research in and conservation of this
   endangered species.},

Abstract = {A total of 16 lemurs. including representatives from three species
   (Lemur catta. Eulemur rubriventer, and Varecia variegata). were
   presented with a food-seeking task in which information about the
   rewards location, in one of two plastic tubes, was either known or not
   known. We evaluated whether lemurs would first look into the tube before
   making a choice. This information-seeking task aimed to assess whether
   subjects would display memory awareness, seeking additional information
   when they became aware they lacked knowledge of the rewards location. We
   predicted lemurs would be more likely to look into the tube when they
   had insufficient knowledge about the rewards position. Lemurs
   successfully gained the reward on most trials. However, they looked on
   the majority of trials regardless of whether they had all the necessary
   information to make a correct choice. The minimal cost to looking may
   have resulted in checking behavior to both confirm what they already
   knew and gain knowledge they did not have. When the cost of looking
   increased (elevating the end of tube, requiring additional energy
   expenditure to look inside-Experiment 2). lemurs still looked into tubes
   on both seen and unseen trials; however, the frequency of looking
   increased when opaque tubes were used (where they could not see the
   rewards location after baiting). This could suggest they checked more
   when they were less sure of their knowledge state.},

Abstract = {Fruit-eating animals play important roles as seed dispersal agents in
   terrestrial systems. Yet, the extent to which seed dispersal by
   nocturnal omnivores may facilitate germination and the recruitment of
   plant communities has rarely been investigated. Characterizing their
   roles in seed dispersal is necessary to provide a more complete picture
   of how seed dispersal processes affect ecosystem functioning. We
   investigated the roles and impacts of two species of nocturnal
   omnivorous lemur species, Microcebus jollyae and M. rufus, on seed
   dispersal in Madagascar's rain forests, through analysis of fecal
   samples and germination experiments. Data show that these lemur species,
   which are among the world's smallest primates, dispersed 22 plant
   species from various forest strata and that the defecated seeds
   germinated faster and at higher rates than control seeds for the eight
   plant species we tested. Even though mouse lemurs dispersed both native
   and non-native plant species, non-native plant species represented a
   relatively small proportion (17\%). These results demonstrate that
   overlooked nocturnal omnivores can act as important seed dispersers,
   which may have critical implications for forest regeneration and the
   maintenance of plant diversity in fragmented/degraded forests. Finally,
   we provide critical insights into the previously unobserved behavior and
   diet of endangered nocturnal lemurs for their effective conservation.

Volume = {91},

Abstract = {Primate loud calls often encode information relating to species
   identity. A previous study of loud calls of fork-marked lemurs (genus
   Phaner) indicated differences among the calls of four populations that
   have been accorded species status on the grounds of morphology and
   biogeography: Phaner electromontis, P. parienti, P. furciferand P.
   pallescens. I made field recordings of two typical calls (kiu and kea)
   emitted by all four populations and conducted playback experiments in
   Kirindy Forest to investigate whether free-ranging P.
   pallescensindividuals could discriminate the loud calls of their own
   species from those of others. Individual response behaviour, social
   context and call type used in playback were analysed using a
   goodness-of-fit G test. The effect of specific call identity was
   significant, while the effects of context and call type were not.
   Individuals responded to P. pallescens calls by approaching the speaker,
   but not to the calls of other populations. P. pallescens individuals
   appear to be capable of distinguishing the loud calls of their
   conspecifics, but the fact that the habitat structure of the sites of
   recording and playback of P. pallescenscalls was similar sounds a note
   of caution. Future studies should repeat the experiments with the other
   populations of fork-marked lemurs.},

Title = {Do functional traits offset the effects of fragmentation? The case of
   large-bodied diurnal lemur species},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Primates worldwide are faced with increasing threats making them more
   vulnerable to extinction. Anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat
   degradation and fragmentation, are among the main concerns, and in
   Madagascar, these issues have become widespread. As this situation
   continues to worsen, we sought to understand how fragmentation affects
   primate distribution throughout the island. Further, because species may
   exhibit different sensitivity to fragmentation, we also aimed to
   estimate the role of functional traits in mitigating their response. We
   collated data from 32 large-bodied lemur species ranges, consisting of
   species from the families Lemuridae (five genera) and Indriidae (two
   genera). We fitted Generalized Linear Models to determine the role of
   habitat fragmentation characteristics, for example, forest cover, patch
   size, edge density, and landscape configuration, as well as the
   protected area (PA) network, on the species relative probability of
   presence. We then assessed how the influence of functional traits
   (dietary guild, home range size) mitigate the response of species to
   these habitat metrics. Habitat area had a strong positive effect for
   many species, and there were significantly negative effects of
   fragmentation on the distribution of many lemur species. In addition,
   there was a positive influence of PAs on many lemur species'
   distribution. Functional trait classifications showed that lemurs of all
   dietary guilds are negatively affected by fragmentation; however,
   folivore-frugivores show greater flexibility/variability in terms of
   habitat area and landscape complexity compared to nearly exclusive
   folivores and frugivores. Furthermore, species of all home range sizes
   showed a negative response to fragmentation, while habitat area had an
   increasingly positive effect as home range increased in size. Overall,
   the general trends for the majority of lemur species are dire and point
   to the need for immediate actions on a multitude of fronts, most
   importantly landscape-level reforestation efforts.},

Abstract = {Although roads are often assumed to be barriers to the dispersal of
   arboreal species, there has been little empirical testing of this
   assumption. If arboreal animals are unable to cross roads, population
   subdivision may occur, or resources may become inaccessible. We tested
   the hypothesis that Route Nationale 4 (RN4), a paved highway, was a
   barrier to movement and dispersal of the Endangered golden-brown mouse
   lemur Microcebus ravelobensis in Ankarafantsika National Park, in
   north-west Madagascar. During June-August 2015 we conducted a
   capture-mark-recapture study at three sites: two adjacent to RN4 and one
   within intact forest without a potential barrier. During 2,294 trap
   nights we captured 120 golden-brown mouse lemurs 1,032 times. In
   roadside habitats we captured significantly more males than females,
   whereas the opposite was the case in interior forest habitat. We
   detected eighteen crossings of highway transects by nine individuals;
   however, all potential dispersal events involved males. In roadside
   habitat, movement was significantly inhibited in both males and females.
   We present some of the first data on the effects of roads on movement
   patterns in arboreal Malagasy mammals, showing species- and sex-biased
   effects of roads as dispersal barriers. Our findings indicate that roads
   may not be complete barriers to dispersal in lemurs. We recommend that
   conservation managers and scientists examine explicitly the effects of
   roads and natural arboreal bridges in Madagascar in future studies.},

Title = {Daily Torpor and Sleep in a Non-human Primate, the Gray Mouse Lemur
   (Microcebus murinus)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Month = {SEP 24},
Abstract = {Daily torpor is an energy-saving process that evolved as an extension of
   non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep mechanisms. In many heterothermic
   species there is a relation between torpor expression and the
   repartition of the different behavioral states of sleep. Despite the
   presence of sleep during this period of hypothermia, torpor induces an
   accumulation of sleep debt which results in a rebound of sleep in
   mammals. We aimed to investigate the expression of sleep-wake rhythms
   and delta waves during daily torpor at various ambient temperatures in a
   non-human primate model, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus).
   Cortical activity was measured with telemetric electroencephalography
   (EEG) recordings in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during the torpor
   episode and the next 24 h following hypothermia. Gray mouse lemurs were
   divided into two groups: the first group was subjected to normal ambient
   temperatures (25 degrees C) whereas the second group was placed at lower
   ambient temperatures (10 degrees C). Contrary to normal ambient
   temperatures, sleep-wake rhythms were maintained during torpor until
   body temperature (Tb) of the animals reached 21 degrees C. Below this
   temperature, NREM and REM sleep strongly decreased or were absent
   whereas the EEG became isoelectric. The different states of sleep were
   proportional to Tb-min during prior torpor in contrast to active phases.
   Delta waves increased after torpor but low Tb did not induce greater
   delta power compared to higher temperatures. Our results showed that Tb
   was a determining factor for the quality and quantity of sleep. Low Tb
   might be inconsistent with the recovery function of sleep. Heterothermy
   caused a sleep debt thus there was a rebound of sleep at the beginning
   of euthermia to compensate for the lack of sleep.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Environmental enrichment has become a standard tool for improving the
   welfare of animals in zoos. Two critical steps in the manipulation of
   environmental enrichment are (1) selection of objects/procedures and (2)
   evaluation of their effects. In this study, we examined the selection
   and evaluation of feeding enrichment for four species of lemur.
   Experiment 1 used a paired-choice preference assessment to divide eight
   food items into high- and low-preferred categories. Experiment 2
   separately assessed the effects of high- versus low-preferred items
   (placed in bamboo dispensers) on the behavior of two of the species in
   the preference assessment. Both high- and low-preferred items increased
   general activity and overall enclosure use, with high-preferred items
   having a greater effect than low-preferred items on most measures. The
   results suggest that preference assessments can serve as useful tools in
   selecting potential enrichment and that enrichment testing is important
   in evaluating the significance of these preferences.},

Title = {The Biological Clock in Gray Mouse Lemur: Adaptive, Evolutionary and
   Aging Considerations in an Emerging Non-human Primate Model},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {Circadian rhythms, which measure time on a scale of 24 h, are
   genetically generated by the circadian clock, which plays a crucial role
   in the regulation of almost every physiological and metabolic process in
   most organisms. This review gathers all the available information about
   the circadian clock in a small Malagasy primate, the gray mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus), and reports 30 years data from the historical
   colony at Brunoy (France). Although the mouse lemur has long been seen
   as a ``primitive{''} species, its clock displays high phenotypic
   plasticity, allowing perfect adaptation of its biological rhythms to
   environmental challenges (seasonality, food availability). The
   alterations of the circadian timing system in M. murinus during aging
   show many similarities with those in human aging. Comparisons are drawn
   with other mammalian species (more specifically, with rodents, other
   non-human primates and humans) to demonstrate that the gray mouse lemur
   is a good complementary and alternative model for studying the circadian
   clock and, more broadly, brain aging and pathologies.},

Abstract = {Detecting the risk of infection and minimizing parasite exposure
   represent the first lines of host defence against parasites. Individuals
   differ in the expression of these behavioural defences, but causes of
   such variation have received little empirical attention. We therefore
   experimentally investigated the effects of several individual and
   environmental factors on the expression level of faecal avoidance in the
   context of feeding, drinking, sleeping and defecating in a wild primate
   population. We found a strong sex bias in the expression level of
   anti-parasite behaviours of grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), with
   only females strongly avoiding contaminated food, water and nests, and
   exhibiting selective defecation. Our results further suggest that
   individuals adapted their protective behaviours according to variation
   in intrinsic and ecological factors that may influence the cost-benefit
   balance of behavioural defences. Overall, individuals exhibited high
   consistency of investment in protective behaviours across behavioural

   hygienic personalities. Finally, the global hygienic score was
   negatively correlated with faecal-orally transmitted parasite richness,
   suggesting that variation in behavioural defence has fitness
   consequences. We suggest that integrating inter-individual variation in
   behavioural defences in epidemiological studies should improve our
   ability to model disease spread within populations.},

Title = {A natural point mutation in the bitter taste receptor TAS2R16 causes
   inverse agonism of arbutin in lemur gustation},

Abstract = {Bitter taste enables the detection of potentially harmful substances and
   is mediated by bitter taste receptors, TAS2Rs, in vertebrates. Few
   antagonists and inverse agonists of TAS2Rs have been identified,
   especially natural compounds. TAS2R16s in humans, apes and Old World
   monkeys (Catarrhini, Anthropoidea) recognize beta-glucoside analogues as
   specific agonists. Here, investigated responses of TAS2R16 to
   beta-glucosides in non-anthropoid primates, namely lemurs (Lemuriformes,
   Strepsirrhini). Salicin acted as an agonist on lemur TAS2R16. Arbutin
   acted as an agonist in the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur calla) but as an
   inverse agonist in black lemur (Eulemur macaco) and black-and-white
   ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata). We identified a strepsirrhine-specific
   amino acid substitution responsible for the inverse agonism of arbutin.
   In a food preference test, salicin bitterness was inhibited by arbutin
   in the black lemur. Structural modelling revealed this locus was
   important for a rearrangement of the intracellular end of transmembrane
   helix 7 (TM7). Accordingly, arbutin is the first known natural inverse
   agonist of TAS2Rs, contributing to our understanding of receptor-ligand
   interactions and the molecular basis of the unique feeding habit
   diversification in lemurs. Furthermore, the identification of a causal
   point mutation suggests that TAS2R can acquire functional changes
   according to feeding habits and environmental conditions.},

Title = {A description of nesting behaviors, including factors impacting nest
   site selection, in black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata)},

Abstract = {Nest site selection is at once fundamental to reproduction and a poorly
   understood component of many organisms' reproductive investment. This
   study investigates the nesting behaviors of black-and-white ruffed
   lemurs, Varecia variegata, a litter-bearing primate from the
   southeastern rainforests of Madagascar. Using a combination of
   behavioral, geospatial, and demographic data, I test the hypotheses that
   environmental and social cues influence nest site selection and that
   these decisions ultimately impact maternal reproductive success.
   Gestating females built multiple large nests throughout their
   territories. Of these, females used only a fraction of the originally
   constructed nests, as well as several parking locations as infants aged.
   Nest construction was best predicted by environmental cues, including
   the size of the nesting tree and density of feeding trees within a 75m
   radius of the nest, whereas nest use depended largely on the size and
   average distance to feeding trees within that same area. Microhabitat
   characteristics were unrelated to whether females built or used nests.
   Although unrelated to nest site selection, social cues, specifically the
   average distance to conspecifics' nest and park sites, were related to
   maternal reproductive success; mothers whose litters were parked in
   closer proximity to others' nests experienced higher infant survival
   than those whose nests were more isolated. This is likely because
   nesting proximity facilitated communal creche use by neighboring
   females. Together, these results suggest a complex pattern of nesting
   behaviors that involves females strategically building nests in areas
   with high potential resource abundance, using nests in areas according
   to their realized productivity, and communally rearing infants within a
   network of nests distributed throughout the larger communal territory.},

Title = {A 3D population-based brain atlas of the mouse lemur primate with
   examples of applications in aging studies and comparative anatomy},

Abstract = {The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is a small prosimian of
   growing interest for studies of primate biology and evolution, and
   notably as a model organism of brain aging. As brain atlases are
   essential tools for brain investigation, the objective of the current
   work was to create the first 3D digital atlas of the mouse lemur brain.
   For this, a template image was constructed from in vivo magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) data of 34 animals. This template was then
   manually segmented into 40 cortical, 74 subcortical and 6 cerebro-spinal
   fluid (CSF) regions. Additionally, we generated probability maps of gray
   matter, white matter and CSF. The template, manual segmentation and
   probability maps, as well as imaging tools used to create and manipulate
   the template, can all be freely downloaded. The atlas was first used to
   automatically assess regional age-associated cerebral atrophy in a
   cohort of mouse lemurs previously studied by voxel based morphometry
   (VBM). Results based on the atlas were in good agreement with the VBM
   ones, showing age-associated atrophy in the same brain regions such as
   the insular, parietal or occipital cortices as well as the thalamus or
   hypothalamus. The atlas was also used as a tool for comparative
   neuroanatomy. To begin with, we compared measurements of brain regions
   in our MRI data with histology-based measures from a reference article
   largely used in previous comparative neuroanatomy studies. We found
   large discrepancies between our MRI-based data and those of the
   reference histology-based article. Next, regional brain volumes were
   compared amongst the mouse lemur and several other mammalian species
   where high quality volumetric MRI brain atlases were available,
   including rodents (mouse, rat) and primates (marmoset, macaque, and
   human). Unlike those based on histological atlases, measures from MRI
   atlases indicated similar cortical to cerebral volume indices in all
   primates, including in mouse lemurs, and lower values in mice. On the
   other hand, white matter to cerebral volume index increased from rodents
   to small primates (mouse lemurs and marmosets) to macaque, reaching
   their highest values in humans.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to find an innovative strategy for
   controling progresivity of bone destruction on periodontal that caused
   by diabetic condition. Methods: Wistar rats sample are devided into 4
   group; negative control group, 3 group with lemuru fish oil
   supplementation (4ml/kg of weight t, 8ml/kg of weight and 16ml/kg of
   weight). One week before treatment all group induced with STZ 65ml/KgBB
   and nicotinamide 110ml/KgBB to produced diabetes conditions.
   Immunohistochemistry slide of periodontal tissue was prepare after 3
   weeks therapy. RUNX2 was count using HSCORE index, and osteoblast cell
   amount was count using image raster by optilab program. Results:
   Statistical analyses demonstrated a significant increase of RUNX2
   expression in negative control group compare to treatment group (p <
   0,05), and in treatment group showing less of RUNX2 expression (p <
   0,05). Meanwhile Osteoblast cell amount was found increased and has
   significant difference in group 8ml/kg among other groups (p < 0,05) and
   lower osteoblast cell result in control group. The result lead to
   another mechanism that may involved in bone formation to induced
   osteoblast cell proliferation beside trancript factor RUNX2 which showed
   by treatment group of 8ml/kgWeight. Conclusion: The stimulation of
   osteoblast cell in diabetic condition can be induced by lemuru fish oil
   treatment, which regulated by another pathway mechanism beside
   transcript factor RUNX2.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of grooming makes it possible to characterize the intragroup
   social connections of lemurs and accurately form groups in captivity.
   The results of this study showed that there are no significant
   differences in grooming between the black-and-white and red ruffed
   lemurs: in both subspecies, allogrooming is associated with a certain
   time of day to a lesser extent than autogrooming. In allogrooming, both
   subspecies of lemurs clean mainly those parts of the body that are
   difficult to reach for self-cleaning. An asymmetry in the distribution
   of allogrooming was revealed: a negative correlation between the age and
   frequency of the initiated mutual cleaning, predominance of grooming in
   male-female dyads and between related animals. Allogrooming in ruffed
   lemurs has three main contexts: the maintenance and establishment of
   social ties, pacification and buffer of aggression, and restoration of
   disturbed relations between social partners.},

Abstract = {Mutual (simultaneous) grooming occurs in a variety of mammals and is
   characterized by a distinct payoff structure compared to unidirectional
   grooming, as in mutual (but not in unidirectional) grooming both
   partners simultaneously get the benefits of the receipt of grooming.
   Mutual grooming, however, has been very little investigated. We studied
   a captive group of ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, to test the
   hypothesis that mutual grooming functions to prolong grooming received.
   Lemurs were more likely to initiate grooming when they were being
   groomed than when they were simply approached by a group mate. They were
   also less likely to terminate grooming if their partner was
   simultaneously grooming them. These results support the hypothesis that
   mutual grooming represents a form of immediate repayment of cooperation
   received that facilitates further investment by the partner. It remains
   to be ascertained how natural selection may favour mutual over
   unidirectional grooming in different social and ecological conditions.

Title = {Local awareness and perceptions: consequences for conservation of marsh

Abstract = {Management and monitoring of community-based protected areas in
   Madagascar remain challenging because of a lack of financial, human and
   technical resources, and capacity. At Lake Alaotra, conversion of
   marshland for rice cultivation and a lack of effective habitat
   protection have pushed the locally endemic Alaotra gentle lemur
   Hapalemur alaotrensis to the brink of extinction. The highest density of
   the species is found in the locally managed Park Bandro, a high-priority
   conservation zone within the Lake Alaotra New Protected Area. We
   evaluated local awareness and perceptions of Park Bandro, and discussed
   preferred management options with local communities. Two questionnaire
   surveys were carried out, one with 180 participants at six sites around
   the lake and marsh, and another with 50 participants in the village
   adjacent to Park Bandro. The majority of participants knew of the
   existence of Park Bandro but most did not know its purpose or size.
   Values and perceptions of local communities were influenced by
   occupation and distance to the Park, with fishers being most aware of
   the Park. We found that local people had a high level of environmental
   awareness and were willing to discuss zonation and alternative resource
   management strategies as long as these activities could provide a
   tangible livelihood benefit. Lack of awareness among local resource
   users regarding the purpose and status of protected areas such as Park
   Bandro is a challenge that needs to be addressed, and one that is
   relevant for environmental education and management of protected areas
   throughout Madagascar.},

Abstract = {Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica are ubiquitous
   pathogens with wildlife and domestic animal reservoirs. Outbreaks of
   `non-plague' yersiniosis in man and non-human primates are reported
   frequently (including zoological specimens and research breeding
   colonies) and are usually characterized by enteritis, mesenteric
   lymphadenitis and occasionally organ abscessation. In people, non-septic
   reactive arthritis is a common sequela to yersiniosis. However, there
   have been rare reports in people of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis
   because of active systemic infection with Y. pseudotuberculosis.
   Osteomyelitis has also been reported rarely in historical yersiniosis
   outbreaks in farmed turkeys in England and the USA. This paper reports
   the first case of osteomyelitis caused by systemic infection with Y.
   pseudotuberculosis 0:1 in a non-human primate, a captive ringtailed
   lemur (Lemur catta). The lemur had a short clinical history of hyporexia
   and weight loss with reduction in mobility, especially of the left
   hindlimb. On post-mortem examination there was evidence of multi-organ
   abscessation. In addition, severe necrosis, inflammation and large
   bacterial colonies were present in the musculature, periosteum and bone
   marrow in the hip, ribs and a vertebra at the cervicothoracic junction.
   Osteomyelitis should be considered as a rare clinical presentation in
   non-human primates with systemic Y. pseudotuberculosis infection. (C)

Year = {2018},
Volume = {59},
Number = {4},
Pages = {355-360},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Fork-marked dwarf lemurs (Phaner spp.) of Madagascar and the
   needle-clawed galagos (Euoticus spp.) of Central-West Africa are two
   genera within the primate suborder Strepsirrhini. Despite their distant
   relationship, these genera share remarkably convergent anatomical,
   behavioural and ecological characteristics. However, like most nocturnal
   primates in sub-Saharan Africa they are poorly studied and little is
   known about the population estimates of both genera. I conducted surveys
   of wild populations of Phaner pallescens, P. parienti and P. furcifer in
   Madagascar as well as Euoticus elegantulus and E. pallidus in Cameroon.
   Six transects were established in Madagascar covering a total distance
   of 20 km, within which I encountered 52 fork-marked dwarf lemurs. In
   Cameroon three transects were established covering a total distance of
   8.5 km, and 56 encounters of needle-clawed galagos were made. Population
   encounter rates of P. pallescens, P. parienti, P. furcifer, E.
   elegantulus and E. pallidus were 3.3, 2.4, 2.3, 9.9 and 8.3 individuals
   per kilometre, respectively. Compared to previous estimates of
   population encounter rates in other study sites, these values are lower.
   Low population encounter rates of fork-marked dwarf lemurs and
   needle-clawed galagos may be due to environmental and anthropogenic
   pressures at the study sites. Further ecological, behavioural and
   conservation studies are required for these genera.},

Title = {Genome sequence and population declines in the critically endangered
   greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) and implications for conservation},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JUN 8},
Abstract = {Background: The greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) is a member of the
   Family Lemuridae that is unique in their dependency on bamboo as a
   primary food source. This Critically Endangered species lives in small
   forest patches in eastern Madagascar, occupying a fraction of its
   historical range. Here we sequence the genome of the greater bamboo
   lemur for the first time, and provide genome resources for future
   studies of this species that can be applied across its distribution.
   Results: Following whole genome sequencing of five individuals we
   identified over 152,000 polymorphic single nucleotide variants (SNVs),
   and evaluated geographic structuring across nearly 19 k SNVs. We
   characterized a stronger signal associated with a north-south divide
   than across elevations for our limited samples. We also evaluated the
   demographic history of this species, and infer a dramatic population
   crash. This species had the largest effective population size (estimated
   between similar to 900,000 to one million individuals) between
   approximately 60,000-90,000 years before present (ybp), during a time in
   which global climate change affected terrestrial mammals worldwide. We
   also note the single sample from the northern portion of the extant
   range had the largest effective population size around 35,000 ybp.
   Conclusions: From our whole genome sequencing we recovered an average
   genomic heterozygosity of 0.0037\%, comparable to other lemurs. Our
   demographic history reconstructions recovered a probable climate-related
   decline (60-90,000 ybp), followed by a second population decrease
   following human colonization, which has reduced the species to a census
   size of approximately 1000 individuals. The historical distribution was
   likely a vast portion of Madagascar, minimally estimated at 44,259
   km(2), while the contemporary distribution is only similar to 1700
   km(2). The decline in effective population size of 89-99.9\%
   corresponded to a vast range retraction. Conservation management of this
   species is crucial to retain genetic diversity across the remaining
   isolated populations.},

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Objective The aim of this study was to assess the practicability of
   common tonometers used in veterinary medicine for rapid intraocular
   pressure (IOP) screening, to calibrate IOP values gained by the
   tonometers, and to define a reference IOP value for the healthy eye in a
   new primate model for aging research, the gray mouse lemur.
   Studied animals and procedures TonoVet((R)) and the TonoPen (TM)
   measurements were calibrated manometrically in healthy enucleated eyes
   of mouse lemurs euthanized for veterinary reasons. For comparison of the
   practicability of both tonometers as a rapid IOP assessment tool for
   living mouse lemurs, the IOP of 24 eyes of 12 animals held in the hand
   was measured. To define a standard reference value for IOP in mouse
   lemurs, 258 healthy animals were measured using the TonoVet((R)).
   Results Intraocular pressure measurements for the TonoVet((R)) can be
   corrected using the formula: y = 0.981 + (1.962{*}TonoVet((R)) value),
   and those for the TonoPen using that of y = 5.38 + (1.426{*}TonoPen (TM)
   value). The calibrated IOP for a healthy mouse lemur eye was 20.3 2.8
   mmHg. The TonoVet((R)) showed advantages in practicability, for example,
   small corneal contact area, short and painless corneal contact,
   shortened total time spent on investigation, as well as the more
   accurate measured values. IOP measurements of healthy mouse lemur eyes
   were not affected by age, sex, eye side, or colony.
   Conclusion Tonometry using TonoVet((R)) is the more practicable
   assessment tool for IOP measurement of the tiny eyes of living mouse
   lemurs. Pathological deviations can be identified based on the described
   reference value.},

Abstract = {Objective To evaluate the clinical effects and quality of sedation,
   induction, maintenance and recovery in Lemur catta after
   dexmedetomidine-butorphanol-midazolam sedation and alfaxalone
   anaesthesia.
   Study design Prospective, observational study.
   Animals Six male L. catta weighing 3.0 +/- 0.6 kg undergoing surgical
   castration.
   Methods Lemurs were sedated with intramuscular dexmedetomidine (0.015 mg
   kg(-1)), butorphanol (0.2 mg kg(-1)) and midazolam (0.2 mg kg(-1)).
   Anaesthesia was induced with intravenous alfaxalone 0.5 mg kg(-1) over
   60 seconds; further boluses were administered until tracheal intubation
   was feasible and final dose recorded. Alfaxalone continuous infusion was
   used to maintain anaesthesia. Atipamezole (0.15mgkg(-1)) was
   administered during recovery. The quality of sedation, induction,
   intubation, maintenance and recovery was assessed using a scoring
   system. Physiological parameters were recorded during sedation,
   maintenance and recovery.
   Results Sedation was achieved in 13.6 +/- 5.6 minutes and no reactions
   were observed during handling or venepuncture. The mean dose of
   alfaxalone required for induction and maintenance was 2.09 +/- 0.65 and
   0.08 +/- 0.02 mg kg(-1) minuteD(-1), respectively. Quality of induction,
   intubation and maintenance was good in almost all animals. Mild
   self-limiting muscle twitching was observed after alfaxalone
   administration in three animals. Cardiorespiratory function was stable
   in all animals but one. One lemur showed respiratory depression and
   required oxygen administration and manual ventilation. The mean
   maintenance time was 29.2 +/- 7.4 minutes. The mean times from the end
   of alfaxalone administration to extubation, atipamezole administration
   and full recovery were: 15.3 +/- 8.0, 22.2 +/- 4.6 and 60.0 +/- 8.4
   minutes, respectively. Recovery was considered good in all animals.
   Conclusions and clinical relevance Dexmedetomidine-butorphanol-midazolam
   combination provided reliable sedation and adequate muscle relaxation in
   L. catta. Alfaxalone proved to be a useful drug for induction and
   maintenance of anaesthesia and might be considered an option for
   injectable anaesthesia in lemurs.},

Abstract = {The blue-eyed black lemur (Eulemur flavifrons) is classified by the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as critically
   endangered. A 23-year-old male housed at Mulhouse Zoo presented with
   lethargy, polyphagia, alopecia, and chronic weight loss. Clinical
   examination suggested an endocrine pathology such as hyperthyroidism.
   Secondary examinations included cervical ultrasound, thyroid biopsy, and
   scintigraphy. The latter revealed elevated thyroid activity. Blood
   analysis was performed to measure the level of anti-receptor
   thyroid-stimulating hormone antibodies, which allowed us to test the
   autoimmune hypothesis. The high level of antibodies together with levels
   of thyroid-stimulating hormone and the scintigraphy images led to the
   diagnosis of Grave's disease. Carbimazole treatment followed by
   thyroidectomy resulted in a quick weight gain and general improvement in
   health status. The following breeding season, the treated individual
   sired an offspring. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report
   of likely Grave's disease in a non-human primate.},

Abstract = {1. Vertebrate gut microbiota form a key component of immunity and a
   dynamic link between an individual and the ecosystem. Microbiota might
   play a role in social systems as well, because microbes are transmitted
   during social contact and can affect host behaviour.
   2. Combining methods from behavioural and molecular research, we
   describe the relationship between social dynamics and gut microbiota of
   a group-living cooperative species of primate, the red-bellied lemur
   (Eulemur rubriventer). Specifically, we ask whether patterns of social
   contact (group membership, group size, position in social network,
   individual sociality) are associated with patterns of gut microbial
   composition (diversity and similarity) between individuals and across
   time.
   3. Red-bellied lemurs were found to have gut microbiota with slight
   temporal fluctuations and strong social group-specific composition.
   Contrary to expectations, individual sociality was negatively associated
   with gut microbial diversity. However, position within the social
   network predicted gut microbial composition.
   4. These results emphasize the role of the social environment in
   determining the microbiota of adult animals. Since social transmission
   of gut microbiota has the potential to enhance immunity, microbiota
   might have played an escalating role in the evolution of sociality.},

Title = {Plasma Amyloid Is Associated with White Matter and Subcortical
   Alterations and Is Modulated by Age and Seasonal Rhythms in Mouse Lemur
   Primates},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE},

Abstract = {Accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides in the brain is a
   critical early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD),
   the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder. There is
   increasing interest in measuring levels of plasma A beta since this
   could help in diagnosis of brain pathology. However, the value of plasma
   A beta in such a diagnosis is still controversial and factors modulating
   its levels are still poorly understood. The mouse lemur (Microcebus
   murinus) is a primate model of cerebral aging which can also present
   with amyloid plaques and whose A beta is highly homologous to humans'.
   In an attempt to characterize this primate model and to evaluate the
   potential of plasma A beta as a biomarker for brain alterations, we
   measured plasma A beta(40) concentration in 21 animals aged from 5 to
   9.5 years. We observed an age-related increase in plasma A beta(40)
   levels. We then evaluated the relationships between plasma A beta 40
   levels and cerebral atrophy in these mouse lemurs. Voxel-based analysis
   of cerebral MR images (adjusted for the age/sex/brain size of the
   animals), showed that low A beta(40) levels are associated with atrophy
   of several white matter and subcortical brain regions. These results
   suggest that low A beta(40) levels in middle-aged/old animals are
   associated with brain deterioration. One special feature of mouse lemurs
   is that their metabolic and physiological parameters follow seasonal
   changes strictly controlled by illumination. We evaluated
   seasonal-related variations of plasma A beta(40) levels and found a
   strong effect, with higher plasma A beta(40) concentrations in winter
   conditions compared to summer. This question of seasonal modulation of A
   beta plasma levels should be addressed in clinical studies. We also
   focused on the amplitude of the difference between plasma A beta(40)
   levels during the two seasons and found that this amplitude increases
   with age. Possible mechanisms leading to these seasonal changes are
   discussed.},

Title = {The role of facial pattern variation for species recognition in
   red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons)},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {FEB 13},
Abstract = {Background: Species recognition, i.e., the ability to distinguish
   conspecifics from heterospecifics, plays an essential role in
   reproduction. The role of facial cues for species recognition has been
   investigated in several non-human primate species except for lemurs. We
   therefore investigated the role of facial cues for species recognition
   in wild red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) at Kirindy Forest. We
   presented adult red-fronted lemurs pictures of male faces from five
   species including red-fronted lemurs, three closely related species,
   white-fronted lemurs (E. albifrons), brown lemurs (E. fulvus), rufous
   brown lemurs (E. rufus), and genetically more distant red-bellied lemurs
   (E. rubriventer), occurring in allopatry with the study population. We
   predicted that red-fronted lemurs respond stronger to conspecific than
   to heterospecific pictures and that females show stronger responses than
   males. In addition, if genetic drift has played a role in the evolution
   of facial color patterns in the members of this genus, we predicted that
   responses of red-fronted lemurs correlate negatively with the genetic
   distance to the different species stimuli.
   Results: Red-fronted lemurs looked significantly longer at pictures of
   their own species than at those of heterospecifics. Females spent less
   time looking at pictures of white-fronted, brown and red-bellied lemurs
   than males did, but not to pictures of red-bellied lemurs and a control
   stimulus. Individuals also exhibited sniffing behavior while looking at
   visual stimuli, and the time spent sniffing was significantly longer for
   pictures of conspecifics compared to those of heterospecifics. Moreover,
   the time spent looking and sniffing towards the pictures correlated
   negatively with the genetic distance between their own species and the
   species presented as stimulus.
   Conclusions: We conclude that red-fronted lemurs have the ability for
   species recognition using visual facial cues, which may allow them to
   avoid costly interbreeding. If so, sexual selection might have
   influenced the evolution of facial patterns in eulemurs. Since responses
   also correlated with genetic distance, our findings suggest a potential
   role of genetic drift as well as sexual selection in influencing the
   evolution of facial variation in eulemurs. Because study subjects looked
   and sniffed towards the presented pictures, red-fronted lemurs might
   have the ability for multi-modal species recognition.},

Abstract = {Extensive areas of forest are cleared every year to establish new
   agricultural land in the tropics, resulting in a catastrophic loss in
   habitat for the world's primates. A prominent example of this process is
   Madagascar, where an increasing demand for arable land has led to the
   once-forested landscape to be now dominated by agricultural areas used
   for the cultivation of food and cash crops. Despite the prominence of
   these plantations throughout Madagascar, their suitability as a habitat
   to support endemic lemur populations remains unclear. Here, we assessed
   lemur presence in vanilla plantations, Madagascar's principal export
   crop, within the northeastern Sava region with the use of line
   transects. We confirmed the presence of five lemur species, four of
   which were nocturnal cheirogaleids, in these vanilla plantations.
   Intensively farmed vanilla plantations and those in existing stands of
   vegetation supported at least one species of lemur. Furthermore, lemurs
   were significantly more likely to be present in plantations grown close
   or adjacent to natural forest fragments, compared to more intensively
   farmed, anthropogenic sites. In comparison, we observed eight lemur
   species in natural forest fragment sites in close proximity to the
   vanilla plantation sites, four of which we did not observe in any of the
   plantation sites. Our results provide evidence of lemurs using vanilla
   plantations and show that vanilla plantations may act as extensions of
   suitable habitat for lemurs, suggesting that they may also function as
   matrices between isolated forest fragments through which gene flow can
   occur. These are important and encouraging findings for both lemur
   conservation and for sustainable agroforestry undertaken by local
   farming communities.},

Title = {Parentage complexity in socially monogamous lemurs (Eulemur
   rubriventer): Integrating genetic and observational data},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {80},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Genetic analyses of parentage sometimes reveal that socially monogamous
   (pair-living) species do not reside in strict family groups.
   Circumstances such as adult turnovers and extra-pair copulations, among
   others, may result in non-nuclear families. These genetic relationships
   within groups have implications for interpreting social behaviors.
   Red-bellied lemurs (Eulemur rubriventer) live in groups generally
   comprising an adult male-female pair plus immatures, and early genetic
   analyses of parentage in a relatively small sample suggested they mate
   monogamously. However, previous research on this taxon has also
   identified scenarios in which non-nuclear families might result, such as
   adult turnovers. To assess the potential occurrence of non-nuclear
   families in this socially monogamous taxon, as well as the social
   conditions under which they might occur, we combined behavioral
   observations of wild red-bellied lemurs in Ranomafana National Park with
   genetic parentage analysis of immatures from 17 groups. We found that
   the majority of groups (75\%) represented nuclear family groups.
   However, 25\% of groups represented non-nuclear families at some point
   during the study. The social factors that resulted in non-nuclear
   families were varied and included at least one adult turnover, and
   potentially delayed female dispersals and extra-pair copulations. Our
   results suggest that red-bellied lemurs are generally reproductively
   monogamous, with only limited evidence that non-nuclear families result
   from non-monogamous reproduction. However, similar to other pair-living
   primates, red-bellied lemurs appear to exhibit flexibility in their
   social organization and mating strategies. Multiple lines of evidence
   should be considered when inferring parent-offspring relationships
   within pair-living groups.},

Abstract = {The jaw adductor muscles of extinct mammals are often reconstructed to
   elucidate paleoecological relationships and to make broad comparisons
   among taxa. Muscle lever arms, bite load arms, muscle dimensions, and
   gape are often also reconstructed to better understand feeding. Several
   different approaches to these and related goals are discussed here. A
   protocol for reconstructing muscle dimensions and bite force using
   biomechanically informative skull measurements and osteological proxies
   of muscle dimensions is described and applied to a case study of
   subfossil Malagasy lemurs. The results of this case study show that most
   subfossil lemurs emphasized the masseter and medial pterygoid muscles
   over the temporalis. This supports the inference that these extinct
   lemurs depended heavily on tough food like leaves. Exceptions include
   signals of hard-object feeding in Archaeolemur that vary between A.
   majori and A. edwardsi. Reconstructions of soft-tissue and function are
   important for understanding past ecological relationships. Even those
   based on well-supported osteological proxies from extant analogues have
   limitations for making precise inferences. (C) 2018 Wiley Periodicals,

Title = {The effects of olfactory stimulation on the behavior of captive

Journal = {ZOO BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},

Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Ring-tailed lemurs reside in many animal collections worldwide. Lemur
   welfare may be a cause of concern due to some captive individuals
   exhibiting stereotypic behavior. Despite these concerns, there has been
   little exploration of methods of environmental enrichment for
   ring-tailed lemurs. Olfactory stimulation can enhance captive animal
   welfare by encouraging species-typical behaviors, enhancing behavioral
   diversity, and decreasing stereotypic behaviors. We aimed to investigate
   the effects of olfactory stimulation via lavender, peppermint, coconut,
   and prey odor upon the behavior of eight captive ring-tailed lemurs. We
   exposed the lemurs to six individual odor conditions (odor control,
   novel object control, lavender, peppermint, coconut, and Morio worms)
   and observed them for 4hr a day for 3 days with an intervening period of
   4 days between conditions. We recorded the lemurs' behavior under each
   condition using instantaneous scan sampling. We found significant
   effects of olfactory stimulation on the ring-tailed lemurs' behavior in
   the initial analysis but these did not survive correction for multiple
   testing. Overall, while our findings are suggestive of a general effect
   of olfactory stimulation on the captive ring-tailed lemurs they did not
   indicate a marked influence of olfactory condition. However, further
   investigation with a larger sample size and more biologically relevant
   odors may be beneficial to fully examine potential effects of olfactory
   stimulation in captive lemurs.},

Title = {Museum collections are the key to studying lemurs' diet:
   gastrointestinal morphology of Cheirogaleus major},
Journal = {SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {483-487},
Abstract = {This study reports the first description of the gastrointestinal (GIT)
   morphology of a lemur species (Cheirogaleus major E. Geoffroy, 1812) of
   the family Cheirogaleidae using a museum collection deposited at the
   Natural History Museum, London. Knowledge on GIT morphology is the key
   to assessment of the diet of animals, especially those that are highly
   threatened. Several studies predicted the demise of lemurs (>100 species
   representing 20\% of the world's primate diversity) by 2080 unless the
   conservation community acts quickly. In this context, museum collections
   could provide valuable evidence on the biology of lemurs to underpin
   conservation protocols. The feeding ecology of the omnivorous
   Cheirogaleus major is poorly known due to its secretive periods of
   hibernation and daily torpor, nocturnal activity and solitary foraging
   habit. To better understand the biology of C. major, we described and
   compared its GIT morphology with those of six other species for which we
   have published data, especially the frugivore taxa (Eulemur coronatus
   Grey, 1842 and Varecia variegata Kerr, 1792). Our findings showed that
   C. major has a GIT morphology similar to those of E. coronatus and V.
   variegata. This is especially the case because of its caecum, which is
   short and only slightly sacculated suggesting that it is not suitable
   for microbial breakdown of plant cell wall (unlike those of Propithecus
   species, Lemur catta, and Hapalemur griseus). This result is in line
   with ecological studies suggesting that C. major obtains its protein and
   carbohydrate intake from fruits and to some extent arthropods and not
   from the digestion of leaves as previously hypothesized. In light of
   this new evidence, conservation programmes should account for both the
   lemur and its associated flora. Overall, this study demonstrates the
   unique potential of museum collections to study the nutritional ecology
   of threatened animals and their potential role in supporting
   conservation.},

   28,000 lemurs between 2010 and 2013. Only one study has examined this
   trade and did so using in-person interviews in northern Madagascar. The
   current study sought to expand this existing dataset and examine the
   comparability of online surveys to more traditional on-location data
   collection methods. In this study, we collected data through a web-based
   survey resulting in 302 sightings of 685 captive lemurs. We also
   collected data from 171 hotel and 43 restaurant websites and social
   media profiles. Survey submissions included sightings of 30 species from
   10 genera, nearly twice as many species as identified via the in-person
   interviews. Lemur catta, Varecia variegata, and Eulemur fulvus were the
   most common species sighted in captivity. Captive lemurs were reported
   in 19 of Madagascar's 22 administrative regions and most were seen in
   urban areas near their habitat ranges. This represents a wider
   geographic distribution of captive lemurs than previously found through
   in-person interviews. The online survey results were broadly similar to
   those of the in-person surveys though greater in species and geographic
   diversity demonstrating advantages to the use of online surveys. The
   online research methods were low in cost (USD \$100) compared to
   on-location data collection (USD \$12,000). Identified disadvantages
   included sample bias; most of the respondents to the online survey were
   researchers and many captive sightings were near study sites. The
   results illustrate the benefits of incorporating a social science
   approach using online surveys as a complement to traditional fieldwork.

Title = {Does positive reinforcement training affect the behaviour and welfare of
   zoo animals? The case of the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta)},

Abstract = {Positive reinforcement training (PRT) is an established tool to
   facilitate animal husbandry, care and research in modern zoos, with
   potential positive implications for captive animal welfare. The study
   explored the role of an isolation PRT training programme on the
   well-being of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). Eleven subjects were
   observed during an isolation training protocol to induce the animals to
   enter an area (training area) calmly and retrieve rewards separated from
   group members. Duration of individual and social behaviours were
   collected over two different periods: the baseline period, before the
   beginning of the isolation training protocol and the training period, in
   which the collection of the data started at the end of the isolation
   training sessions. Additionally, behavioural data within the isolation
   training sessions (latency to enter the training area and retrieve the
   reward, display of stress-related behaviours) were recorded. Outside the
   training sessions, lemurs were out of sight significantly more in the
   baseline (Mean SD: 15.46 +/- 5.20) than in the training (Mean SD: 4.36
   +/- 2.89) period. Social behaviour was performed significantly more in
   the training (Mean SD: 31.80 +/- 12.34) than in the baseline (Mean SD:
   12.52 +/- 5.14) period; particularly, lemurs were in social contact
   significantly more in the training (Mean SD: 14.09 +/- 6.00) than in the
   baseline period (Mean SD: 4.58 +/- 2.73). Agonistic behaviours were
   performed significantly more in the baseline (Mean SD: 0.23 +/- 0.15)
   than in the training (Mean SD: 0.07 +/- 0.07) period. Within the
   training sessions, all the individuals entered the training area, were
   isolated from conspecifics, and retrieved the reward in 6 out of 9
   sessions. Our findings show that, during the PRT period, lemurs
   displayed their natural behaviour in their everyday social life with
   significant increase of their affiliative behaviours and decrease of
   aggressive behaviours with benefits for their welfare status. Thus,
   lemurs were able to cope with the use of PRT to isolate each individual
   from its social group- a situation which, without training, might be
   very stressful. In conclusion, PRT may play a crucial role for the
   captive management of ring-tailed lemurs in captive facilities,
   including zoos.},

Abstract = {The ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) is a group-living strepsirhine
   primate endemic to Madagascar that has a complex vocal repertoire
   including affiliative moan and hmm calls. Past research has suggested
   that both vocalisations may be contact calls, and we assessed their
   usage in addition to examining the effect of individual differences and
   social factors on male calling behaviour. We tested three hypotheses:
   the group cohesion, preferred companion and individual differences
   hypotheses. From March to July 2010, 565h of focal animal data were
   collected on 31 males aged 1year at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve,
   Madagascar. Focal males were observed for 30min, with vocalisations,
   allogrooming and agonistic interactions noted using one-zero sampling,
   and general behaviour, nearest neighbour identity and distance noted
   using instantaneous point sampling, all at 2.5min intervals. We found
   support for the group cohesion hypothesis for both vocalisations, and
   support for the preferred companion and individual differences
   hypotheses for the hmm but not the moan vocalisation. Moan and hmm calls
   maintained the distance between a male and his nearest neighbour, and
   were made at higher rates during behaviours which may lead to separation
   from conspecifics, such as travel and vigilance. Males made hmm calls at
   higher rates when they were low-ranking, and/or when the nearest
   neighbour of a male or a preferred companion of either sex. Low-ranking
   males may hmm call to maintain proximity to specific individuals within
   social groups who will show them increased tolerance, with the hmm
   signalling peaceful intent. Ring-tailed lemurs are one of the best
   living models of gregarious primate ancestors, and gaining a better
   knowledge of the function and range of usage of their contact calls
   informs our understanding of the evolution of primate cognition.},

Title = {High reproductive effort is associated with decreasing mortality late in

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {79},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Evolutionary theories of senescence predict that a high allocation to
   reproduction during early life should have long-term deleterious
   consequences on future reproduction or survival because individuals have
   to face an energy allocation trade-off between reproductive effort and
   the maintenance of body condition. Using a high-quality dataset from
   1,721 red ruffed lemurs (RRL, Varecia rubra) and 3,637 black and white
   ruffed lemurs (BWRM, V. variegata) living in captivity, we tested the
   existence of a trade-off between reproductive effort and late-life
   survival after accounting for possible confounding effects of natal
   environmental conditions. We report clear evidence of actuarial
   senescence (i.e., the decline of annual survival with increasing age) in
   both sexes and for both species of ruffed lemurs. RRL had a lower
   baseline mortality and senesced faster than BWRL, resulting in similar
   distributions of longevities for both species. No between-sex difference
   was observed in any species. Lastly, a higher reproductive effort was
   positively associated with an increase of survival late in life, and
   thereby an increased longevity. These findings indicate that individual
   quality rather than trade-off drives the association between
   reproductive success and survival pattern among individual lemurs of
   both species in the protected environment provided by zoos. Lemurs are
   among the world's highest conservation priorities and better
   understanding factors influencing their longevity and actuarial
   senescence patterns should improve their conservation.},

Abstract = {Vocal individuality is widespread in social animals. Individual
   variation in vocalizations is a prerequisite for discriminating among
   conspecifics and may have facilitated the evolution of large complex
   societies. Ring-tailed lemurs Lemur catta live in relatively large
   social groups, have conspicuous vocal repertoires, and their
   species-specific utterances can be interpreted in light of source-filter
   theory of vocal production. Indeed, their utterances allow individual
   discrimination and even recognition thanks to the resonance frequencies
   of the vocal tract. The purpose of this study is to determine which
   distinctive vocal features can be derived from the morphology of the
   upper vocal tract. To accomplish this, we built computational models
   derived from anatomical measurements collected on lemur cadavers and
   compared the results with the spectrographic output of vocalizations
   recorded from ex situ live individuals. Our results demonstrate that the
   morphological variation of the ring-tailed lemur vocal tract explains
   individual distinctiveness of their species-specific utterances. We also
   provide further evidence that vocal tract modeling is a powerful tool
   for studying the vocal output of non-human primates.},

Abstract = {Naturally occurring mammary tumours are uncommon in prosimians. A
   20-year-old female ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) developed bilateral
   enlargement of the mammary glands. Surgical removal revealed that both
   masses were comprised of multiple nodules and cystic areas that entirely
   replaced the normal glands. Histologically, a benign neoplastic biphasic
   cellular proliferation, composed of luminal epithelial and basal
   myoepithelial components, was identified. Immunohistochemical analysis
   for expression of cytokeratin (CK) AE1 /AE3, CK7, CK5 + 8, CK14,
   vimentin, p63 and 14-3-3 sigma highlighted the biphasic nature of the
   neoplasm. A low mitotic count, low Ki67 labelling index, expression of
   oestrogen receptor-alpha, lack of expression of human epidermal growth
   factor receptor and a 3-year disease-free period without recurrence
   supported the benign nature of the tumour. Macroscopically,
   histologically and immunohistochemically this neoplasm resembled benign
   adenomyoepithelioma of the breast in women. This is the first complete
   report of a naturally occurring mammary tumour in a ring-tailed lemur.

Abstract = {Here we describe fatal pulmonary cysticercosis caused by Cysticercus
   longicollis, the larval stage of Taenia crassiceps in a 15-year-old
   female ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) from Sarajevo Zoo. After sudden
   death, the lemur was subjected to necropsy and large multicystic
   structure, subdivided with fibrous septa and filled with numerous
   translucent, oval to ellipsoid bladder-like cysts (cysticerci), almost
   completely replacing right lung lobe was observed. In addition, numerous
   free and encysted cysticerci were found in the thoracic cavity.
   Histopathology revealed connective tissue outlined cavities that
   compress lung parenchyma. Each cavity contained several thin walled
   cysticerci with single inverted protoscolex, one or more suckers and
   rostelum with two rows of hooks. In many of the cysticerci one or
   several exogenous buds of daughter cysticerci were observed. Based on
   morphology and microscopic appearance the parasite was identified as C.
   longicollis. Subsequent molecular analysis and sequencing confirmed
   presumptive diagnosis. To our knowledge, this case represents the first
   report of T. crassiceps and cysticercosis caused by C. longicollis in
   Bosnia and Herzegovina.},

Abstract = {The effect of the zoo environment on captive animals is an increasingly
   studied area of zoo research, with visitor effects and exhibit design
   recognized as two of the factors that can contribute to animal welfare
   in captivity. It is known that in some situations, visitors may be
   stressful to zoo-housed primates, and this may be compounded by
   environmental factors such as the weather, the time of day, and zoo
   husbandry routines. Exhibit design and proximity of the public are also
   known to influence behavioral response of primates to visitors; however,
   there is minimal research on free-ranging zoo animals, even though they
   are potentially subjected to intense interactions with visitors. The
   current study explores the effect of the zoo environment, several
   visitor variables and specific animal-visitor interactions on the
   behavior of free-ranging ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) at Fota
   Wildlife Park, Ireland. Data were obtained through scan samples
   collected over 18 months (n=12,263) and analyzed using a range of
   statistical tests, including general estimating equations (GEE). Results
   demonstrate that the free-ranging lemurs' behavior at Fota Wildlife Park
   is affected by season, weather and time of day. Similarities in feeding
   behavior exist between the free-ranging group and lemurs in the wild
   when resources are plentiful. Visitor variables had a limited effect on
   lemur behavior and behavioral diversity level. Lemurs rarely reacted to
   visitors when specific interactions were considered. Generally, the
   results indicate that the ring-tailed lemurs in this study have adapted
   well to the zoo environment and habituated to visitors.},

Title = {Huddling is more important than rest site selection for thermoregulation
   in southern bamboo lemurs},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {127},
Pages = {153-161},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Resting site selection can have important effects on the behaviour and
   fitness of organisms. The maintenance of optimal body temperatures (T-b)
   when faced with environmental variables has often been attributed to
   either specific microhabitat rest site characteristics or to behavioural
   strategies. Among many small group-living endotherms, social
   thermoregulation (i.e. huddling) is utilized as an energy conservation
   mechanism at low ambient temperatures (T-a), thus decreasing the
   metabolic cost of maintaining Tb. Although unusual among primates,
   lemurs maintain a low metabolic rate and exhibit a diversity of
   thermoregulatory strategies; however, objective Tb measurements have
   thus far been limited to small-bodied lemurs (e.g. Cheirogaleids). As
   such, we sought to determine whether a medium-sized lemur model, the
   southern bamboo lemur, Hapalemur meridionalis, would maintain
   thermoregulation through microhabitat rest site selection, huddling
   behaviour, or potentially both strategies. Within a degraded littoral
   forest fragment in southeast Madagascar, we conducted full-day focal
   observations on three groups of H. meridionalis between January and
   December 2013. Adult individuals were collared with data-loggers that
   collected instantaneous skin temperature T-sk (degrees C). We calculated
   the mean Tsk of the focal individual during each resting bout, and the
   proportional rate of huddling between the focal individual and
   conspecifics. In addition, we recorded all resting sites utilized for at
   least 15 min and collected standard tree characteristics. We fitted
   linear mixed-effects models to determine the thermoregulatory combined
   effect of specific resting site characteristics, huddling behaviour and
   environmental variables on Tsk. Our results showed that lemurs selected
   tree sites with larger diameter at breast height; however, huddling was
   most predictive of increasing Tsk whereas resting site characteristics
   were not included in the best-fit model. It is possible that
   microhabitat rest site selection is not significant in a degraded forest
   as the potential environmental buffering is limited; thus,
   thermoregulatory mechanisms are probably best served by behavioural
   strategies, i.e. social huddling. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {Primate responses to habitat alteration vary depending on the species'
   dietary guild and forest type. Leaves from secondary vegetation can
   provide nutritious resources to folivorous primates, whereas frugivores,
   burdened with a scattered spatial and temporal distribution of fruiting
   resources, require larger home ranges, potentially limiting their
   ability to cope with altered landscapes. Within coastal southeastern
   Madagascar, we sought to determine whether two lemur species occupying
   contrasting ecological niches respond differently to the changing
   features of their degraded and fragmented habitat. We conducted
   behavioral observations between 2011 and 2013 on frugivorous collared
   brown lemurs (Eulemur collaris) and folivorous southern bamboo lemurs
   (Hapalemur meridionalis). To estimate the ability of lemurs to use
   pioneer species, we categorized all plants used for feeding and resting
   as fast growing, mid-growing, or slow growing. We fitted general linear
   mixed-effects models, one for each plant growth category with monthly
   proportional use rates as the dependent variable, and included species
   (E. collaris and H. meridionalis), activity (feeding and resting), and
   season (dry and wet) as fixed effects. Our results show that E. collaris
   used both slow- and mid-growing plant species most often, while H.
   meridionalis were more likely to use fast-growing plants, which
   indicated an ability to use secondary/disturbed vegetation. Frugivorous
   E. collaris appear more limited by climax plants, while folivorous H.
   meridionalis appear to be slightly more adaptable, a finding that is
   consistent with that for other primate folivores.},

   granulomatous scleritis and focal keratitis with intralesional
   cholesterol, consistent with xanthomatous inflammation. This is the
   first report of xanthomatous inflammation in a gray mouse lemur. This
   condition may be the result of systemic factors (lipid metabolism
   disorders) and/or local predisposing factors such as hemorrhage or
   inflammation. The pathogenesis in this case could not be fully
   determined. Further studies on lemurs are required for a better
   understanding of their lipid metabolism, as well as for diagnosing and
   evaluating the incidence of xanthomatous inflammation in these species.},

Abstract = {The live capture of primates is occurring throughout the tropics and can
   be a threat to their conservation. Primates are owned as pets for a
   variety of reasons. Studies of the motivations for primate ownership
   have been conducted in several countries where they are endemic, but no
   study has examined this issue in Madagascar. Madagascar is home to the
   highest number of threatened primate taxa in any one country, and an
   estimated 28,000 lemurs were kept in illegal captivity from 2010 to
   mid-2013. We aimed to expand knowledge about the motivations of lemur
   ownership in Madagascar. Data were collected via a web-based survey (n =
   229 respondents) and from the websites and social media pages of 25
   hotels. We found that many lemurs (45\%) were seen on the premises of a
   business or in a private home (27\%). Many lemurs were perceived to be
   kept as personal pets (37\%) or for money-making or tourism purposes
   (20\%). When lemurs were used for money-making, owners could receive
   indirect (72\% of the time) and direct benefits (28\%). Hotels showing
   photographs of captive lemurs on their websites and social media sites
   charged USD 25.69 more per night for a standard room than hotels that
   did not show such photographs. We found little evidence that captive
   lemurs are kept as a social status symbol, for captive breeding, or as a
   fallback food. These findings provide evidence that the motivations for
   the ownership of, usually illegal, captive lemurs is typically linked
   with money-making or with the desire to have a lemur as a pet. These
   data can help target new outreach programs.},

Abstract = {We describe the development of neurological signs in four juvenile
   black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegate), housed at a petting
   zoo in Japan. The clinical course was severe, with three lemurs dying
   within 1 day of the appearance of clinical signs. The other lemur was
   treated and survived. Pathological analyses demonstrated meningitis and
   the presence of gram-negative bacilli in the cerebrum, cerebellum,
   palatine tonsil and liver. Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from the
   brain of all of the dead lemurs. Multilocus sequence typing analysis
   showed that all the isolates were sequence type 86 (ST86). To our
   knowledge, this is the first determination of K. pneumoniae infection in
   ruffed lemurs of this genus. K. pneumoniae infection may represent a
   risk to lemurs and people who come into contact with infected animals.

Abstract = {In previous research we designed an interferometric quantum seismograph
   that uses entangled photon states to enhance sensitivity in an
   optomechanic device. However, a spatially-distributed array of such
   sensors, with each sensor measuring only nm-vibrations, may not provide
   sufficient sensitivity for the prediction of major earthquakes because
   it fails to exploit potentially critical phase information. We
   conjecture that relative phase information can explain the anecdotal
   observations that animals such as lemurs exhibit sensitivity to
   impending earthquakes earlier than can be done confidently with
   traditional seismic technology. More specifically, we propose that
   lemurs use their limbs as ground motion sensors and that relative phase
   differences are fused in the brain in a manner similar to a phased-array
   or synthetic-aperture radar. In this paper we will describe a
   lemur-inspired quantum sensor network for early warning of earthquakes.
   The system uses 4 interferometric quantum seismographs (e.g., analogous
   to a lemurs limbs) and then conducts phase and data fusion of the
   seismic information. Although we discuss a quantum-based technology, the
   principles described can also be applied to classical sensor arrays.},

Title = {Effects of human disturbance on the mongoose lemur Eulemur mongoz in

   Endangered species},

Abstract = {The decline of the mongoose lemur Eulemur mongoz has resulted in a
   change of its conservation status from Vulnerable to Critically
   Endangered. Assessing the current threats to the species and the
   attitudes of the people coexisting with it is fundamental to
   understanding whether and how human impacts may affect populations. A
   questionnaire-based analysis was used to study the impact of agriculture
   and other subsistence activities, and local educational initiatives, on
   lemur abundance, group size and composition in the Comoros. On the
   islands of Moh4li and Anjouan we recorded 214 lemurs in 63 groups, the
   size and composition of which depended both on environmental parameters
   and the magnitude and type of anthropogenic pressure. There was no
   evidence of an impact of anthropogenic disturbance on abundance. In
   contrast, group size and composition were sensitive to human impacts.
   The most important threats were conflicts related to crop raiding, as
   well as illegal capture and hunting. The promotion of educational
   activities reduced the negative impact of hunting and illegal
   activities. These results highlight a need for urgent conservation
   measures to protect the species.},

Abstract = {Conservation planning is important to protect species from going extinct
   now that natural habitats are decreasing owing to human activity and
   climate change. However, there is considerable controversy in choosing
   appropriate metrics to weigh the value of species and geographic
   regions. For example, the added value of phylogenetic
   conservation-selection criteria remains disputed because high
   correlations between them and the nonphylogenetic criteria of species
   richness have been reported. We evaluated the commonly used conservation
   metrics species richness, endemism, phylogenetic diversity (PD), and
   phylogenetic endemism (PE) in a case study on lemurs of Madagascar. This
   enabled us to identify the conservation target of each metric and
   consider how they may be used in future conservation planning. We also
   devised a novel metric that uses a phylogeny scaled according to the
   rate of phenotypic evolution as a proxy for a species' ability to adapt
   to change. High rates of evolution may indicate generalization or
   specialization. Both specialization and low rates of evolution may
   result in an inability to adapt to changing environments. We examined
   conservation priorities by using the inverse of the rate of body mass
   evolution to account for species with low rates of evolution. In line
   with previous work, we found high correlations among species richness
   and PD (r = 0.96), and endemism and PE (r = 0.82) in Malagasy lemurs.
   Phylogenetic endemism in combination with rates of evolution and their
   inverse prioritized grid cells containing highly endemic and specialized
   lemurs at risk of extinction, such as Avahi occidentalis and Lepilemur
   edwardsi, 2 endangered lemurs with high rates of phenotypic evolution
   and low-quality diets, and Hapalemur aureus, a critically endangered
   species with a low rate of body mass evolution and a diet consisting of
   very high doses of cyanide.},

   homeostasis, increasing digestive efficiency, and facilitating the
   development of the immune system. The composition of the gut microbiota
   can change dramatically within and between individuals of a species as a
   result of diet, age, or habitat. Therefore, understanding the factors
   determining gut microbiota diversity and composition can contribute to
   our knowledge of host ecology as well as to conservation efforts. Here
   we use high-throughput sequencing to describe variation in the gut
   microbiota of the endangered ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) at the Beza
   Mahafaly Special Reserve (BMSR) in southwestern Madagascar.
   Specifically, we measured the diversity and composition of the gut
   microbiota in relation to social group, age, sex, tooth wear and loss,
   and habitat disturbance. While we found no significant variation in the
   diversity of the ring-tailed lemur gut microbiota in response to any
   variable tested, the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota was
   influenced by social group, age, and habitat disturbance. However,
   effect sizes were small and appear to be driven by the presence or
   absence of relatively low abundance taxa. These results suggest that
   habitat disturbance may not impact the lemur gut microbiota as strongly
   as it impacts the gut microbiota of other primate species, highlighting
   the importance of distinct host ecological and physiological factors on
   host-gut microbe relationships. Am. J. Primatol. 78:883-892, 2016. (c)

Abstract = {Assessing manual lateralization in non-human primates could be an
   optimal way to understand the adaptive value of this asymmetry in
   humans. Though many studies have investigated hand preferences in Old
   and New World monkeys and apes, fewer studies have considered manual
   lateralization in strepsirrhines, especially in experimental tasks. This
   study investigated hand preferences for a unimanual and a bimanual task
   of 17 captive ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta), housed at Parco Natura
   Viva (VR), Italy. The effect of age on handedness has been also
   investigated. The lemurs were tested on a unimanual task, in which
   subjects were restricted to using one hand to retrieve the food inside
   an apparatus, and on a bimanual task, in which lemurs had to use one
   hand to keep the apparatus door open while reaching with the other hand
   to retrieve the food inside it. At the population-level, our results
   revealed an asymmetrical hand use distribution, in particular a bias
   toward a right hand preference for food reaching in both the unimanual
   and the bimanual tasks. Furthermore, at the individual-level, the
   bimanual task seems to elicit a greater hand preference than the
   unimanual task. Results of this study underline the importance of
   experimental tasks in determining hand preference in strepsirrhines.
   Furthermore, as bimanual tasks elicited a stronger degree of
   lateralization, they appear to be more suited to investigate manual
   laterality. Finally, findings from this study highlight the presence of
   a right hand preference in ring-tailed lemurs, shedding new light on the
   evolution of human right handedness. Am. J. Primatol. 78:851-860, 2016.

Title = {Behavioral Thermoregulation in Lemur catta: The Significance of Sunning
   and Huddling Behaviors},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {78},
Number = {7},
Pages = {745-754},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Regulation of body temperature poses significant problems for organisms
   that inhabit environments with extreme and seasonally fluctuating
   ambient temperatures. To help alleviate the energetic costs of autonomic
   responses, these organisms often thermoregulate through behavioral
   mechanisms. Among primates, lemurs in Madagascar experience
   uncharacteristically seasonal and unpredictable climates relative to
   other primate-rich regions. Malagasy primates are physiologically
   flexible, but different species use different mechanisms to influence
   their body temperatures. Lemur catta, the ring-tailed lemur, experiences
   particularly acute diurnal temperature fluctuations in its mostly
   open-canopy habitat in south and southwest Madagascar. Ring-tailed
   lemurs are also atypical among lemurs in that they appear to use both
   sun basking postures and huddling to maintain body temperature when
   ambient temperatures are cold. To our knowledge, however, no one has
   systematically tested whether these behaviors function in
   thermoregulation. We present evidence that ring-tailed lemurs use these
   postures as behavioral thermoregulation strategies, and that different
   environmental variables are associated with the use of each posture.
   Major predictors of sunning included ambient temperature, time of day,
   and season. Specifically, L. catta consistently assumed sunning postures
   early after daybreak when ambient temperatures were <13 degrees C, and
   ceased sunning around 10:00a.m., after ambient temperatures approached
   26 degrees C. Sunning occurred more often during austral winter months.
   Huddling was associated with time of day, but not with ambient
   temperature or season. We conclude that L. catta tend to sun, rather
   than huddle, under cold weather conditions when sunning is possible.
   However, both sunning and huddling are important behavioral adaptations
   ofL. catta that augment chemical thermoregulation and the absence of a
   dynamic, insulating pelage. Sunning and huddling help to account for the
   great ecological flexibility of the species, but these adaptations may
   be insufficient in the face of future changes in protective vegetation
   and temperature. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   RING-TAILED LEMURS (LEMUR CATTA)},

Abstract = {The ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) is primarily distributed in south
   and southwestern Madagascar. It is classified as an endangered species
   by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Various abdominal
   diseases, such as hepatic lipidosis, intestinal ulcers, cystitis,
   urinary tract obstruction, and neoplasia (e.g., colonic adenocarcinoma
   and cholangiocarcinoma), have been reported in this species. The aim of
   this study was to describe the normal radiographic and ultrasonographic
   abdominal anatomy in captive ring-tailed lemurs to provide guidance for
   clinical use. Radiography of the abdomen and ultrasonography of the
   liver, spleen, kidneys, and urinary bladder were performed in 13 and 9
   healthy captive ring-tailed lemurs, respectively, during their annual
   health examinations. Normal radiographic and ultrasonographic reference
   ranges for abdominal organs were established and ratios were calculated.
   The majority (12/13) of animals had seven lumbar vertebrae. The sacrum
   had mainly (12/13) three segments. Abdominal serosal detail was
   excellent in all animals, and hypaxial muscles were conspicuous in the
   majority (11/13) of animals. The spleen was frequently (12/13) seen on
   the ventrodorsal (VD) view and rarely (3/13) on the right lateral (RL)
   view. The liver was less prominent and well contained within the
   ribcage. The pylorus was mostly (11/13) located to the right of the
   midline. The right and left kidneys were visible on the RL and VD views,
   with the right kidney positioned more cranial and dorsal to the left
   kidney. On ultrasonography, the kidneys appeared ovoid on transverse and
   longitudinal views. The medulla was hypoechoic to the renal cortex. The
   renal cortex was frequently (8/9) isoechoic and rarely (1/9) hyperechoic
   to the splenic parenchyma. The liver parenchyma was hypoechoic (5/5) to
   the renal cortex. Knowledge of the normal radiographic and
   ultrasonographic abdominal anatomy of ring-tailed lemurs may be useful
   in the diagnosis of diseases and in routine health examinations.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {197},
Pages = {124-130},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The main threats to lemurs are habitat loss and hunting. Conservation
   policies often assume that people will decrease lemur hunting if they
   understand government prohibitions on hunting, are educated and/or
   involved in ecotourism, have access to affordable meat, and/or are
   healthy and financially secure. Yet these assumptions are often not well
   tested where conservation policies are implemented. We interviewed every
   member of a focal village in one of the most biodiverse places on earth,
   the Masoala peninsula of Madagascar. The factors that best predicted the
   decision to hunt lemurs were poverty, poor health, and child
   malnutrition. Knowledge of laws, level of education, involvement in
   ecotourism, traditional cultural values, taste preferences, opportunity,
   and human-wildlife conflict had no impact on lemur hunting. Our results
   suggest that the welfare of humans and lemurs are linked. The key to
   discouraging illegal hunting and improving the viability of Endangered
   lemur populations may be improving rural human health and welfare. (C)

Title = {ESTIMATED COMPOSITION OF DIETS FED TO CAPTIVE BLACK-AND-WHITE RUFFED
   LEMURS (VARECIA VARIEGATA) AT 33 US ZOOLOGICAL INSTITUTIONS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE},

Volume = {47},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Data on captive diets for black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia
   variegata) are limited. Information on food items used, inclusion
   amounts, and the chemical composition of diets is needed to improve the
   management of nutrition-related health problems seen in captive lemurs
   (e.g., obesity) that have not been reported in their wild counterparts.
   To determine the ingredient and nutrient composition of diets for
   captive V. variegata, U.S. zoological institutions were surveyed.
   Chemical composition of reported diets was estimated using Nutritionist
   Pro(TM) (Axxya Systems, Stafford, Texas 77477, USA), and these values
   were compared numerically to wild lemur diets from the literature.
   Institutions included from six to greater than 30 different ingredients
   in their diets, including fruits (0.0-84.1\%), vegetables (7.5-70.0\%),
   greens (1.0-28.5\%), and commercially available feeds (1.5-68.6\%).
   Nutrient concentrations of captive diets ranged as follows: dry matter
   (DM), 14.5-67.6\%; organic matter, 93.1-97.2\% DM basis (DMB); crude
   protein, 7.9-23.9\% DMB; fat, 2.0-6.5\% DMB; total dietary fiber,
   10.1-28.1\% DMB; and N-free extract, 38.9-74.4\% DMB. Captive diets had
   lower fat and total dietary fiber and higher protein and N-free extract
   compared to wild fruit items from Madagascar. Reducing the amount of
   fruit in captive diets for V. variegata would be expected to decrease
   digestible carbohydrate content and increase fiber content of these
   diets, which has implications for the prevalence of obesity in captive
   animals.},

Abstract = {Cystic echinococcosis (CE) by Echinococcosis granulosus (Eg) infection
   was seen in a 13 years old male lemur, found dead in a zoo in Northern
   Italy. Necropsy revealed several transparent cysts in the lungs and in
   the abdominal cavity. Free-floating cysts of varying sizes were found in
   the peritoneal cavity, and no protoscolex was seen microscopically.
   Histologically, a multifocal severe parasitic granulomatous pneumonia
   was observed. Confirmation of E. granulosus ``sensu stricto{''} was
   reached by PCR and sequencing. In view of the absence of definitive host
   in the zoo, located in non-endemic region for CE, it is speculated that
   infection introduced through translocation of lemur from endemic region
   (Southern Italy zoo). (c) 2015 PVJ. All rights reserved},

Title = {Captive Conditions of Pet Lemurs in Madagascar},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Pages = {48-63},
Abstract = {Live extraction of wildlife is a threat to biodiversity and can
   compromise animal welfare standards. Studies of the captive environments
   and welfare of pet primates are known, but none has focused on
   Madagascar. We aimed to expand knowledge about the captive conditions of
   pet lemurs in Madagascar. We hypothesized that captive lemurs would
   often be kept in restrictive settings, including small cages, would be
   fed foods inconsistent with their natural diets and, as a result, would
   be in bad physical or psychological health. Data were collected via a
   web-based survey (n = 253 reports) and from the websites and social
   media pages of 25 hotels. Most lemurs seen by respondents were either
   kept on a rope/leash/chain or in a cage (67\%), though some lemurs were
   habituated and were not restrained (28\%). Most of the time (72\%) cages
   were considered small, and lemurs were rarely kept in captivity together
   with other lemurs (81\% of lemurs were caged alone). Pet lemurs were
   often fed foods inconsistent with their natural diets, and most (53\%)
   were described as being in bad health. These findings point to a need to
   undertake outreach to pet lemur owners in Madagascar about the captivity
   requirements of primates. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {Sebaldella termitidis is a rare fastidious microorganism of the
   Leptotrichiaceae family. A variety of closely related species are
   associated with severe and even life-threatening disease in humans and
   animals, such as Streptobacillus moniliformis, the etiological organism
   of rat-bite fever as well as members of Leptotrichia spp. and Sneathia
   sanguinegens, which have been reported from cases of septicaemia. In
   contrast, since its description some 50 years ago, S. ermitidis has so
   far never been reported as a vertebrate pathogen, nor has it been found
   aside from its natural termite host. A lesser dwarf lemur was presented
   with unilateral facial inflammation originating from rotten maxillary
   teeth and septic root abscess. Surgical intervention and root extraction
   significantly improved the clinical cause in that a pus-filled cavity
   underneath the right eye could be drained, sampled and flushed. Bacteria
   displaying substantial characteristics of S. termitidis were cultured
   from the sampled pus. Morphological features observed included strictly
   anaerobic regular Gram-negative rods. Significant shared biochemical
   properties included negative reactions for cytochrome oxidase, catalase,
   urease, nitrate reduction and indole production. Furthermore, 16S rRNA
   gene sequencing revealed 99.9 \% sequence homology to the S. termitidis
   type strain NCTC 11300(T), from which it, nevertheless, differed with
   respect to rep and rep- and RAPD-PCR profiles. An affiliation of the
   lemur isolate described in this study with the type strain of S.
   termitidis as well as a clear discrimination from other members of the
   Leptotrichiaceae could also be confirmed by matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization time-of flight mass spectrometry and Fourier
   transform-infrared spectroscopy. This is the first evidence for clinical
   disease caused by S. termitidis in a vertebrate species indicating a
   broader host spectrum of this rarely encountered microorganism.},

Title = {A preliminary investigation of sleeping site selection and sharing by
   the brown mouse lemur Microcebus rufus during the dry season},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {96},
Number = {6},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mouse lemurs (Microcebus) are solitary, experience heavy predation, and
   use torpor to conserve energy, so an individual's choice of daytime
   sleeping site can have a major impact on its fitness. Sharing a sleeping
   site may strengthen social bonds or insulate against fluctuating ambient
   temperatures. Changing sites often may prevent tracking by predators.
   Choosing a site in a hole in an old, thick tree may allow for longer and
   deeper torpor. The aim of this paper is to provide a preliminary
   characterization of sleeping site selection and use in Microcebus rufus,
   the brown mouse lemur. We trapped mouse lemurs in disturbed forests in
   the peripheral zone of Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, and tracked
   7 individuals using temperature-sensitive radiocollars. Radiotracked
   individuals shared sleeping sites concurrently and serially and slept in
   same-sex and mixed-sex groups. They slept in tree holes as well as in
   piles of leaves on branches. Radiotracked individuals tended to use
   higher-diameter at breast height trees, and in one site, tall trees were
   also used more often. Preference for and reuse of well-insulated
   sleeping sites suggests that thermoregulation is a primary concern for
   winter sleeping site selection in M. rufus. If such sites are of limited
   availability in disturbed sites, the ability for M. rufus to maintain
   torpor during the winter may also be limited. Conservation efforts must
   include preservation of older trees in order to maintain
   thermoregulatory refuges in disturbed habitats that support lasting
   mouse lemur populations.},

Abstract = {A mature male, black and white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata
   variegata) died in a zoological garden after a 4-day history of lethargy
   and non-responsive convulsions. Necropsy and histopathological
   examinations revealed acute necrotizing and haemorrhagic
   meningoencephalitis with intralesional amoebas confirmed by
   immunohistochemistry. Acanthamoeba T4 genotype was identified as the
   causative agent of the brain lesion, based on amplification and
   sequencing of 18S ribosomal RNA genes. The presence of free-living
   amoebas in water and mud from the lemur's environment was investigated
   by morphological and molecular analyses. The two predominant genera,
   representing 80\% of isolated amoebas, were Naegleria spp. and
   Acanthamoeba spp. All Acanthamoeba isolates belonged to the T4 genotype.
   To the author's knowledge, this is the first report of a
   meningoencephalitis due to Acanthamoeba T4 genotype in Lemuridae with
   concurrent analysis of pathological tissues and environment. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Animal reliance on fruit signals, such as hardness, colour, and odour,
   during foraging is poorly understood. Here, we present data on fruit
   foraging behaviour and efficiency (rate of fruit ingestion) of three
   groups of wild, frugivorous brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus, N = 29
   individuals) in Ankarafantsika National Park, Madagascar. We quantify
   fruit hardness using a modified force gauge, fruit colour using
   spectroscopy, and fruit odour using volatile organic compound (VOC)
   sampling with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We relate lemur
   foraging behaviour to fruit traits by calculating touching, visual
   inspection, and sniffing indices and relate lemur foraging efficiency to
   fruit traits by calculating acceptance indices. The use of different
   sensory modalities by lemurs is marginally predicted in one case by
   fruit traits-fruits with higher overall smell signals are sniffed less
   than fruits with lower overall smell signals. When controlling for all
   fruit traits, fruit size is the only significant predictor of fruit
   foraging efficiency-lemurs forage more rapidly on smaller fruits
   relative to larger fruits.},

Abstract = {Yawning, although easily recognized, is difficult to explain.
   Traditional explanations stressed physiological mechanisms, but more
   recently, behavioral processes have received increasing attention. This
   is the first study to test a range of hypotheses on yawning in wild
   primate populations. We studied two sympatric strepsirrhine species,
   Lemur catta, and Propithecus verreauxi, of the Ankoba forest (24.99
   degrees S, 46.29 degrees E, Berenty reserve) in southern Madagascar.
   Sexual dimorphism is lacking in both species. However, their differences
   in ecological and behavioral characteristics facilitate comparative
   tests of hypotheses on yawning. Our results show that within each
   species males and females yawned with similar frequencies supporting the
   Dimorphism Hypothesis, which predicts that low sexual dimorphism leads
   to little inter-sexual differences in yawning. In support of the State
   Changing Hypothesis yawning frequencies was linked to the sleep-wake
   cycle and punctuated transitions from one behavior to another.
   Accordingly, yawning frequencies were significantly higher in L. catta
   than in P. verreauxi, because L. catta has a higher basal level of
   activity and consequently a higher number of behavioral transitions. In
   agreement with the Anxiety Hypothesis, yawning increased significantly
   in the 10 min following predatory attacks or aggression. Our findings
   provide the first empirical evidence of a direct connection between
   anxiety and yawning in lemurs. Our results show that yawning in these
   two strepsirrhines occurs in different contexts, but more research will
   be necessary to determine if yawns are a single, unitary behavior. (C)

Abstract = {All habitats of Madagascar go through a dry season from April to
   September each year, resulting in a period of fruit scarcity lasting up
   to 6 months and creating selection pressure for adaptation to
   fluctuations in resources. Some Cheirogaleid lemurs, including mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus), use daily torpor and long-term hibernation during
   this period, saving energy through inactivity. Capture-recapture studies
   in some mouse lemur populations have suggested a pattern of biased sex
   ratio throughout the winter as a result of females hibernating while
   most males remain active. We studied winter activity in a captive
   population of Microcebus lehilahytsara, Goodman's mouse lemur, in a
   large enclosure at Zoo Zurich, Switzerland using capture-recapture
   methods to determine how this behavior varies with sex and age, and what
   this pattern suggests about the ultimate cause of torpor use in this
   clade. Our results suggest that Goodman's mouse lemurs use torpor to
   avoid seasonal food shortage, even though they experience less extreme
   seasonal variability of food availability than western dry forest mouse
   lemurs. Male and female Goodman's mouse lemurs are equally capable of
   winter torpor, and most remaining active individuals are young that have
   not sufficiently fattened. This suggests that the ``ideal{''} winter
   behavior for both males and females is torpor, which ultimately avoids
   periods of seasonal food scarcity.},

Title = {SUMMER AND WINTER VITAMIN D-3 LEVELS IN FOUR LEMUR SPECIES HOUSED AT A
   BRITISH ZOO, WITH REFERENCE TO UVB LEVELS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {498-505},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Serum samples were collected from 18 lemurs of four diurnal/cathemeral
   species housed with outdoor access at Bristol Zoo Gardens (United
   Kingdom) to test 25-hydroxy-vitamin D-3 (25OHD(3)) levels as part of the
   veterinary department's preventative health care program. Samples were
   collected from each lemur in August 2008 (summer) and January 2009
   (winter) to examine the effect of season on 25OHD(3) levels. The lemurs
   were fed commercial primate food and a range of fruit and vegetables,
   and dietary levels of vitamin D-3 remained the same throughout the study
   period. Statistical analysis showed that the lemurs' summer 25OHD(3)
   values (range 26.7 to >150.0 mu g/L) were significantly higher than
   their winter 25OHD(3) values (range 11.4-87.1 mu g/L). UVB measurements
   taken during the study period confirmed that UVB levels were
   significantly higher in summer (mean reading for 1200-1300 GMT time
   period 153.8 mu W/cm(2)) compared to winter (mean reading for 1200-1300
   GMT time period 19.4 mu W/cm(2)). The 25OHD(3) levels measured were
   generally found to be high compared to previously published values from
   wild (free-ranging) lemurs in Madagascar. The most likely explanation
   for this was the higher vitamin D-3 content of the captive lemurs' diet,
   as UVB levels at the zoo (latitude 518 north) are substantially lower
   than those that occur in Madagascar (latitude 128-268 south). No
   evidence of vitamin D toxicity or deficiency was found in any of the
   captive lemurs. The results indicate that vitamin D-3 levels in lemurs
   housed with outdoor access in the United Kingdom and by extension, other
   regions of similar latitude, vary with seasonal environmental UVB
   levels, in a similar way to the seasonal variations in vitamin D-3
   observed in humans living in these regions, but that vitamin D levels in
   this captive lemur population were adequate compared to wild lemur
   levels, even in winter.},

Title = {Testing the Influence of Habitat Structure and Geographic Distance on
   the Genetic Differentiation of Mouse Lemurs (Microcebus) in Madagascar},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The evolution of the high level of microendemism in Madagascar's biota
   remains poorly understood. Allopatric speciation or adaptations to local
   conditions along continuous gradients are two mechanisms that could have
   contributed to the extraordinary radiation of lemurs. Here we tested
   whether mouse lemurs (Microcebus griseorufus) occurring across three
   adjacent but distinct vegetation formations (ranging from dry forest to
   spiny bush) in southwestern Madagascar showed signs of genetic
   differentiation that could be interpreted as incipient speciation and
   adaptation to different environmental conditions using analysis of
   molecular variance and distance-based redundancy analysis. In the
   context of a mark-recapture study, mouse lemurs were captured with
   Sherman live traps set eight times for four nights per trapping session
   in standardized trapping grids in the three vegetation formations
   between October 2007 and February 2009. For genetic analyses, we used
   tissue samples from 41 female and 35 male M. griseorufus. Genetic
   differentiation between demes as estimated by amplified fragment length
   polymorphism (AFLP) data (as parental markers) and mitochondrial D-loop
   sequences (as maternally inherited markers) was more pronounced in
   philopatric females than in males, which are the dispersing sex in this
   species. In single-factor analyses, isolation-by-ecology had about the
   same statistical effect as isolation by distance, but
   isolation-by-ecology was no longer significant once isolation by
   distance was taken into account. Despite some differentiation between
   local demes, STRUCTURAMA, a Bayesian approach for inferring population
   structure from genetic data, assigned all individuals to a single
   population. Thus, we did not find evidence for incipient ecological
   speciation as a result of adaptation to the three investigated habitat
   types on a small geographic scale based on the available samples.},

Abstract = {While it is known that intestinal parasite communities vary in their

   we investigate the changes in the intestinal parasite infracommunities
   in wild-living rufous mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus) from Ranomafana
   National Park in southeastern Madagascar from 2010 to 2012. We used
   high-throughput barcoding of the 18S rRNA gene to interrogate parasite
   community structure. Our results show that in these nematode
   communities, there were two frequently occurring putative species and
   four rarer putative species. All putative species were randomly
   distributed over host individuals and they did not occur in clear
   temporal patterns. For the individuals caught in at least two different
   years, there was high turnover of putative species and high variation in
   fecal egg counts. Our study shows that while there was remarkable
   variation in infracommunities over time, the component community was
   relatively stable. Nevertheless, the patterns of prevalence varied
   substantially between years in each component community.},

Abstract = {Baylisascaris procyonis is a well-known ascaridoid nematode that causes
   larva migrans in humans and many other animal species. The North
   American raccoon (Procyon lotor) is the definitive host, which has been
   successfully introduced in the past decades to other geographical
   regions around the world. Two white-headed lemurs (Eulemuralbifrons)
   from a Zoological Park in Lugo, Spain, developed severe neurological
   signs within a brief period after being transferred from exhibit and
   placed in close contact with three captive raccoons from the same zoo.
   One lemur was euthanized due to the severity of disease progression and
   histopathology revealed granulomatous inflammation and ascaridoid larvae
   in kidneys, lung, spleen and brain. larvae were identified as B.
   procyonis larvae by real time PCR. In light of the results, the cage
   mate with similar neurological signs was put on an albendazole treatment
   regimen adapted from a human pediatric protocol. The aggressive
   anthelmintic treatment likely contributed to the arrest of clinical
   signs and recovery of some motor skills. Importantly, Baylisascaris
   procyonis infection might occur in wild raccoon populations in Spain.

Volume = {276},
Number = {6},
Pages = {649-656},

Abstract = {Most mammals have nose tips covered by glabrous skin, a labronasal area,
   or rhinarium. The surface of the rhinarium of Lemur catta has a
   dermatoglyphic pattern consisting of epidermal domes. Below the domes,
   epidermal pegs dip down into the dermis. In and below the tip of the
   epidermal peg, a complex sensory organ is found. It consists of an
   association of innervated Merkel cells, lamellate (Pacini-like) bodies
   with a central nerve, and a ring of unmyelinated nerve endings in the
   epidermis. The Merkel cells are situated basally in the epidermis and
   the lamellated bodies just below the epidermis. The unmyelinated nerve
   endings related to the organ ascend in a circle straight through the
   epidermis ending below the corneal layer. From these nerve terminals,
   horizontal spikes enter the keratinocytes. The three components occur
   together forming an organ and are innervated from a common nerve plexus.
   The morphology of the complex sensory organ of the lemur shares most
   crucial components with Eimer's organs in moles, echidna, and platypus,
   while some structures are lacking, for example, the specific central
   pillar of keratinocytes, the cuticular cap, and a central unmyelinated
   fiber. The presence of the essentials of an Eimer's organ in many
   mammals suggests that a wider definition is motivated. J. Morphol.

Abstract = {Sexual dimorphism is thought to be the result of sexual selection, food
   competition and/or niche differentiation, or simply the result of
   differential growth between the sexes. Despite the fact that sexual
   dimorphism is common among primates, lemurs are thought to be largely
   monomorphic. Yet, females of the species Microcebus are known to be
   larger than males. Here, we investigate if dimorphism in head dimensions
   is present in a colony of captive grey mouse lemurs Microcebus murinus.
   Moreover, we test whether any observed shape dimorphism is associated
   with differences in bite force between the sexes. Our results show that
   male and female grey mouse lemurs are indeed sexually dimorphic in head
   dimensions, with females having taller and wider heads than males.
   Moreover, we confirm previous observations that females are heavier than
   males. Bite force was principally determined by head dimensions and age
   in our dataset, and differed between sexes, with females biting harder
   than males. These data suggest a potential role for niche dimorphism in
   driving the observed shape and performance dimorphism as female
   reproductive output may depend upon the ability of animals to obtain
   resources that are difficult to ingest.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Nonhuman primates differ widely in various aspects of their ecology and
   are thus particularly suitable for studying the mechanisms underlying
   interspecies differences in taste perception. Therefore, we assessed
   taste preference thresholds as well as relative preferences for five
   food-associated sugars in three adult black-and-white ruffed lemurs
   (Varecia variegata variegata) using two-bottle choice tests of brief
   duration (1 min). We found that the subjects significantly preferred
   concentrations as low as 25 mM sucrose and fructose, and 50 mM glucose,
   maltose, and lactose over tap water. When given a choice between all
   binary combinations of the same five saccharides presented at equimolar
   concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 mM, respectively, the subjects
   displayed marked preferences for individual sugars in the following
   order: sucrose > fructose > glucose >= maltose >= lactose. The
   sensitivity of the black-and-white ruffed lemurs to the five saccharides
   falls into the same range as that reported in other primates. The
   pattern of relative preferences for food-associated sugars was found to
   be largely similar to that reported in platyrrhine primates and in human
   subjects, but differed from that reported in a catarrhine primate. Taken
   together, the results of the present study support the notions that the
   taste sensitivity in primates for food-associated sugars may correlate
   with phylogenetic relatedness, with body mass, and with lactose content
   in milk. Further, the results support the notion that relative
   preferences for food-associated sugars in primates, but not necessarily
   their sweettaste sensitivity, may correlate with dietary specialization.},

Title = {Agent-mediated spatial storage effect in heterogeneous habitat
   stabilizes competitive mouse lemur coexistence in Menabe Central,
   Western Madagascar},
Journal = {BMC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Background: Spatio-temporal distribution patterns of species in response
   to natural and anthropogenic drivers provide insight into the ecological
   processes that determine community composition. We investigated
   determinants of ecological structure in a species assemblage of 4
   closely related primate species of the family Cheirogaleidae (Microcebus
   berthae, Microcebus murinus, Cheirogaleus medius, Mirza coquereli) in
   western Madagascar by extensive line transect surveys across spatial and
   temporal heterogeneities with the specific goal of elucidating the
   mechanisms stabilizing competitive coexistence of the two mouse lemur
   species (Microcebus spp.).
   Results: Interspecific competition between the mouse lemurs was
   indicated by negative spatial associations in degraded habitat and by
   habitat partitioning along anthropogenic disturbance gradients during
   dry seasons with resource scarcity. In non-degraded habitat, intraguild
   predator M. coquereli, but not C. medius, was negatively associated with
   M. murinus on the population level, whereas its regional distribution
   overlapped spatially with that of M. berthae. The species' interspecific
   distribution pattern across spatial and temporal heterogeneities
   corresponded to predictions for agent-mediated coexistence and thus
   confirmed M. coquereli's stabilizing impact on the coexistence of mouse
   lemurs.
   Conclusions: Interspecific interactions contribute to ecological
   structure in this cheirogaleid assemblage and determinants vary across
   spatio-temporal heterogeneities. Coexistence of Microcebus spp. is
   stabilized by an agent-mediated spatial storage effect: M. coquereli
   creates refuges from competition for M. berthae in intact habitat,
   whereas anthropogenic environments provide M. murinus with an escape
   from resource competition and intraguild predation. Species persistence
   in the assemblage therefore depends on the conservation of habitat
   content and context that stabilizing mechanisms rely on. Our large-scale
   population level approach did not allow for considering all potential
   functional and stochastic drivers of ecological structure, a key
   limitation that accounts for the large proportion of unexplained
   variance in our models.},

Abstract = {Many factors can influence the parasite load of animal hosts, but
   integrative studies that simultaneously investigate several factors are
   still rare in many taxonomic groups. This study investigates the
   influence of host species, host population density, parasite
   transmission mode, sex, and two temporal (month, year) factors on
   gastrointestinal parasite prevalence and fecal egg counts of two endemic
   primate species from Madagascar, Microcebus ravelobensis and Microcebus
   murinus. A total of 646 fecal samples were available and analyzed from
   three dry seasons. Six different helminth egg morphotypes were found,
   and these were Subulura sp. (14.51 \% prevalence), strongyle eggs (12.95
   \%), Ascaris sp. (7.94 \%), Lemuricola sp. (0.17 \%), and two forms of
   tapeworms (Hymenolepis spp.) (1.73 and 0.69 \%). Coinfection with more
   than one egg type was observed in 21.22 \% of the samples containing
   eggs. Multivariate analyses revealed that host species and sex did
   neither explain significant variation in the prevalence and fecal egg
   counts of parasites with direct life cycles (Ascaris sp., strongyle egg
   type, Lemuricola sp.) nor of arthropod-transmitted parasites (Subulura
   sp.). However, fecal egg counts of Subulura sp. differed significantly
   between study sites, and the prevalence of Subulura sp. and of parasites
   with direct life cycles was influenced by temporal parameters, mainly by
   differences between study years and partly between months. When
   comparing the findings with the yearly and seasonal rainfall patterns in
   the area, most results are in accordance with the hypothesis of an
   increased vulnerability of the host toward infection under some sort of
   environmental challenge.},

Volume = {86},

Pages = {124-133},
Abstract = {The ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) is a group-living strepsirrhine
   primate endemic to Madagascar that faces considerable predation pressure
   from aerial and terrestrial predators. This species engages in mobbing
   and vigilance behavior in response to predators, and has referential
   alarm vocalizations. Because L. catta is female dominant, less is known
   about the alarm calls of males. We tested 3 hypotheses for male
   antipredator vocalization behavior on L. catta at the Beza Mahafaly
   Special Reserve in Madagascar: the predator confusion, group
   maintenance, and predation risk allocation hypotheses. We found support
   for 2 hypotheses. When a male L. catta made an antipredator call, other
   group members vocalized in response. Dominant males did not make alarm
   calls at higher rates than subordinate males. Predators were more
   abundant on the western side of Parcel 1, but an even greater number of
   antipredator vocalizations occurred in this area than predator abundance
   warranted. We show that male L. catta consistently participated in
   group-level antipredator vocalization usage in high-risk locations.
   Although female L. catta are known to hold the primary role in group
   defense, male L. catta are also key participants in group-wide behaviors
   that may confuse or drive away predators. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {Primate diets in captivity often differ considerably in their nutrient
   composition to those eaten by wild conspecifics. In particular, captive
   diets often contain much higher levels of sugar and other
   readily-digestible non-structural carbohydrates and much lower levels of
   fibre. This has been shown to have negative effects on captive primate
   physical health but to date there is little evidence of any effects on
   behaviour. In line with ongoing dietary improvements the diets of four
   species of lemur housed at Newquay Zoo and Paignton Zoo were changed to
   completely remove all fruit, resulting in a lower concentration of
   non-structural carbohydrate and increased fibre, to better reflect the
   composition of their wild diet. The effects of this diet change on
   behaviour of the lemurs were monitored, paying particular attention to
   possible welfare indicators: aggression, auto-grooming, foraging and
   self-directed behaviour. When fed the fruit-free diet both aggression (p
   < 0.001) and self-directed behaviour (p < 0.001) were significantly
   lower than when fed the original diet in all four lemur species. There
   was no significant effect of diet on foraging and auto-grooming. These
   results suggest that feeding a fruit-free diet for these lemur species
   has a positive effect on their psychological welfare in a zoo setting.},

   0.05 to 0.11. These data suggest that the L. catta populations within
   south-central Madagascar have not yet lost significant genetic
   variation. However, due to ongoing anthropogenic threats faced by
   ring-tailed lemurs, continued conservation and research initiatives are
   imperative for long-term viability of the species. (C) 2015 S. Karger

Abstract = {Mammalian gut microbes are invaluable to the host's metabolism, but few
   researchers have examined gut microbial dynamics under natural
   conditions in wild mammals. This study aims to help fill this knowledge
   gap with a survey of the natural variation of the gut nnicrobiome in 2
   wild lemur species, Lemur catta and Propithecus verreauxi. The wild L.
   catta were also compared to a captive population to discern the effect
   of habitat within a species. Gut microbial DNA was extracted from fecal
   samples collected in Madagascar and the Vienna Zoo and sequenced. The
   wild and captive L. catta had distinct microbial communities, likely due
   to differences in diet and development between their populations. The
   wild L. catta and P. verreauxi also had distinct gut microbiomes, due to
   a change in microbial abundance, not composition. Within each lemur
   species, there was abundant variation between individuals and from the
   dry to the wet season. The intraspecific and temporal microbial
   variation requires more investigation, with changes in diet a likely
   contributor. (C) 2015 5. Karger AG, Basel},

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {86},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {96-105},
Abstract = {The extended primate juvenile period has been linked to interactions
   between feeding ecology and sociality. However, accumulating field data
   on juvenile primates suggest variation in the linkages between foraging
   efficiency, group foraging and social behaviour. In many non-human
   primates, juvenile ability (strength, coordination and motor skills)
   does not limit foraging success. If predicted limitations in feeding are
   not found in juvenile monkeys, it is possible that the gregarious
   strepsirrhines may show foraging patterns similar to those implicated in
   the evolution of a life history where long juvenile periods are
   advantageous. To test these behavioural predictions, I present a mixed
   longitudinal sample of observations on feeding and foraging behaviour
   from ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) at the Reza Mahafaly Special
   Reserve, Madagascar. Like several platyrrhine species, close proximity
   during foraging, low feeding efficiency and low dietary diversity are
   not typical of ring-tailed lemurs. The lack of ecological trade-offs in
   these species may indicate stronger common roles of sociality and social
   complexity in structuring the elongation of the primate juvenile period.

Title = {Genetic Evidence for Male and Female Dispersal in Wild Lemur catta},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {86},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {66-75},
Abstract = {Lemur catta has traditionally been considered a species with male-biased
   dispersal; however, occasional female dispersal occurs. Using molecular
   data, we evaluated dispersal patterns in 2 L. catta populations in
   southwestern Madagascar: Tsinnanampesotse National Park (TNP) and Beza
   Mahafaly Special Reserve (BMSR). We also investigated the genetic
   differentiation between the populations and dispersal partner
   relatedness. Results showed minor genetic differentiation between the
   populations (theta(ST) = 0.039), which may indicate gene flow
   historically occurring in this region, made possible by the presence of
   L. catta groups between the sites. Different patterns of sex-biased
   dispersal were found between the sites using corrected assignment
   indices: male-biased dispersal in TNP, and a lack of sex-biased
   dispersal in BMSR. Observational evidence of female dispersal in BMSR
   supports these results and may imply intense female resource competition
   in and around BMSR, because small groups of 2-3 females have been
   observed dispersing within BMSR and entering the reserve from outside.
   These dispersing groups largely consisted of mothers transferring with
   daughters, although we have an aunt-niece pair transferring together.
   Genetic data suggest that males also transfer with relatives. Our data
   demonstrate that dispersal partners consist of same-sexed kin for L.
   catta males and females, highlighting the importance of kin selection.

Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related
   neurodegenerative disorder. Amyloid-beta peptide (A beta) deposition in
   the brain is one of its hallmarks, and the measure of plasma A beta is
   considered to be a biomarker for anti-amyloid drug efficacy in animal
   models of AD. However, age-associated plasmatic A beta modulation in
   animal models is practically never addressed in the literature. Mouse
   lemur primates are used as a model of normal and AD-like cerebral aging.
   Here, we studied the effect of age on plasmatic A beta in 58 mouse
   lemurs aged from 1 to 10 years. A subset of animals presented high
   plasmatic A beta, and the proportion of animals with high plasmatic A
   beta was higher in aged animals as compared with young ones. Histologic
   evaluation of the brain of some of these animals was carried out to
   assess extracellular and intracellular amyloid load. In aged lemurs,
   plasmatic A beta was negatively correlated with the density of neurons
   accumulating deposits of A beta. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Pages = {5-13},
Abstract = {For over 50 years, ring-tailed lemurs have been studied continuously in
   the wild. As one of the most long-studied primate species, the length
   and breadth of their study is comparable to research on Japanese
   macaques, baboons and chimpanzees. They are also one of the most broadly
   observed of all primates, with comprehensive research conducted on their
   behaviour, biology, ecology, genetics, palaeobiology and life history.
   However, over the last decade, a new generation of lemur scholars,
   working in conjunction with researchers who have spent decades studying
   this species, have greatly enhanced our knowledge of ring-tailed lemurs.
   In addition, research on this species has expanded beyond traditional
   gallery forest habitats to now include high altitude, spiny thicket,
   rocky outcrop and anthropogenically disturbed coastal forest
   populations. The focus of this special volume is to `re-imagine' the
   `flagship species of Madagascar', bringing together three generations of
   lemur scholars. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {In ring-tailed lemurs, Lemur catta, the factors modulating
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity differ between wild and
   semi-free-ranging populations. Here we assess factors modulating HPA
   activity in ring-tailed lemurs housed in a third environment: the zoo.
   First we validate an enzyme immunoassay to quantify levels of
   glucocorticoid (GC) metabolites in the faeces of L. catta. We determine
   the nature of the female-female dominance hierarchies within each group
   by computing David's scores and examining these in relation to faecal GC
   (fGC). Relationships between female age and fGC are assessed to evaluate
   potential age-related confounds. The associations between fGC, numbers
   of males in a group and reproductive status are explored. Finally, we
   investigate the value of 7 behaviours in predicting levels of fGC. The
   study revealed stable linear dominance hierarchies in females within
   each group. The number of males in a social group together with
   reproductive status, but not age, influenced fGC. The 7 behavioural
   variables accounted for 68\% of the variance in fGC. The amounts of time
   an animal spent locomoting and in the inside enclosure were both
   negative predictors of fGC. The study highlights the flexibility and
   adaptability of the HPA system in ring-tailed lemurs. (C) 2016 S. Karger

Abstract = {Purpose: We aimed to determine the expression level of serum soluble
   lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (sLMTK3) in human non-small cell lung cancer
   (NSCLC), and to examine whether the s sLMTK3 level could be used as a
   biomarker to screen primary NSCLC and to predict lung cancer
   progression. Methods: Serum levels of sLMTK3 in 67 patients with primary
   NSCLC, 28 patients with lung benign lesion, and 53 healthy volunteers
   were measured by sandwich ELISA. LMTK3 protein expression in NSCLC
   tissues and normal lung tissues was also detected by using
   immunohistochemical staining. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
   curve was selected to evaluate the sensitivity and the specificity of
   serum sLMTK3 level. Results: The mean concentration of sLMTK3 in NSCLC
   group was significantly higher than in the lung benign lesion group (P <
   0.001) and the healthy control group (P < 0.001). Higher sLMTK3 level
   was correlated with age (P = 0.013), tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage
   (P < 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001) of NSCLC. In contrast
   to the normal lung tissues, increased LMTK3 expression was found in the
   NSCLC tissues, and was mainly located on the cytoplasm and the nuclei of
   cancer cells. For separating NSCLC from control group, the corresponding
   areas under the ROC curve (AUC) were 0.947 for sLMTK3 and 0.804 for CEA.
   With cutoffs of 10.05 ng/ml for sLMTK3 and 5.0 ng/ml for CEA
   respectively, the sensitivity and the specificity of sLMTK3 and CEA
   were, 80.60\% and 97.53\%, 35.82\% and 96.30\%, respectively, indicating
   better diagnostic value of sLMTK3. Conclusions: The sLMTK3 level was
   significantly increased in human NSCLC, and could be used as a potential
   and valuable biomarker for screening primary NSCLC and for predicting
   the progression of patients with this malignancy.},

Title = {Relaxed Open Mouth as a Playful Signal In Wild Ring-Tailed Lemurs},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {76},

Abstract = {Play signals are commonly used by animals to communicate their playful
   motivation and to limit the risk that rough acts are misunderstood by
   playmates. The relaxed open mouth is the most common facial expression
   performed during play in many mammals and represents the ritualized
   version of the movement anticipating a play bite. The signaling nature
   of this expression has been proven in many haplorrhine species but never
   demonstrated in strepsirrhines. Our purpose was assessing whether, also
   in strepsirrhines, the relaxed open mouth has an actual communicative
   function. We studied wild ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta),
   characterized by highly social habits including intense playful
   interactions. They largely use playful signals, mostly performed with
   the black and white tail. The signaling function of the tail (tail play)
   has been widely demonstrated. We analyzed both tail play and the relaxed
   open mouth to verify how their distribution is affected by different
   play variables (e.g., play session symmetry, number of play mates,
   previous use of the same pattern). Indeed, ring-tailed lemurs use the
   relaxed open mouth as a communicative signal during play. Relaxed open
   mouth was more frequent during unbalanced interactions showing the
   highest asymmetry in the patterns performed by the two players
   (offensive/neutral). Compared to tail play, relaxed open mouth was more
   frequent during dyadic than polyadic interactions and, as a highly
   directional signal, it was more frequently replicated by the play mate.
   Therefore, the relaxed open mouth needs to be performed face-to-face so
   that signal detection can be optimized. Similar to previous findings in
   monkeys and apes, the relaxed open mouth in lemurs seems to be a
   ritualized signal used to engage and, perhaps, sustain playful
   interaction. Am. J. Primatol. 76:1074-1083, 2014. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {Degraded forest habitats typically show low fruit availability and
   scattered fruit tree distribution. This has been shown to force
   frugivorous primates either to move further in search of food, resulting
   in large home ranges, or to use energy saving strategies. Malagasy
   lemurs are known to face pronounced seasonality and resource
   unpredictability, which is amplified by the overall reduction in food
   availability due to the human-driven habitat disturbance on the island.
   To explore lemur flexibility to habitat disturbance, we examined the
   ranging behavior of collared brown lemurs (Eulemur collaris) in two
   differently degraded fragments of littoral forest of southeastern
   Madagascar. We collected data from February 2011 to January 2012 on two
   groups living in a degraded area and two groups living in a less
   disturbed forest. We calculated annual ranges, monthly ranges, and daily
   distance traveled. We then ran repeated measures ANOVAs using
   seasonality as dichotomous, intrasubject factor and site/group as
   intersubject nested factors. In the degraded forest, the lemurs had
   larger monthly ranges, and their annual ranges were either fragmented or
   characterized by multiple core areas. They were able to use a habitat
   mosaic that also included nonforested areas and swamps. In addition,
   they shortened their daily path length, possibly to preserve energy, and
   used different areas of their annual home ranges seasonally. Although a
   number of possible confounding factors may have been responsible for the
   observed differences between sites, our findings highlight the ranging
   flexibility of collared brown lemurs in littoral forest fragments.},

Abstract = {A case of fatal infection caused by larval forms of Taenia mortis in a
   ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) living in the Rome zoological garden is
   described. The animal, living in a semi-natural pen with other 15
   conspecific individuals and being fed with fresh fruit and vegetables,
   yoghurt and eggs, was transported to the Istituto Zooprofilattico of
   Rome for post-mortem examination. The anamnesis included, ten days
   before the death, apathy, lack of appetite, abdominal distension and
   diarrhoea. A severe exudative fibrinous-purulent peritonitis with
   numerous adhesions between the abdominal wall and the bowel loops was
   detected. After intestine removal, two free and viable, 4 cm long,
   whitish, leaf-like parasitic forms were pinpointed. Macroscopic
   examination of the two parasites allowed their identification as larval
   stages of cestodes, identified via molecular analysis as T. martis
   metacestodes. This report represents the first record of T. mortis
   infection in the host species and in a zoological garden and for the
   pathological relevance of the infection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {The treatment of gastric cancer has been unsatisfactory thus far;
   therefore, novel targets and treatment strategies are urgently required.
   Lemur tyrosine kinase (LMTK)3 is an estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha)
   modulator with a central role in endocrine resistance in breast cancer.
   Moreover, the expression and polymorphisms of LMTK3 are correlated with
   the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Since estrogen receptor (ER) is
   also expressed and plays a role in gastric cancer, we herein
   investigated the expression of the LMTK3 protein in 83 gastric cancer
   patients by tissue microarray and analyzed the correlation between LMTK3
   expression and the prognosis of gastric cancer. Our results demonstrated
   that LMTK3 was more frequently expressed in gastric cancer tissues
   compared to non-cancerous mucosa (79.5 vs. 45.8\%, respectively;
   P=0.000). The LMTK3 expression was significantly correlated with the
   depth of invasion (P=0.002) and disease stage (P=0.035). The
   Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the postoperative survival of the
   LMTK3-negative group was superior to that of the LMTK3-positive group
   (P=0.043). Moreover, the multivariate analysis identified LMTK3
   expression as an independent prognostic factor for patients with gastric
   cancer (P=0.019). These findings suggested that the expression of LMTK3
   may be a negative prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer.
   Moreover, targeting LMTK3 is a potential strategy for the treatment of
   gastric cancer, although the biological functions of LMTK3 in gastric
   cancer require further investigation.},

Title = {The development of sex differences in ring-tailed lemur feeding ecology},

Abstract = {Sex differences in feeding ecology may develop in response to
   fluctuations in physiological costs to females over their reproductive
   cycles, or to sexual size dimorphism, or function to minimize feeding
   competition within a group via resource partitioning. For most mammal
   species, it is unknown how these factors contribute to sex differences
   in feeding, or how the development of males and females reflects these
   intraspecific feeding differences. We show changes in dietary
   composition, diversity, overlap, and foraging behavior throughout
   development in ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) and test how the
   development of sex differences in feeding is related to female costs of
   reproduction and year-round resource partitioning. Sex differences in
   dietary composition were only present when females were lactating, but
   sex differences in other aspects of feeding, including dietary
   diversity, and relative time spent feeding and foraging, developed at or
   near the time of weaning. Sex difference in juveniles and subadults,
   when present, were similar to the differences found in adults. The low
   year-round dietary overlap and early differences in dietary diversity
   indicate that some resource partitioning may begin with young
   individuals and fluctuate throughout development. The major differences
   between males and females in dietary composition suggest that these
   larger changes in diet are closely tied to female reproductive state
   when females must shift their diet to meet energetic and nutritional
   requirements.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) is a quadruped arboreal
   primate primarily distributed in south and south-western Madagascar.
   This study was carried out to describe the normal radiographic thoracic
   anatomy of the ring-tailed lemur as a reference for clinical use.
   MethodsRadiography of the thorax was performed in 15 captive ring-tailed
   lemurs during their annual health examinations.
   ResultsNormal radiographic reference ranges for thoracic structures were
   established and ratios were calculated, such as the vertebral heart
   score (VHS). The mean VHS on the right lateral and dorsoventral views
   was 8.920.47 and 9.42 +/- 0.52, respectively.
   ConclusionsDifferences exist in the normal radiographic thoracic anatomy
   of primates. Knowledge of the normal radiographic thoracic anatomy of
   individual species is important and fundamental to assist in clinical
   cases and for accurate diagnosis of diseases.},

Title = {Voxel-based morphometry analyses of in vivo MRI in the aging mouse lemur
   primate},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAY 6},
Abstract = {Cerebral atrophy is one of the most widely brain alterations associated
   to aging. A clear relationship has been established between
   age-associated cognitive impairments and cerebral atrophy. The mouse
   lemur (Microcebus murinus) is a small primate used as a model of
   age-related neurodegenerative processes. It is the first non-human
   primate in which cerebral atrophy has been correlated with cognitive
   deficits. Previous studies of cerebral atrophy in this model were based
   on time consuming manual delineation or measurement of selected brain
   regions from magnetic resonance images (MRI). These measures could not
   be used to analyse regions that cannot be easily outlined such as the
   nucleus basalis of Meynert or the subiculum. In humans, morphometric
   assessment of structural changes with age is generally performed with
   automated procedures such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM). The
   objective of our work was to perform user-independent assessment of
   age-related morphological changes in the whole brain of large mouse
   lemur populations thanks to VBM. The study was based on the SPMMouse
   toolbox of SPM8 and involved thirty mouse lemurs aged from 1.9 to 11.3
   years. The automatic method revealed for the first time atrophy in
   regions where manual delineation is prohibitive (nucleus basalis of
   Meynert, subiculum, prepiriform cortex, Brodmann areas 13-16,
   hypothalamus, putamen, thalamus, corpus callosum). Some of these regions
   are described as particularly sensitive to age-associated alterations in
   humans. The method revealed also age-associated atrophy in cortical
   regions (cingulate, occipital, parietal), nucleus septalis, and the
   caudate. Manual measures performed in some of these regions were in good
   agreement with results from automatic measures. The templates generated
   in this study as well as the toolbox for SPM8 can be downloaded. These
   tools will be valuable for future evaluation of various treatments that
   are tested to modulate cerebral aging in lemurs.},

Title = {Multilocus coalescent analyses reveal the demographic history and
   speciation patterns of mouse lemur sister species},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Background: Debate continues as to whether allopatric speciation or
   peripatric speciation through a founder effect is the predominant force
   driving evolution in vertebrates. The mouse lemurs of Madagascar are a
   system in which evolution has generated a large number of species over a
   relatively recent time frame. Here, we examine speciation patterns in a
   pair of sister species of mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus and M.
   griseorufus. These two species have ranges that are disparately
   proportioned in size, with M. murinus showing a much more extensive
   range that marginally overlaps that of M. griseorufus. Given that these
   two species are sister taxa, the asymmetric but overlapping geographic
   ranges are consistent with a model of peripatric speciation. To test
   this hypothesis, we analyze DNA sequence data from four molecular
   markers using coalescent methods. If the peripatric speciation model is
   supported, we predict substantially greater genetic diversity in M.
   murinus, relative to M. griseorufus. Further, we expect a larger
   effective population size in M. murinus and in the common ancestor of
   the two species than in M. griseorufus, with a concomitant decrease in
   gene tree/species tree incongruence in the latter and weak signs of
   demographic expansion in M. murinus.
   Results: Our results reject a model of peripatric divergence. Coalescent
   effective population size estimates were similar for both extant species
   and larger than that estimated for their most recent common ancestor.
   Gene tree results show similar levels of incomplete lineage sorting
   within species with respect to the species tree, and locus-specific
   estimates of genetic diversity are concordant for both species.
   Multilocus demographic analyses suggest range expansions for M. murinus,
   with this species also experiencing more recent population declines over
   the past 160 thousand years.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that speciation occurred in allopatry from
   a common ancestor narrowly distributed throughout southwest Madagascar,
   with subsequent range expansion for M. murinus. Population decline in M.
   murinus is likely related to patterns of climate change in Madagascar
   throughout the Pleistocene, potentially exacerbated by continual
   anthropogenic perturbation. Genome-level data are needed to quantify the
   role of niche specialization and adaptation in shaping the current
   ranges of these species.},

Abstract = {Monozygotic (MZ) twinning is generally considered to be rare in species
   other than human. We inspected sex ratios in European zoo-bred
   ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta), revealing a significant excess of
   same-sex twins. Of 94 pairs, 60 (64\%) were either both males or both
   females (p = .004). Application of the Weinberg differential rule argues
   that 27\% of all twins in this species are MZ pairs. In this protected
   species, where twinning is commonplace (\~{}50\% of newborns are twins),
   the probable existence of frequent MZ twinning has ramifications for
   breeding programs aimed to maximize genetic diversity, and suggests that
   twin studies in a species other than human could have potential as a
   medical research tool.},

Title = {Opsin Genes and Visual Ecology in a Nocturnal Folivorous Lemur},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {88-107},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Primate color vision has traditionally been examined in the context of
   diurnal activity, but recent genetic and ecological studies suggest that
   color vision plays a role in nocturnal primate behavior and ecology as
   well. In this study, we united molecular analyses of cone visual pigment
   (opsin) genes with visual modeling analyses of food items to explore the
   evolution of color vision in the folivorous woolly lemur (genus Avahi).
   Previous studies have shown that leaf quality, e.g., protein content,
   leaf toughness, and protein/toughness ratio, is significantly correlated
   with green-red and blue-yellow chromatic differences, suggesting a
   potential role of color in leaf discrimination in Avahi, and,
   consequently, a potential adaptive advantage to color vision in this
   taxon. Phylogenetic selection tests determined that the strength of
   selection on the SWS1 opsin gene to retain blue-sensitive SWS cones did
   not significantly differ in Avahi compared to day-active primates.
   Genotyping of the M/LWS opsin gene in 60 individuals from nine species
   found that the 558-nm-sensitive (red-sensitive) allele is conserved
   across all Avahi. Finally, we measured spectral reflectance from five
   species of young leaves consumed by Avahi and background foliage in
   Ranomafana National Park and modeled performance of possible S and M/L
   pigment pairs for detecting these food items under different nocturnal
   illuminations (e.g. twilight, moonlight). We found that the observed
   cone pigment pair in Avahi was optimally tuned for color-based detection
   of young green leaves in all nocturnal light environments, suggesting a
   potential adaptive role of nocturnal color vision in selection for
   dichromacy in this genus.},

Title = {Edge Effects on Morphometrics and Body Mass in Two Sympatric Species of

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {85},

Pages = {277-291},
Abstract = {Edge effects are an inevitable and important consequence of forest loss
   and fragmentation. These effects include changes in species biology and
   biogeography. Here we examine variations in body mass and morphometrics
   for 2 sympatric species of mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus and M.
   ravelobensis) between edge and interior habitats in the dry deciduous
   forest at Ankarafantsika National Park. Between May and August 2012, we
   conducted mark-recapture experiments on mouse lemurs trapped along edge
   and interior forest transects within continuous forest adjacent to a
   large savannah. Of the 34 M. murinus captured during our study, 82\% (n
   = 28) were trapped in interior habitats. Conversely, 72\% (n = 47) of M.
   ravelobensis were captured in edge habitats. We found that mean body
   mass of M. murinus and M. ravelobensis did not differ between edge and
   interior habitats. However, female M. ravelobensis weighed significantly
   more in edge habitats (56.09 +/- 1.74 g) than in interior habitats
   (48.14 +/- 4.44 g). Our study provides some of the first evidence of sex
   differences in edge responses for a primate species. (C) 2015 S. Karger

Volume = {165},
Number = {11-12},

Abstract = {A 12 year old female Ring-Tailed Lemur (Lemur catta) was diagnosed with
   a type III Monteggia fracture associated with a wound on the mediodorsal
   side of the forearm. Surgical treatment included repair of the fracture
   using an intramedullary pin inserted in retrograde fashion associated
   with a capsular prosthesis made of suture attached to two periarticular
   screws, and second intention healing of the wound. Monteggia fractures
   are rare, representing 1 to 2\% of human forearm fractures. Although
   many reports of such fractures exist in the veterinary literature, their
   true prevalence is currently undocumented in all animal species.
   Surgical treatment in domestic carnivore species usually includes ulnar
   fracture repair and radio-ulnar fixation that impairs or limits
   pronation and supination. The surgical technique described in this case
   enabled good stabilisation and healing of the fracture, without
   compromising pronation and supination, which is valuable for primate
   species. To the authors' knowledge this is the first description of a
   Monteggia fracture in a lemur species.},

Journal = {ANIMAL COGNITION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-54},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Behavioural traditions have only been described for a small subset of
   species, and the factors responsible for the maintenance of traditions
   over time are unclear. Redfronted lemurs are known to learn socially but
   traditions have not been described in the wild. We conducted a social
   diffusion experiment over three experimental years with artificial
   feeding boxes that could be opened in two different ways (pushing or
   pulling a door). Six out of 14 individuals that participated in at least
   2 years exhibited a stable preference: five lemurs maintained a pull and
   one lemur a push preference, suggesting that habit formation and
   reinforcement learning may have lead to preferences over time. The
   remaining individuals exhibited fluctuating preferences and switched
   between showing a preference or no preference, but never switched
   between preferences. This instability might have been due to the low
   level of difficulty and/or the low object specificity of the task. The
   majority of lemurs additionally scrounged. Scrounging was not influenced
   by age, sex or success in manipulating the boxes. Thus, redfronted
   lemurs appear to use the two techniques flexibly but also scrounged
   opportunistically to get access to the rewards, indicating that
   traditions might be stabilized by multiple factors.},

Title = {Lemur tyrosine kinase-3 is a significant prognostic marker for patients

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY},

Volume = {7},

Pages = {1101-1107},
Abstract = {Lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3) belongs to the family of
   serine-threonine-tyrosine kinases and the aberrant expression of LMTK3
   was observed in several human malignancies. However, the association of
   LMTK3 with clinical outcomes in colorectal cancer patients is unclear.
   Thus, this present study was to evaluate the association of LMTK3
   expression level with clinicopathologic factors and prognosis of
   patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The expression level of LMTK3 in
   69 archival paraffin-embedded colorectal tumor tissue specimens was
   examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). As a result, we found that the
   LMTK3 expression level was significantly elevated in CRC tissues as
   compared with Crohn's disease or colorectal polyp tissues (P<0.0001,
   P<0.0001, respectively). Positive LMTK3 signals in the colorectal cancer
   cells were observed in about 89.9\% (62 of 69) CRC tissue specimens.
   Additionally, LMTK3 expression was significantly correlated with lymph
   node metastasis and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification (P=0.003,
   and P=0.008, respectively), but not with sex, age, tumor location,
   histological differentiation, tumor size, or depth of tumor invasion
   (all P>0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the overall
   survival rate was significantly higher in the patients with low
   expression of LMTK3 when compared with those patients with high LMTK3
   (P=0.010). Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed that LMTK3
   expression was an independent prognostic factor for CRC patients
   (P=0.047). These results suggest that LMTK3 protein could serve as a
   prognostic marker for CRC patients.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Echinococcus multilocularis is a tapeworm responsible in its larval
   stage for alveolar echinococcosis, a disease which is lethal when left
   untreated. Multivesiculated parasitic lesions in the liver were
   diagnosed at necropsy in a captive-born nutria (Myocastor coypus) and in
   a ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) which had been in a French zoo for 16
   months. Molecular analyses confirmed the diagnosis of E. multiloculans
   obtained by histological analyses. These were the first cases of
   infection by E. multilocularis reported in lemurs in Europe, and the
   first case in nutria in European enclosures. Lemurs are confirmed to be
   particularly sensitive to E. multilocularis with a massive infection. In
   both cases, the infection appears to have been contracted in the zoo
   indirectly via environmental contamination by feces from roaming foxes.
   Due to the large endemic area for E. multilocularis, the increasing
   prevalence in foxes in France, and an increase in awareness of the
   disease, other cases of infection in captive animals will probably be
   recorded in France in the coming years. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {Understanding ecological niche evolution over evolutionary timescales is
   crucial to elucidating the biogeographic history of organisms. Here, we
   used, for the first time, climate-based ecological niche models (ENMs)
   to test hypotheses about ecological divergence and speciation processes
   between sister species pairs of lemurs (genus Eulemur) in Madagascar. We
   produced ENMs for eight species, all of which had significant validation
   support. Among the four sister species pairs, we found nonequivalent
   niches between sisters, varying degrees of niche overlap in ecological
   and geographic space, and support for multiple divergence processes.
   Specifically, three sister-pair comparisons supported the null model
   that niches are no more divergent than the available background region.
   These findings are consistent with an allopatric speciation model, and
   for two sister pairs (E.collaris-E.cinereiceps and E.rufus-E.rufifrons),
   a riverine barrier has been previously proposed for driving allopatric
   speciation. However, for the fourth sister pair E.flavifrons-E.macaco,
   we found support for significant niche divergence, and consistent with
   their parapatric distribution on an ecotone and the lack of obvious
   geographic barriers, these findings most strongly support a parapatric
   model of speciation. These analyses thus suggest that various speciation
   processes have led to diversification among closely related Eulemur
   species.},

Abstract = {We examined object permanence in black-and-white-ruffed lemurs (Varecia
   variegata) at Zoo Atlanta. A series of visible and invisible
   displacement tasks with suitable controls were presented to five adult
   subjects. Subjects performed significantly above chance on all regular
   tasks, except for the double invisible displacements. Subjects failed
   visible and invisible controls. Failure on the control trials did not
   appear to be because subjects used the last box touched strategy
   (subjects did not choose the last box touched significantly more than
   expected by chance). However, a substantial percentage of choices was
   made to the last box touched by the experimenter. There was no
   significant difference between this percentage, and the percentage of
   choices made to the baited box (on both visible and invisible controls),
   which indicates that subjects were drawn to both boxes which the
   experimenter visited/touched, and thus failed the controls. Based on the
   results from the present study, we believe that there is no evidence
   that black-and-white ruffed lemurs understand visible and invisible
   tasks in the traditional object permanence battery. Am. J. Primatol.

Abstract = {A 21-yr-old female red ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra) was presented with
   swelling and disuse of the right manus. Severely displaced fractures of
   metacarpals II-V were diagnosed radiographically. The fractures were
   surgically stabilized with intramedullary Kirschner wires attached
   externally with an acrylic external fixator and a bone plate on the
   dorsal aspect of metacarpal III. The fractures of metacarpals II-V were
   predominantly healed on radiographs obtained 12 wk after surgery.
   However, diffuse disuse osteopenia and phalangeal contracture were
   present, with possible osteomyelitis. An exercise regimen of the
   affected hand was initiated due to the incomplete extension of the
   phalanges. After 4 wk of therapy, the extension of the phalanges had
   improved and the fractures appeared radiographically to be nearly
   completely healed. Although metacarpal fractures are common in nonhuman
   primates, they are reported infrequently in the literature.},

Abstract = {Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) with associated eosinophilic
   inflammation was documented in the gastric tissues of four black and
   white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata variegata). Pneumatosis cystoides
   intestinalis is an uncommon disease described in humans and
   characterized by multilocular gas-filled cystic spaces located within
   the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. These cystic spaces can occur in
   any location along the gastrointestinal tract as well as within the
   associated connective and lymphatic tissues. The exact cause of this
   disease is unknown. The four black and white ruffed lemurs described in
   this case series were captive born and had been housed in zoological
   institutions at two separate locations. Three of the four cases were
   female lemurs, and two of the affected lemurs were directly related. The
   individual disease presentations spanned a 5-yr time period. Two lemurs
   presented dead with no premonitory signs, whereas the other two lemurs
   presented with clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease and
   nonspecific signs of weakness. Gastric pneumatosis, diagnosed either
   grossly or histopathologically in each of these four lemurs, is
   described as a subset of PCI in which cystic spaces are localized to the
   stomach wall. Significant eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate was
   identified on histopathology of gastric tissues and found to be
   associated with the cystic lesions in each lemur. No classic etiology,
   such as a fungal infection or a parasitic infection, was identified as
   the cause of the eosinophilic gastritis. This case series demonstrates
   that gastric pneumatosis with associated eosinophilic gastritis may be a
   significant gastrointestinal disease in black and white ruffed lemurs.},

Abstract = {A 16-year-old male ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) was presented with
   severe cachexia and an abdominal mass. The encapsulated, multilobular
   mass replaced the right medial lobe of the liver and compressed the
   adjacent gall bladder. Multiple haemorrhages and necrotic foci were
   found within the mass. Microscopically, neoplastic cells formed cords of
   moderately pleomorphic, polygonal cells with mild to moderate anaplasia.
   Immunohistochemical markers used for diagnosis of hepatocellular
   carcinomas in man were used to characterize the neoplastic cells, which
   expressed hepatocyte-specific antigen, but not glypican-3 or polyclonal
   carcinoembryonic antigen. Gross, microscopical and immunohistochemical
   features of the tumour were most consistent with a well-differentiated
   hepatocellular carcinoma. Although this tumour is common among
   prosimians, to the authors' knowledge this is the first documented case
   in a ring-tailed lemur. Hepatocellular carcinomas have been associated
   with hepatitis virus infections and excessive hepatic iron in man;
   however, no association was established between this tumour and viral
   infection or hepatic iron storage disease in the present case. (C) 2012

Title = {First Insights into the Social Organisation of Goodman's Mouse Lemur
   (Microcebus lehilahytsara) - Testing Predictions from Socio-Ecological
   Hypotheses in the Masoala Hall of Zurich Zoo},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {84},

Pages = {32-48},
Abstract = {Following current socio-ecological hypotheses, the social organisation
   of a species is mainly determined by resource quality and distribution.
   In the case of Microcebus spp., a taxon-specific socio-ecological model
   was formulated earlier to explain their variable social organisation.
   The aim of this study was to test predictions from this model in
   Goodman's mouse lemur based on a data set from animals living in the
   semi-free colony of Zurich Zoo. During a 2-month study, we observed 5
   females and 5 males using radiotelemetry. We collected data on space use
   and social behaviour, on sleeping sites and on sleeping group
   composition. Predictions were only partly confirmed. As expected,
   Goodman's mouse lemurs were solitary foragers with an increased level of
   sociality due to crowding effects at the feeding stations. In contrast
   to the prediction, females and males formed unisexual sleeping groups,
   which were stable in females and of a fission-fusion type in males.
   Whereas the formation of sleeping groups by both sexes may be triggered
   by thermoregulatory benefits, the formation of unisexual sleeping groups
   may result from divergent interests of the sexes. We conclude that the
   existing model for the evolution of mouse lemur social organisation
   needs to be refined. Copyright (c) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {The detailed systematic morphology of the extrinsic cardiac nervous
   system (ECNS) and its surrounding structures in lemurs, Lemuriformes,
   were examined using 18 sides of nine lemurs including all four families:
   Lemuridae, Indriidae, Lepilemuridae, and Cheirogaleidae. Although the
   general morphology of ECNS in lemurs is similar to that in Lorisiformes,
   several anatomical differences, such as the structural variation of the
   cervicothoracic ganglion, the positional variation of the middle
   cervical ganglion, and the unusual appearance of the superior cardiac
   nerve originating from the superior cervical ganglion, demonstrate the
   diversity within Lemuriformes. In other words, the comparative
   anatomical findings of the wide variations in ECNS in the four families
   of Lemuriformes compared with the lower variations in the two families
   of Lorisiformes possibly reflect their evolutionary history and
   diversity, as is shown in the recent molecular phylogeny.
   On the other hand, the shared common morphology of ECNS in Lorisiformes
   and Lemuriformes is considered to be the morphology of the common
   ancestor of strepsirrhines and demonstrates the gradual evolutionary
   changes in the primate lineage.
   Our present and previous results also suggest that ECNS is preserved in
   the primate lineage without modification and specialization because of
   its functional adaptation, as is seen in the somatic system. (C) 2012

   learning strategies to develop species-typical feeding ecology, and the
   utility of these strategies may vary phylogenetically and with
   environmental stability. Focused learning from mothers and other group
   members is critical in monkeys, with behaviours such as co-feeding
   playing strong roles in determining postweaning survival. While adult
   lemurs are capable of social learning, it is unknown how social
   information is incorporated during the development of feeding or what
   social learning strategies are used in this process. Here we evaluate
   the use of social learning behaviours and the potential for social
   learning in young ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, at the Beza Mahafaly
   Special Reserve, Madagascar. We show that infant and juvenile ringtailed
   lemurs use basic and generalized stimulus enhancement that occurs
   through behavioural synchrony with older nearest neighbours. More
   focused co-feeding occurred at low levels, and many of the social
   learning behaviours observed in the other social primate taxa were
   absent. High levels of individual exploration also contributed to
   learning, evidenced through high dietary diversity in juveniles relative
   to other group members. Our observations are consistent with the idea
   that simple social learning rules are responsible for the development of
   ecological complexity in many generalist vertebrate species, and that
   more complicated learning behaviours may not be necessary to learn
   complex and varied diets. (c) 2012 The Association for the Study of

Title = {Characterization of blood biochemical markers during aging in the Grey
   Mouse Lemur (Microcebus murinus): impact of gender and season},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {Background: Hematologic and biochemical data are needed to characterize
   the health status of animal populations over time to determine the
   habitat quality and captivity conditions. Blood components and the
   chemical entities that they transport change predominantly with sex and
   age. The aim of this study was to utilize blood chemistry monitoring to
   establish the reference levels in a small prosimian primate, the Grey
   Mouse Lemur (Microcebus murinus).
   Method: In the captive colony, mouse lemurs may live 10-12 years, and
   three age groups for both males and females were studied: young (1-3
   years), middle-aged (4-5 years) and old (6-10 years). Blood biochemical
   markers were measured using the VetScan Comprehensive Diagnostic
   Profile. Because many life history traits of this primate are highly
   dependent on the photoperiod (body mass and reproduction), the effect of
   season was also assessed.
   Results: The main effect of age was observed in blood markers of renal
   functions such as creatinine, which was higher among females.
   Additionally, blood urea nitrogen significantly increased with age and
   is potentially linked to chronic renal insufficiency, which has been
   described in captive mouse lemurs. The results demonstrated significant
   effects related to season, especially in blood protein levels and
   glucose rates; these effects were observed regardless of gender or age
   and were likely due to seasonal variations in food intake, which is very
   marked in this species.
   Conclusion: These results were highly similar with those obtained in
   other primate species and can serve as references for future research of
   the Grey Mouse Lemur.},

Title = {Gait-specific metabolic costs and preferred speeds in ring-tailed lemurs

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {149},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Metabolic costs of resting and locomotion have been used to gain novel
   insights into the behavioral ecology and evolution of a wide range of
   primates; however, most previous studies have not considered
   gait-specific effects. Here, metabolic costs of ring-tailed lemurs
   (Lemur catta) walking, cantering and galloping are used to test for
   gait-specific effects and a potential correspondence between costs and
   preferred speeds. Metabolic costs, including the net cost of locomotion
   (COL) and net cost of transport (COT), change as a curvilinear function
   of walking speed and (at least provisionally) as a linear function of
   cantering and galloping speeds. The baseline quantity used to calculate
   net costs had a significant effect on the magnitude of speed-specific
   estimates of COL and COT, especially for walking. This is because
   non-locomotor metabolism constitutes a substantial fraction (4161\%, on
   average) of gross metabolic rate at slow speeds. The slope-based
   estimate of the COT was 5.26 J kg-1 m-1 for all gaits and speeds, while
   the gait-specific estimates differed between walking (0.5 m s-1: 6.69 J
   kg-1 m-1) and cantering/galloping (2.0 m s-1: 5.61 J kg-1 m-1). During
   laboratory-based overground locomotion, ring-tailed lemurs preferred to
   walk at similar to 0.5 m s-1 and canter/gallop at similar to 2.0 m s-1,
   with the preferred walking speed corresponding well to the COT minima.
   Compared with birds and other mammals, ring-tailed lemurs are relatively
   economical in walking, cantering, and galloping. These results support
   the view that energetic optima are an important movement criterion for
   locomotion in rng-tailed lemurs, and other terrestrial animals. Am J

Abstract = {Camera traps are standard tools for assessing populations of
   medium-large terrestrial mammals, particularly for rare, elusive or
   cryptic species, yet few researchers have attempted to employ camera
   traps to document rare primates in arboreal settings. We examined
   different arboreal camera-trap techniques to document the Critically
   Endangered greater bamboo lemur Prolemur simus in Madagascar. We
   documented P. simus at two sites, confirming presence at one site. Most
   species, including 86\% of all lemur occurrences, were documented in low
   light conditions (c. < 105 lux). Our study suggests that camera traps
   can be effective in validating unconfirmed sightings of rare or
   secretive primate species. We recommend that future work with cameras in
   arboreal settings considers seasonal activity patterns, targets sites
   with high food densities, uses local knowledge, and utilizes available
   techniques (e. g. traditional trapping techniques) and landscape
   topography to concentrate animal movement (e. g. steep slopes or ridge
   lines).},

Abstract = {The particular interest in supplementing human foods with n-3 fatty
   acids has arisen from the findings that this series of polyunsaturated
   fatty acids (PUFA) have an impact on neuronal functions. Indeed
   vertebrates, including humans, preferentially use docosahexaenoic acid
   (DHA, 22:6n-3) over other long-chain n-3 PUFA for the genesis of their
   neuronal and retinal membranes. The grey mouse lemur is a nocturnal
   prosimian primate originating from Madagascar. The increased use of this
   omnivorous primate in nutritional studies (chronic caloric restriction,
   n-3 fatty acids supplementation), justifies the interest of determining
   their fatty acids body composition. In the present study, we report the
   fatty acid composition in lipid classes from the main target tissues
   (brain, retina, liver and adipose tissue) of six adult mouse lemurs
   raised under laboratory nutritional conditions. Among the main findings,
   n-6-docosapentaenoic acid (n-6-DPA; 22:5n-6) is very low in the brain
   cortex and retina, whereas there is a very high accumulation of
   docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) in the neural tissues compared to
   liver and plasma. In particular, DHA accounts for about one half of the
   total fatty acids in the retina ethanolamine glycerophospholipids. This
   high concentration clearly indicates that DHA is efficiently transferred
   from blood lipids to the outer segment of the mouse lemur retina. We
   conclude that the mouse lemur n-3 PUFA metabolism efficiently drives DHA
   to neural tissues, through the blood-brain barrier and the blood-retina
   barrier.},

Abstract = {Displacement activities are behavioural patterns defined by their
   apparent irrelevance to an animal's ongoing actions. Despite being
   identified in diverse taxa, their function remains poorly understood.
   One hypothesis posits that displacement activities facilitate
   transitions between different behaviours by mediating changes in
   animals' motivational state. Under this hypothesis, it is predicted that
   displacement activities will occur more frequently around changes in
   behaviour than at other times, and also that rates of displacement
   activities will be higher before than after such behavioural
   transitions. We tested these two predictions in wild ring-tailed lemurs
   (Lemur catta). During focal observations, animals' behavioural state was
   continuously recorded, as were all occurrences of self-scratching, a
   common displacement activity in this species. Self-scratching rates were
   found to be significantly elevated both before and after behavioural
   transitions. Furthermore, self-scratching rates were significantly
   higher before behavioural transitions occurred than after. These
   results, therefore, provide support for the hypothesis that displacement
   activities facilitate behavioural transitions in L catta. (C) 2012

   in the liver of all the individuals. Histologically, the liver of two of
   them showed a severe parasitic ova infection and lipidosis, the
   morphologic characteristics of the parasitic ovas were consistent with
   Capillaria hepatica (syn. Calodium hepatica) eggs. To the authors'

Abstract = {Cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (cdk5)/p35 and protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) are
   two major enzymes that control a variety of physiological processes
   within the nervous system including neuronal differentiation, synaptic
   plasticity and axonal transport. Defective cdk5/p35 and PP1 function are
   also implicated in several major human neurodegenerative diseases.
   Cdk5/p35 and the catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1C) both bind to the
   brain-enriched, serinethreonine kinase lemur tyrosine kinase-2 (LMTK2).
   Moreover, LMTK2 phosphorylates PP1C on threonine-320 (PP1Cthr320) to
   inhibit its activity. Here, we demonstrate that LMTK2 is phosphorylated
   on serine-1418 (LMTK2ser1418) by cdk5/p35 and present evidence that this
   regulates its ability to phosphorylate PP1Cthr320. We thus describe a
   new signalling pathway within the nervous system that links cdk5/p35
   with PP1C and which has implications for a number of neuronal functions
   and neuronal dysfunction.},

Title = {The gaits of primates: center of mass mechanics in walking, cantering

Abstract = {Most primates, including lemurs, have a broad range of locomotor
   capabilities, yet much of the time, they walk at slow speeds and amble,
   canter or gallop at intermediate and fast speeds. Although numerous
   studies have investigated limb function during primate quadrupedalism,
   how the center of mass (COM) moves is not well understood. Here, we
   examined COM energy, work and power during walking, cantering and
   galloping in ring-tailed lemurs, Lemur catta (N=5), over a broad speed
   range (0.43-2.91 ms(-1)). COM energy recoveries were substantial during
   walking (35-71\%) but lower during canters and gallops (10-51\%). COM
   work, power and collisional losses increased with speed. The positive
   COM works were 0.625 Jkg(-1) m(-1) for walks and 1.661 Jkg(-1) m(-1) for
   canters and gallops, which are in the middle range of published values
   for terrestrial animals. Although some discontinuities in COM mechanics
   were evident between walking and cantering, there was no apparent analog
   to the trot-gallop transition across the intermediate and fast speed
   range (dimensionless v>0.75, Fr>0.5). A phenomenological model of a
   lemur cantering and trotting at the same speed shows that canters ensure
   continuous contact of the body with the substrate while reducing peak
   vertical COM forces, COM stiffness and COM collisions. We suggest that
   cantering, rather than trotting, at intermediate speeds may be tied to
   the arboreal origins of the Order Primates. These data allow us to
   better understand the mechanics of primate gaits and shed new light on
   primate locomotor evolution.},

Abstract = {Seasonal changes may have a strong effect on the safety of sleeping
   sites in arboreal primates. For example, changes in vegetation thickness
   may impact predation risk and energy expenditure related to
   thermoregulation. We investigated how seasonality influenced sleeping
   site characteristics and usage pattern in an arboreal primate living in
   a highly seasonal environment. The western woolly lemur (Avahi
   occidentalis) lives in the dry deciduous forest of northwestern
   Madagascar, where leaf coverage greatly varies across the year. We
   examined the hypothesis that these lemurs change their sleeping site
   behavior dependent on season. We collected data on sleeping site height
   and location, and characterized usage patterns in six radiotagged pairs
   between May and December 2008. During the late dry season, pairs
   preferentially slept in the middle part of a tree. In contrast, there
   was no height preference during the early rainy season. The lemurs used
   more sleeping sites during the early rainy than during the late dry
   season and stayed more days at the same sleeping tree in the late dry
   season. Our findings support the hypothesis that season affects sleeping
   site selection in an arboreal primate species living in a highly
   seasonal environment. During the late dry season, western woolly lemurs
   are particularly conspicuous to hunters and we therefore suggest a
   better monitoring of the forest in this season to guarantee their future
   survival.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the cellular distribution of the pancreatic inflammatory
   protein lithostathine and its receptor EXTL3 in the brain of the
   lemurian primate Microcebus murinus which develops amyloid deposits
   along with aging. In adult animals (2-4.5 years old), lithostathine and
   EXTL3 immunoreactivities were largely distributed in the whole brain,
   and more intensively in almost all cortical layers and hippocampal
   formation. Lithostathine was observed in the perikarya and neurites of
   cortical neurons but also in glial cells in the border of the ventricle
   and the corpus callosum. In healthy aged animals (8-13 years old),
   highest densities of lithostathine-containing cells were observed,
   mainly in occipital and parietal cortex. In aged animals with A beta
   deposits, the increase in lithostathine immunoreactivity was lower as
   compared with aged animals. Noteworthy, lithostathine-immunopositive
   cells did almost never colocalize with A beta plaques. In conclusion,
   lithostathine immunoreactivity in adult Microcebus murinus appeared
   ubiquitous and particularly in visual, sensorial, and cognitive brain
   areas. Immunoreactivity increased with aging and appeared markedly
   affected in neuropathological conditions. Its possible neuroprotection
   or neurodegeneration role in Alzheimer pathology deserves therefore to
   be investigated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Lombok Strait has abundance of Sardine, Sardinella lemuru, which
   contains such high amount of omega-3 fatty acid (omega-3). However, the
   genetic relationship of S. lemuru with other commercial fish rich in
   omega-3 has not been widely studied yet. Studies on genetic proximity of
   S. lemuru with the other marine fish using 12S rRNA gene is very
   important in order to obtain genetic information of the Sardine to
   develop an appropriate strategy for future conservation of the fish in
   Lombok Strait. The aim of this study was to find out the genetic
   relationship of Sardinella lemuru living in Lombok Strait with the
   economically valuable fish and its correlation with omega-3 production.
   Sardinella lemuru were collected from Lombok Strait, the phylogenetic
   tree was done based on 12S rRNA gene through a neighbor-joining method
   to identify the relationship of Sardines and fish rich in omega-3 fatty
   acid. The phylogenetic tree showed that Sardinella lemuru is similar to
   Sardinella aurita and has a close similarity with Sardinella maderensis.
   However, the relationship did not correspond to omega-3 production.
   Based on the results of the study, it is suggested that the production
   of omega-3 is not specifically based on the proximity of the species,
   but it is more associated with conserved domain of Delta 6-desaturase.
   Nevertheless, detailed mechanisms still need to be elucidated.},

   tropical fruiting plants. In Madagascar, lemurs are the principal
   dispersers of fruit-bearing plants. This study aims to highlight the
   potential ecological role of the red-ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra) in the
   regeneration of a degraded forest, based on the quantity and size of
   passed seeds, their viability and germination, and seedling growth. In
   Masoala National Park, V rubra groups were followed daily from dawn to
   dusk to collect fresh fecal samples containing seeds. We determined seed
   viability by immersion, and created an on-site nursery to compare the
   germination and growth of emerged seedlings from egested versus
   non-egested seeds. V rubra dispersed a diverse group of plant species
   with mainly large-sized seeds, which remained undamaged by gut passage.
   Defecated seeds were viable and had a higher germination success than
   control seeds. There was also increased growth among seedlings of
   defecated seeds, suggesting V rubra may play an important role in the
   regeneration of a degraded habitat through seed dispersal.},

Abstract = {The increase in the amount of available biomedical information has
   resulted in a higher demand on biomedical information retrieval systems.
   However, traditional information retrieval systems do not achieve the
   desired performance in this area. Query expansion techniques have
   improved the effectiveness of ranked retrieval by automatically adding
   additional terms to a query. In this work we test several automatic
   query expansion techniques using the Lemur Language Modelling Toolkit.
   The objective is to evaluate a set of query expansion techniques when
   they are applied to biomedical information retrieval. In the first step
   of the information retrieval searching, indexing, we compare the use of
   several techniques of stemming and stopwords. In the second step,
   matching, we compare the well-known weighting algorithms Okapi and
   TF-IDF BM25. The best results are obtained with the combination of
   Krovetz stemmer, SMART stopword list and TF-IDF. Moreover, we analyze
   the document retrieval based on Abstract, Title and Mesh fields. We
   conclude that seems more effective than looking at each of these fields
   individually. Also, we show that the use of feedback in document
   retrieval results a improvement in retrieving. The corpus used in the
   experiments was extracted from the biomedical text Cystic Fibrosis
   Corpus (CF).},

Abstract = {The assessment of lemuru fish (Sardinella lemuru) using remote sensing
   and Geographical Information System (GIS) has provided preliminary
   information on the habitat of lemuru fish at the South waters of Malang
   Regency, Indonesia. Lemuru fish catch data, mangrove mapping, Sea
   Surface Temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration derived from
   MODIS/Aqua images have been used in this study. The average of SST
   during the study was 26.1 degrees C, the highest average was on December
   and August was the lowest. The average of chlorophyll-a concentration
   was 0.55 mg/m(3), July was the highest and the lowest concentration of
   chlorophyll-a was on March. Most of the lemuru fish migrated to the west
   part of Malang waters during northwest monsoon (December-February), and
   moved toward eastern part during transitional (March-April-May). In
   contrast, on the southeast monsoon (June - August), lemuru spread across
   Malang waters. Habitat suitability of lemuru around coastal waters of
   Malang Regency related to their migration has different criteria for
   each month depend on the oceanographic factors and primary productivity.
   Based on the levels of habitat suitability, lemuru predicted to spawn on
   June. Sumbermanjing area was the most suitable area (72.39\%). Lemuru
   moved away from Malang waters during transitional until the beginning of
   northwest monsoon. Primary productivity in coastal waters around
   Sumbermanjing increased in the southeast monsoon. It represented by
   January (0.7 mg/m(3)) in the northwest monsoon and increased reaches 3
   mg/m(3) in the southeast monsoon on July. It was followed by the
   increasing of lemuru catch.},

Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed extensive research into problem solving and
   innovation in primates, yet lemurs have not been subjected to the same
   level of attention as apes and monkeys, and the social context in which
   novel behavior appears has rarely been considered. We gave novel
   foraging puzzlebox devices to seven groups of ruffed lemurs (Varecia
   variegata and Varecia rubra) to examine the factors affecting rates of
   innovation and social learning. We found, across a range of group sex
   ratios, that animals of the less-represented sex were more likely to
   contact and solve the puzzlebox sooner than those of the
   more-represented sex. We established that while some individuals were
   able to solve the puzzleboxes there was no evidence of social learning.
   Our findings are consistent with previously reported male deference as a
   sexual strategy, but we conclude that the need for male deference
   diminishes when, within a group, males are rare. Am. J. Primatol. 73:

Abstract = {Oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers are susceptible to
   endocrine treatments, such as tamoxifen. However, resistance is a major
   problem when treating breast cancer with these agents. ER alpha
   phosphorylation is implicated in this resistance to tamoxifen, and
   kinases are the enzymes that catalyse phosphorylation. A kinome search
   in human breast cancer cells identified lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3).
   In primary breast cancer samples, high nuclear LMTK3 expression was
   associated with a shorter disease-free survival time. In
   tamoxifen-resistant cell lines, the addition of LMTK3 siRNA, increased
   the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen. In nude mice, with established human
   MCF-7 breast cancer tumours, LMTK3 siRNA decreased tumour growth. In
   conclusion, LMKT3 is a possible target and marker of breast cancer.},

Abstract = {Many animals are organized into social groups and have to synchronize
   their activities to maintain group cohesion. Although activity budgets,
   habitat constraints, and group properties may impact on behavioural
   synchrony, little is known regarding how members of a group reach a
   consensus on the timing of activities such as foraging bouts. Game
   theory predicts that pair partners should synchronize their activities
   when there is an advantage of foraging together. As a result of this
   synchronization, differences in the energetic reserves of the two
   players develop spontaneously and the individual with lower reserves
   emerges as a pacemaker of the synchrony. Here, we studied the behavioral
   synchrony of pair-living, nocturnal, red-tailed sportive lemurs
   (Lepilemur ruficaudatus). We observed 8 pairs continuously for a parts
   per thousand yen1 annual reproductive cycle in Kirindy Forest, Western
   Madagascar. During focal observations, one observer followed the female
   of a pair and, simultaneously, another observer followed the male. We
   recorded the location and behavioral state of the focal individual every
   5 min via instantaneous sampling. Although behavioral synchrony of pair
   partners appeared to be due mainly to endogenous activity patterns, they
   actively synchronized when they were in visual contact (< 10 m).
   Nevertheless, red-tailed sportive lemurs benefit from synchronizing
   their activity only for 15\% of the time, when they are close together.
   The lack of an early warning system for predators and weak support for
   benefits via social information transfer in combination with energetic
   constraints may explain why red-tailed sportive lemurs do not spend more
   time together and thus reap the benefits of behavioral synchrony.},

   include only two pairs of pedunculated papillae, 2 pairs of sessile
   papillae, and 1 pair of phasmids. As the same pattern was observed in

Abstract = {The Grey Mouse Lemur (Microcebus murinus) is a nocturnal lemur species
   that lives only in Madagascar. It is one of the most abundant lemur
   species and its native populations are not endangered, but animals
   belonging to this species are rarely exhibited in zoos. While tumours
   are quite frequently described in other primates, there are very few
   publications about neoplasia in lemurs. In this case report we describe
   a mandibular osteoblastic osteosarcoma in a Grey Mouse Lemur (Microcebus
   murinus). To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first
   scientific article describing osteosarcoma in a prosimian and also
   reporting a tumour in the mandible in this taxon.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {The alarming rate of deforestation in Madagascar is driving some endemic
   primates to extinction. Surprisingly, anthropogenic habitat disturbance
   is not always deleterious. The effect of disturbance on lemur abundance
   may be related to diet, with frugivorous species more prone to
   population declines than folivores or insectivores. To test the effects
   of disturbance on lemur abundance and group size, we surveyed 2 sites
   within contiguous forest at Ranomafana National Park, 1 lightly
   disturbed primary forest (Vato) and 1 heavily logged forest (Tala). We
   quantified forest structure variables along 6 survey routes and
   conducted 68 diurnal and 42 nocturnal lemur surveys. Canopy closure,
   canopy height, and understory visibility were greater in Vato than in
   Tala. We encountered 2 frugivorous lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons, Varecia
   variegata) and 1 folivore (Avahi peyrierasi) significantly more
   frequently in Vato than in Tala, whereas the opposite was true for the
   insectivorous Microcebus rufus. Rates did not differ statistically for 1
   frugivore (Eulemur rubriventer) and 2 folivores (Propithecus edwardsi,
   Hapalemur griseus). Comparisons across the 6 survey routes suggest that
   the abundance was heterogeneous within as well as between sites. Neither
   group size nor composition differed between sites. Encounter rates for
   Varecia variegata were positively related to canopy closure, and
   encounter rates for Avahi peyrierasi were positively related to canopy
   height. Encounter rates for Microcebus rufus were negatively related to
   canopy closure, height, and understory visibility. Similar to other
   studies, the results suggest that some lemurs, including folivores, may
   cope with anthropogenic disturbance better than others, including some
   frugivores. Lemur abundance is heterogeneous, though, even on small
   spatial scales.},

Title = {Tamarind tree seed dispersal by ring-tailed lemurs},
Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {391-396},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In Madagascar, the gallery forests of the south are among the most
   endangered. Tamarind trees (Tamarindus indica) dominate these riverine
   forests and are a keystone food resource for ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur
   catta). At Berenty Reserve, the presence of tamarind trees is declining,
   and there is little recruitment of young trees. Because mature tamarinds
   inhibit growth under their crowns, seeds must be dispersed away from
   adult trees if tree recruitment is to occur. Ring-tailed lemurs are
   likely seed dispersers; however, because they spend much of their
   feeding, siesta, and sleeping time in tamarinds, they may defecate a
   majority of the tamarind seeds under tamarind trees. To determine
   whether they disperse tamarind seeds away from overhanging tamarind tree
   crowns, we observed two troops for 10 days each, noted the locations of
   feeding and defecation, and collected seeds from feces and fruit for
   germination. We also collected additional data on tamarind seedling
   recruitment under natural conditions, in which seedling germination was
   abundant after extensive rain, including under the canopy. However,
   seedling survival to 1 year was lower when growing under mature tamarind
   tree crowns than when growing away from an overhanging crown. Despite
   low fruit abundance averaging two fruits/m(3) in tamarind crowns, lemurs
   fed on tamarind fruit for 32\% of their feeding samples. Daily path
   lengths averaged 1,266 m, and lemurs deposited seeds throughout their
   ranges. Fifty-eight percent of the 417 recorded lemur defecations were
   on the ground away from overhanging tamarind tree crowns. Tamarind seeds
   collected from both fruit and feces germinated. Because lemurs deposited
   viable seeds on the ground away from overhanging mature tamarind tree
   crowns, we conclude that ring-tailed lemurs provide tamarind tree seed
   dispersal services.},

Abstract = {The population of the Near Threatened brown lemur Eulemur fulvus on the
   island of Mayotte was censused in 1974, 1984 and 1999. We carried out a
   new census in 2008, estimating individual and group densities in the
   three main habitat types on the island (preserved forest, anthropogenic
   forest and agricultural areas), and more generally evaluating population
   trends. Data included sex ratios and the number of young <1 year-old per
   female. The census was at the end of the dry season, along 14 transect
   lines of 0.5 or 1 km length. Counts of groups and individuals were
   repeated three times between 07.00 and 10.00 and between 15.00 and
   18.00. The densities of groups and individuals were calculated using
   Distance. By 2008 group and individual densities had significantly
   decreased in preserved forest, and there was also a decrease in group
   size in all habitat types. The 2008 census also showed that the overall
   population of E. fulvus on Mayotte has decreased by about half since
   1999. We suggest that these changes reflect environmental stress
   associated with a decrease in available food resources. Urgent action to
   preserve forest habitat is necessary for the long-term survival of this
   lemur.},

Abstract = {Seed dispersal is a pivotal ecological process but remains poorly
   understood on Madagascar, where lemurs are key dispersers. The
   black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata) possesses many
   behavioural and ecological attributes potentially conducive to effective
   seed dispersal, but no studies have investigated dispersal patterns in
   this species. This 3-mo study quantified aspects of the primary seed
   dispersal patterns generated by two Varecia variegata groups (7
   individuals). Feeding and ranging behaviour was quantified using
   behavioural observation (345.6 h), dispersal quantity and seed identity
   was determined by faecal analysis, and 10-wk germination trials tested
   effects of gut passage on germination of four species. Individual lemurs
   dispersed an estimated 104 seeds d(-1), of 40 species. Most seeds were
   large (>10 mm); the largest was 42 mm long. Gut passage was rapid (mean
   4.4 h) and generally increased germination speed and success. Mean and
   maximum inferred dispersal distances were 180 and 506 m respectively;
   low compared with many anthropoids, but possibly typical of lemurs.
   Though limited by a short study period, results suggest that the ruffed
   lemur is an effective disperser of seeds and possibly a critical
   disperser of large-seeded species which other frugivores cannot swallow.
   Loss of large-bodied seed dispersers such as Varecia variegata may have
   far-reaching ecological consequences including impacts on forest
   structure and dynamics.},

Abstract = {In previous studies we demonstrated that brown and black lemurs (Eulemur
   fulvus and E. macaco) showed self-control abilities under a
   reverse-reward contingency. They were able to significantly select the
   smaller quantity of food to be rewarded with the larger one and to
   generalize this ability when presented with two rewards that differed in
   quality. In the present study, previously trained subjects had to choose
   between graphic representations of two different quantities of food
   under the reverse-reward contingency. Three out of four subjects learned
   to associate a graphic representation of the reward with the
   corresponding quantity. Only one subject consistently selected the
   representation of the smaller quantity to be rewarded with the larger
   quantity of food and therefore showed abstraction as well as relative
   numerousness skills. Indeed, she was able to discriminate between
   representations of different quantities and to ordinate them. We discuss
   how primates mentally represent food quantities and how self-control is
   involved in foraging strategies.},

Title = {Feeding Behavior and Nutrient Intake in Spiny Forest-Dwelling
   Ring-Tailed Lemurs (Lemur catta) During Early Gestation and Early to
   Mid-Lactation Periods: Compensating in a Harsh Environment},

Abstract = {Strong resource seasonality in Madagascar has led to the evolution of
   female feeding priority and weaning synchrony in most lemur species. For
   these taxa, pregnancy/early lactation periods coincide with low food
   availability, and weaning of infants is timed with increased resources
   at the onset of the rainy season. Reproductive females experience high
   metabolic requirements, which they must accommodate, particularly when
   food resources are scarce. Female ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)
   residing in spiny forest habitat must deal with resource scarcity, high
   temperatures (similar to 36-40 degrees C) and little shade in early to
   mid-lactation periods. Considered ``income breeders,{''} these females
   must use resources obtained from the environment instead of relying on
   fat stores; thus, we expected they would differ from same-sized males in
   time spent on feeding and in the intake of food and nutrients. We
   investigated these variables in two groups (N = 11 and 12) of Lemur
   catta residing in spiny forest habitat during early gestation and early
   to mid-lactation periods. Focal animal data and food plant samples were
   collected, and plants were analyzed for protein, kcal, and fiber. We
   found no sex differences for any feeding or nutrient intake variable for
   the top five food species consumed. Females in early gestation spent
   more time feeding compared with early/mid-lactation. Physiological
   compensation for spiny forest-dwelling females may be tied to greater
   time spent resting compared with gallery forest conspecifics, consuming
   foods high in protein, calories, and water, reduced home range defense
   in a sparsely populated habitat, and for Lemur catta females in general,
   production of relatively dilute milk compared with many strepsirrhines.

Abstract = {Four species of Eugenia are newly proposed for Madagascar. Eugenia
   ardyceae and Eugenia louisae occur in the southeast region near
   Tolagnaro; Eugenia nosibensis is restricted to Nosy Be off of the
   northern coast; and E. lacerosepala occurs in the northeast. Eugenia
   ardyceae and E. nosibensis each are known from several gatherings, E.
   louisae is known from two collections, and E. lacerosepala is known only
   from the type collection. Eugenia nosibensis is relatively common in the
   Lokobe Reserve Integra le, and its fruits are eaten by black lemurs
   (Eulemur macaco). The recommended conservation status for the species
   based on the IUCN criteria is Endangered for Eugenia lacerosepala and E.
   louisae, and Vulnerable for E. ardyceae and E. nosibensis. The
   importance of noting and reporting the local relative abundance of
   species when they are collected is discussed, particularly in remote,
   biodiversity-rich areas that are rarely visited. Such information helps
   later workers formulate conservation recommendations and aids in the
   prioritizing of later field trips that target rare taxa for further

Abstract = {To reduce male male aggression in collared lemurs (Eulemur collaris) at
   Disney's Animal Kingdom, a clinical trial of leuprolide acetate
   (Depo-Lupron (R)) injections through one breeding season (24 wk),
   followed by surgical castration after the breeding season was
   implemented. Daily behavioral observations to record occurrences of
   aggression were conducted before and during the injection period, as
   well as after castration. Fecal sample collection began 2 wk before the
   first injection and continued throughout the clinical trial to determine
   testosterone metabolite concentration. Samples were collected 3 times
   per week. Fecal collection and behavioral observation continued for 5 mo
   after castration. Fecal samples from 3 intact males from other
   institutions were obtained to compare testosterone values. While the
   lemurs were treated with Depo-Lupron, testosterone concentrations spiked
   immediately after injection, and then returned to pretreatment,
   nonbreeding-season levels after varying lengths of time. Analysis of the
   behavioral data indicated that aggression was not significantly reduced
   with Depo-Lupron treatment. However, after castration, contact
   aggression and wounding decreased to zero. Although the sample is small,
   this study presents the first documented data on the effects that
   chemical treatment with Depo-Lupron and surgical castration have upon
   hormone levels and aggressive behavior in eulemurs.},

Abstract = {Greater bamboo lemurs (Prolemur simus) are endemic to Madagascar and are
   the only recognized species within their genus. The IUCN lists the
   species as critically endangered, with very few confirmed distribution
   records and < 200 individuals known in the wild. With the aim of
   contributing to its conservation, we attempted to find previously
   unknown sites containing the species. Working closely with local
   communities, and basing our methodology on the gathering of local
   knowledge, we surveyed 44 sites in and around the Ankeniheny-Zahamena
   Corridor. We found evidence of the presence of Prolemur simus at 18
   sites. We made direct sightings at 6 sites, of a total of 65 confirmed
   individuals, and identified their characteristic feeding remains at the
   other sites. Twelve of the sites are located in midaltitude rain forest
   within the corridor, and 6 lie in isolated and degraded lowland areas
   outside the corridor. These discoveries more than double the number of
   sites where the species is known to occur, and extend its known range 85
   km further north. We identified numerous threats to the newly discovered
   sites, including hunting pressure, habitat destruction, habitat
   disturbance, and habitat fragmentation. Demographic factors related to
   small population sizes and population isolation may also impact the
   viability of the populations. Our results illustrate the benefits of
   systematic gathering of local knowledge when searching for rare or
   secretive primates.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Madagascar's ecosystems are subject to high levels of anthropogenic
   disturbance and stochastic events, including cyclones. We investigated
   the abundance of gray-headed lemurs (Eulemur cinereiceps) and vegetation
   structure in the fragmented forest of Manombo from 1995 to 2007,
   including 10 yr following Cyclone Gretelle in January 1997. We predicted
   that the density of this arboreal, frugivorous lemur would be similar in
   the pre- and post-cyclone intervals only if tree measures demonstrate
   trends toward recovery in the post-cyclone period. Initial impacts
   included severe damage to over 60 percent of trees. After 10 yr, all
   vegetation metrics except for stem density remained low relative to the
   pre-cyclone period, including dbh, height, and basal area. To
   investigate vegetation changes separately from cyclone effects, we
   compared forest structure in the pre-cyclone period alone. Basal area
   declined but dbh and stem density did not vary between 1995 and 1997;
   thus, anthropogenic activities or other factors did not consistently
   alter forest structure in this 2-yr period. Subsequent changes may be
   linked to cyclone response, presumably in synergy with human
   disturbance. Contrary to predictions, recent gray-headed lemur
   population densities were nearly identical to those recorded in 1995
   (13.5 +/- 3.2 vs. 13.6 +/- 6.4 individuals/km2, respectively). Lemur
   populations may have remained stable or declined initially and then
   recovered in the last 10 yr. Life history and ecological adaptations may
   explain their resistance or resilience when faced with habitat change.
   Recent models suggest that lemurs have evolved in response to
   unpredictable environmental conditions. Such environmental variability
   may increase with projected climate change.},

Abstract = {We here report the genomic organisation of the grey mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus) MHC class II DQ and DR region based on BAC clone
   analysis. The sequenced Mimu-MHC haplotype spans 343 kb and encompasses
   the genes TAP2, DOB, DQB, DQA, DRB, DRA, BTNL2 and a further BTNL gene.
   The DQ and DR genes of this haplotype are not duplicated. Mimu-DOB is
   not transcribed and represents a pseudogene due to deletions and
   premature stop codons. Analysis of BAC clone DNA, a cDNA sample and
   eight genomic DNA samples suggests that Mimu-DRB, Mimu-DQA and Mimu-DQB
   are highly polymorphic with the majority of peptide-binding residues
   being affected by polymorphisms. In contrast, Mimu-DRA is moderately
   polymorphic, and the variable amino acid positions are not part of the
   peptide-binding region. Phylogenetic analysis of Mimu-DQA and Mimu-DQB
   and other primate DQA and DQB genes indicates that duplication of DQA
   and DQB loci occurred in Anthropoidea after the split from
   Strepsirrhini.},

Abstract = {Whilst the ability to follow human gaze has been demonstrated in monkeys
   and apes, there is little evidence that prosimians share this ability.
   The current study used a food choice paradigm to assess whether captive
   brown (Eulemur fulvus) and ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) use human
   gaze direction as a cue when choosing between an attending or
   non-attending human. Four experiments assessed the use of body, head and
   eye cues by the lemurs. In experiment 1, the non-attending human stood
   with her back to a food item; 3 of the 5 lemurs preferentially chose the
   attending human with an equivalent food item in view. In experiments 2
   and 3, which used head angles of 90, 4 out of 5 lemurs preferentially
   chose the attending human. In experiment 4, in which the humans differed
   only by whether their eyes were open or shut, no significant preferences
   were found. This study provides the first tentative evidence that lemurs
   are capable of discriminating human gaze direction and can use both body
   and head direction to do so. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {The Spiny Thicket Ecoregion (STE) of Southern and southwestern
   Madagascar was recently home to numerous giant lemurs and other
   ``megafauna,{''} including pygmy hippopotamuses, giant tortoises,
   elephant birds, and large euplerid carnivores. Following the arrival of
   humans more than 2,000 years ago, dramatic extinctions occurred. Only
   one-third of the lemur species which earlier occupied the STE survive
   today; other taxa suffered even greater losses. We use stable isotope
   biogeochemistry to reconstruct past diets and habitat preferences of the
   recently extinct lemurs of the STE. We show that the extinct lemurs
   occupied a wide range of niches, often distinct from those filled by
   coeval non-primates. Many of the now-extinct lemurs regularly exploited
   habitats that were drier than the gallery forests in which the remaining
   lemurs of this ecoregion are most often protected and studied. Most fed
   predominantly on C3 plants and some were likely the main dispersers of
   the large seeds of native C3 trees; others included CAM and/or C4 plants
   in their diets. These new data suggest that the recent extinctions have
   likely had significant ecological ramifications for the communities and
   ecosystems of Southern and southwestern Madagascar. Am. J. Primatol.

Title = {Coping with low-quality diets: a first account of the feeding ecology of
   the southern gentle lemur, Hapalemur meridionalis, in the Mandena
   littoral forest, southeast Madagascar},
Journal = {PRIMATES},

Abstract = {Malagasy primates of the genus Hapalemur are exceptional in their
   exhibition of specialisations allowing for a folivorous diet despite
   their small body size. Members of this group are well known for their
   preference for specific parts of woody bamboo, the primary food resource
   throughout much of their range. The southern gentle lemur (H.
   meridionalis), however, inhabits littoral forests that contain little or
   no woody bamboo. Similar to its closely related congener, the Alaotran
   gentle lemur (H. alaotrensis), the question is raised as to how these
   lemurs subsist in this ecological context. The aim of this study was to
   gain an initial understanding of the ecological niche of the southern
   gentle lemur in the threatened ecosystem of the littoral forest of
   southeastern Madagascar. Lemurs were habituated and observed over a
   3-month period during the austral winter, allowing for collection of
   both continuous and instantaneous focal data on their feeding ecology.
   Preferred food species were identified and collected, and biochemical
   analyses determined macronutrient and secondary compound values for
   consumed food items. The diet of the southern gentle lemur was found to
   be of low nutritional quality, as evaluated through the low
   protein-to-fibre ratio, especially when compared with other folivores.
   This lemur is also unique in spending a majority of its time grazing on
   terrestrial grasses (family Poaceae) during the resource-poor winter
   months. Our data indicate that Hapalemur spp. possess a behavioural
   flexibility, and possibly, digestive abilities, higher than previously
   thought for an animal of its small body size.},

Abstract = {A common paradigm used to study inhibitory control is the reverse-reward
   contingency task in which the subject is presented with a choice between
   two different quantities of food and is rewarded with the non-chosen
   item. Most animals have problems inhibiting their impulsive choice
   towards the larger quantity, and need correction procedures to master
   the reverse-reward task. Recent studies have nonetheless shown that
   rhesus macaques and white crowned mangabeys were able to master the task
   without correction procedures after a large number of trials were
   applied.
   We previously demonstrated that, similar to other primates tested under
   the reverse-reward contingency task, lemurs initially showed an
   impulsive bias towards the larger quantity of food. But following
   introduction of a large-or-none contingency, all the subjects learned to
   reliably select the smaller quantity in order to gain access to the
   larger one. Here, we assessed the possibility that, similar to rhesus
   macaques and mangabeys, lemurs could master the reverse-reward task,
   without a modified procedure, by presenting a large number of trials.
   One of 5 subjects was able to master the task and then generalize
   performance to novel food arrays. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Infections with gastrointestinal parasites may be a major threat to
   lemurs kept in captivity, as they are a common cause of diarrhea. In
   this study, fecal egg count patterns and clinical signs associated with
   gastrointestinal nematodes were assessed for 12 mo in 40 lemurs kept
   under different husbandry and climatic conditions at two sites in
   Madagascar. Involved species were black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia
   variegata), eastern grey bamboo lemurs (Hapalemur griseus), greater
   bamboo lemurs (Pro lemur simus), red-bellied lemurs (Eulemur
   rubriventer), common brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus), crowned lemurs
   (Eulemur coronatus), and Sclater's black lemurs (Eulemur macaco
   flavifrons). At site 1 (Tsimbazaza Zoological Park), lemurs were kept in
   small enclosures with daily cleaning of the cement soiling and without
   routine anthelmintic program, whereas at site 2 (Ivoloina Zoological
   Park), lemurs received routine anthelmintic prophylaxis and were housed
   in small enclosure with daily cleaning of sandy soil enclosures. A total
   of five genera of nematode eggs from the orders Strongylida, Oxyurida,
   and Enoplida were recovered and identified from 198 out of 240 samples
   (83\%) at site 1 and 79\% (189 out of 240) at site 2 with the use of a
   modified McMaster technique. Significant differences were found for
   parasites from the order Strongylida between the two sites. The
   differences may be due to climate conditions and the presumed life cycle
   of these parasites. No significant differences were found for parasites
   from the other orders. No significant differences were noted between
   sexes or between seasons. No clinical signs of parasitic gastroenteritis
   were seen in either lemur collection.},

Abstract = {Nonhuman primates may defend crucial resources using acoustic or
   chemical signals. When essential resources are limited, ownership
   display for a resource may be enhanced. Defending resources may depend
   on population density and habitat characteristics. Using the Milne
   Edwards' sportive lemurs (Lepilemur edwardsi) and weasel sportive lemurs
   (L. mustelinus) as models, we tested whether two cryptic nocturnal lemur
   species differing in population density and habitat show differences in
   their vocal and chemical communication for signaling ownership of
   resources. L. edwardsi inhabits a western dry deciduous forest in a
   high-density population, whereas L. mustelinus is found in an eastern
   rainforest in low density. We followed ten L. edwardsi (six males and
   four females) and nine L. mustelinus (four males and five females) for
   215hr during the early evening (06:00-10:00 p. m.) and the early morning
   (02: 00-05:00 a.m.) and recorded their behavior using focal animal
   sampling. We found that both species differed in their vocal and
   chemical communication. L. edwardsi was highly vocal and displayed loud
   calling in the mornings and evenings while feeding or in the vicinity of
   resting places. In contrast, L. mustelinus never vocalized during
   observations, but displayed tree-gouging behavior that was never
   observed in L. edwardsi. Tree gouging occurred more often during early
   evening sessions than early morning sessions. Subjects gouged trees
   after leaving their sleeping hole and before moving around. We suggest
   that, in weasel sportive lemurs, non-nutritive tree gouging is used as a
   scent-marking behavior in order to display ownership of sleeping sites.
   Altogether, our findings provide first empirical evidence on the
   evolution of different communication systems in two cryptic nocturnal
   primate species contrasting in habitat quality and population density.
   Further investigations are needed to provide more insight into the
   underlying mechanisms. Am. J. Primatol. 72:1062-1072, 2010. (C) 2010

   species, Cheirogaleus medius, no direct evidence of hibernation, i.e.,
   body temperature recordings, has been reported for any of the three
   recognized eastern dwarf lemur species. We present skin temperature data
   collected by external collar transmitters from two eastern dwarf lemur
   individuals (Cheirogaleus crossleyi) captured in the high-altitude
   forest of Tsinjoarivo, central-eastern Madagascar. Our study species is
   larger in body size than western dwarf lemurs and inhabits much colder
   environments. We present the first evidence of hibernation in an eastern
   dwarf lemur species, and we compare the results with data available for
   the western species. Although the hibernation period is shorter in dwarf
   lemurs from Tsinjoarivo, minimum body temperatures are lower than those
   reported for C. medius. Both individuals at Tsinjoarivo showed limited
   passive and extended deep hibernation during which they did not track
   ambient temperature as observed in most western dwarf lemurs. Because
   ambient temperatures at Tsinjoarivo never exceed 30A degrees C, dwarf
   lemurs have to experience arousals to maintain homeostasis during
   periods of hibernation. We show that large dwarf lemurs (> 400 g) are
   capable of undergoing deep hibernation and suggest that cold,
   high-altitude forests may render hibernation highly advantageous during
   periods of food scarcity. This study has implications for understanding
   the physiology of hibernation in small-bodied lemurs.},

Title = {Satellite imagery as a single source of predictor variables for habitat
   suitability modelling: how Landsat can inform the conservation of a
   critically endangered lemur},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {47},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1094-1102},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {P>1. Statistical modelling of habitat suitability is an important tool
   for planning conservation interventions, particularly for areas where
   species distribution data are expensive or hard to collect. Sometimes
   however the predictor variables typically used in habitat suitability
   modelling are themselves difficult to obtain or not meaningful at the
   geographical extent of the study, as is the case for the Alaotran gentle
   lemur Hapalemur alaotrensis, a critically endangered lemur confined to
   the marshes of Lake Alaotra in Madagascar.
   2. We developed a habitat suitability model where all predictor
   variables, including vegetation indices and image texture measures at
   different scales (as surrogates for habitat structure), were derived
   from Landsat7 satellite imagery. Using relatively few presence records,
   the maximum entropy (Maxent) approach and AUC were used to assess the
   performance of candidate predictor variables, for studying the effect of
   scale, model selection and mapping suitable habitat.
   3. This study demonstrated the utility of satellite imagery as a single
   source of predictor variables for a Maxent habitat suitability model at
   the landscape level, within a restricted geographical extent and with a
   fine grain, in a case where predictor variables typically used at the
   macro-scale level (e.g. climatic and topographic) were not applicable.
   4. In the case of H. alaotrensis, the methodology generated a habitat
   suitability map to inform conservation management in Lake Alaotra and a
   replicable protocol to allow rapid updates to habitat suitability maps
   in the future. The exploration of candidate predictor variables allowed
   the identification of scales that appear ecologically relevant for the
   species.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This study presents a cost-effective
   combination of maximum entropy habitat suitability modelling and
   satellite imagery, where all predictor variables are derived solely from
   Landsat7 images. With a habitat modelling method like Maxent that shows
   good performance with few presence samples and Landsat images now freely
   available, the methodology can play an important role in rapid
   assessments of the status of species at the landscape level in data-poor
   regions, when typical macro-scale environmental predictors are of little
   use or difficult to obtain.},

Abstract = {The complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome of Hubbard's or Zombitse
   sportive lemur (Lepilemur hubbardorum) was generated by polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) amplification, primer-walking sequencing and fragment
   cloning. Comparative analyses of Hubbard's sportive lemur were conducted
   with available complete mitochondrial genome sequences from eight other
   lemur species. The mitochondrial genome of Hubbard's sportive lemur is
   16,854 base pairs (bp) and contains 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer
   RNA (tRNA) genes, two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and one control region.
   Three rare start codons were found, in which GTG is the start codon for
   the ATPase 6 subunit gene (ATP), ATC for the NADH dehydrogenase (ND) 2
   subunit gene, and ATT for the ND5 subunit gene. In the control region,
   sequence analysis found one repetitive unit between conserved sequence
   blocks (CSB)-1 and CSB-2 for L hubbardorum. Comparative analysis of
   eight other lemur species showed different repetitive units between and
   outside of these two blocks. According to the phylogenetic analysis of
   the 12 heavy-strand encoded protein-coding genes, all nine lemur species
   representative of four lemuriformes families were monophyletic. This
   template and the newly designed primers described in this study will
   allow scientists to generate comparative sequences for all sportive
   lemurs to validate phylogenetic discrepancies in the genus Lepilemur and
   to evaluate evolutionary and biogeographic models. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Title = {Are there Ubiquitous Parasite-driven Major Histocompatibility Complex
   Selection Mechanisms in Gray Mouse Lemurs?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {519-537},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A major goal of evolutionary biology is to understand how selection
   drives local adaptation. For example, the major histocompatibility
   complex (MHC) plays an important role in the immune system, and high
   levels of MHC variation are thought to be a form of adaptation in
   natural populations. Individual MHC composition may influence parasite
   resistance via advantages associated with 1) heterozygosity, because
   heterozygotes recognize a broader range of different antigens than
   homozygotes (heterozygote advantage); 2) highly variable amino acid
   sequences in MHC alleles, allowing individuals to bind a broader
   spectrum of parasite-derived peptides (divergent-alleles advantage, a
   mechanistic variant of the heterozygote advantage model); or 3) specific
   MHC alleles (rare allele advantage or frequency dependent selection). We
   investigated relationships between gastrointestinal nematode burden and
   both adaptive immune gene variability (MHC class II DRB) and neutral
   microsatellites in free-living gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus)
   native to a dry deciduous forest population in western Madagascar to
   test these hypotheses. The individual MHC composition was related to
   parasite infestation. Specific MHC alleles were involved in parasite
   resistance and the presence of common alleles negatively influenced
   infestation intensity. We found no support for the heterozygote
   advantage hypothesis, but we did find support for the divergent-MHC
   allele advantage hypothesis: Individuals with very divergent MHC alleles
   carried fewer and less intense nematode infestations than individuals
   with more similar alleles in the more variable dry deciduous forest
   population. These results indicate that intestinal parasites are
   important selection pressures under natural conditions and suggest that
   different selection mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. In contrast,
   we detected no association between neutral overall individual genetic
   diversity (measured via 17 microsatellites) and parasite load. Finally,
   we investigated the ubiquity of parasite-driven selection mechanisms by
   comparing our results with a previous study of a mouse lemur population
   from the climatically different littoral forest in southeastern
   Madagascar, ca. 500 km away. This revealed that different specific MHC
   alleles were involved in parasite resistance in the 2 habitats, showing
   that gene-parasite associations are not consistent between populations.},

Title = {Resting and nesting in a small mammal: sleeping sites as a limiting
   resource for female grey mouse lemurs},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {79},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Animals spend a substantial proportion of their lives resting and
   consequently the choice of a sleeping site can dramatically affect an
   individual's fitness. Sleeping sites have been implicated in predator
   defence and thermoregulation and their distribution can affect breeding
   and social systems in small mammals. Sleeping sites may constitute a
   limiting resource for females which experience energetic constraints to
   breeding and require shelter for their young. Despite the potential
   importance of sleeping sites, exhaustive studies of the factors
   determining their usage patterns are limited to a small number of mammal
   groups. We investigated how seasonal changes in temperature or the
   presence of young shape sleeping site usage patterns in a small primate,
   the grey mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus. Females preferred tree holes
   over nests and open sites and the usage duration of a particular tree
   hole site was affected by the physical characteristics likely to affect
   its insulation properties. Furthermore, climate variables strongly
   affected sleeping site choices and nests were chosen more often than
   tree holes during the wet season. However, when young were present
   preferences shifted back to tree holes. Preferred tree species used as
   sleeping sites as well as the properties of tree holes were rare among
   trees in the study area suggesting that sleeping sites may indeed be a
   limiting resource for female grey mouse lemurs. Our results suggest that
   in the study species sleeping site choices are governed by
   thermoregulatory considerations and their limited availability could
   also account for the social grouping. (C) 2010 The Association for the

Abstract = {Subcutaneous and intraperitoneal cysticercosis due to Taenia crassiceps
   was diagnosed in a 5-yr-old male ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) in the
   Madrid Zoo-Aquarium (Madrid, Spain). Under laparoscopic examination,
   several septated fibrous cystic structures and numerous masses of small
   transparent vesicles (ca. 3 mm in diameter) were observed subcutaneously
   and inside the peritoneal cavity. Most of the structures were extirpated
   but, after 2 days of postsurgical intensive care, the animal died. The
   loss of body weight of the animal after surgical extirpation (566 g)
   represented 22\% of the total weight (body weight before mass removal,
   2,582 g). The vesicles were identified under light microscopic
   examination as cysticerci and by molecular diagnosis as Cysticercus
   longicollis, the larval form of T crassiceps. The present report
   represents the first detection of T crassiceps in the prosimian genus
   Lemur.},

Abstract = {Three brown lemurs, Eulemur fulvus, and two black lemurs, Eulemur
   macaco, were trained to select consistently the photograph of the face
   of a known individual (KI: belonging to the same social group) when it
   was presented simultaneously with a photograph of the face of an
   unfamiliar individual (UI: belonging to another social group). After the
   learning phase, the subjects were presented with new pairs of
   photographs (KI versus UI: photographs that were not used in the
   learning phase), the same pairs presented in different associations, and
   finally pairs of photographs that were completely novel (50 different
   pairs). All the subjects selected the KI significantly more often than
   the UI under all conditions. Additional tests showed that the subjects
   preferentially selected photographs of a UI belonging to their own
   species versus a UI belonging to the other species. No preference was
   observed when the subjects were presented with two KI or with their own
   photograph associated with a UI. These results reveal that the face
   contains information allowing lemurs to discriminate familiar
   individuals from unfamiliar ones. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study

Abstract = {We analyze patterns of subchondral bone apparent density in the distal
   femur of extant primates to reconstruct differences in knee posture,
   discriminate among extant species with different locomotor preferences,
   and investigate the knee postures used by subfossil lemur species
   Hadropithecus stenognathus and Pachylemur insignis. We obtained computed
   tomographic scans for 164 femora belonging to 39 primate species. We
   grouped species by locomotor preference into knuckle-walking, arboreal
   quadruped, terrestrial quadruped, quadrupedal leaper, suspensory and
   vertical clinging, and leaping categories. We reconstructed knee posture
   using an experimentally validated procedure of determining the anterior
   extent of the region of maximal subchondral bone apparent density on a
   median slice through the medial femoral condyle. We compared subchondral
   apparent density magnitudes between subfossil and extant specimens to
   ensure that fossils did not display substantial mineralization or
   degradation. Subfossil and extant specimens were found to have similar
   magnitudes of subchondral apparent density, thereby permitting
   comparisons of the density patterns. We observed significant differences
   in the position of maximum subchondral apparent density between leaping
   and nonleaping extant primates, with leaping primates appearing to use
   much more flexed knee postures than nonleaping species. The anterior
   placement of the regions of maximum subchondral bone apparent density in
   the subfossil specimens of Hadropithecus and Pachylemur suggests that
   both species differed from leaping primates and included in their broad
   range of knee postures rather extended postures. For Hadropithecus, this
   result is consistent with other evidence for terrestrial locomotion.
   Pachylemur, reconstructed on the basis of other evidence as a committed
   arboreal quadruped, likely employed extended knee postures in other
   activities such as hindlimb suspension, in addition to occasional
   terrestrial locomotion.},

Title = {A Comparison of Auditory Brainstem Responses and Behavioral Estimates of
   Hearing Sensitivity in Lemur catta and Nycticebus coucang},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {72},

Abstract = {Primates depend on acoustic signals and cues to avoid predators, locate
   food, and share information. Accordingly, the structure and function of
   acoustic stimuli have long been emphasized in studies of primate
   behavioral and cognitive ecology. Yet, few studies have addressed how
   well primates hear such stimuli; indeed, the auditory thresholds of most
   primate, species are unknown. This empirical void is due in part to the
   logistic and economic challenges attendant on traditional behavioral
   testing methods. Technological advances have produced a safe and
   cost-effective alternative-the auditory brainstem response (ABR) method,
   which can be utilized in field conditions, on virtually any animal
   species, and without subject training. Here we used the ABR and four
   methods of threshold determination to construct audiograms for two
   strepsirrhine primates: the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) and slow
   loris (Nycticebus coucang). Next, to verify the general efficacy of the
   ABR method, we compared our results to published behaviorally-derived
   audiograms. We found that the four ABR threshold detection methods
   produced similar results, including relatively elevated thresholds but
   similarly shaped audiograms compared to those derived behaviorally. The
   ABR and behavioral absolute thresholds were significantly correlated,
   and the frequencies of best sensitivity and high-frequency limits were
   comparable. However, at frequencies <= 2 kHz, ABR thresholds were
   especially elevated, resulting in decreased agreement with behavioral
   thresholds and, in Lemur, the ABR 10-dB range starting points were more
   than 2 octaves higher than the behavioral points. Finally, a comparison
   of ABR- and behaviorally-derived audiograms from various animal taxa
   demonstrates the widespread efficacy of the ABR for estimating frequency
   of best sensitivity, but otherwise suggests caution; factors such as
   stimulus properties and threshold definition affect results. We conclude
   that the ABR method is a promising technique for estimating primate
   hearing sensitivity, but that additional data are required to explore
   its efficacy for estimating low-frequency thresholds. Am. J. Primatol.

   LO significantly affected (P<0.05) fat deposition in abdomen and leg,
   but it had no effect on neck fat deposition and Fatty Liver Score.
   Supplementation of SAE and LO had significantly reduced (P<0.05)
   cholesterol content and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) in leg meat, but it
   significantly increased (P<0.05) vitamin A and vitamin E and it had no
   effect on fat in leg meat. Supplementation of SAE and LO proved to
   change fatty acid composition in leg meat. The treatment highly
   significant increased ecosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic
   acid DHA (P<0.01), arachidonic acid and stearic acid (P<0.05), but it
   significantly reduced linolenic acid (P<0.05). In conclusion, the
   supplementation of SAE and LO reduced fat deposition in abdomen and leg,
   the content of cholesterol in meat, and it enriched EPA and DHA of meat.},

Abstract = {The Puerto Rican crested toad (Peltophryne lemur) is currently composed
   of a single wild population on the south coast of Puerto Rico and two
   captive populations founded by animals from the northern and southern
   coasts. The main factors contributing to its decline are habitat loss,
   inundation of breeding ponds during storms, and impacts of invasive
   species. Recovery efforts have been extensive, involving captive
   breeding and reintroductions, habitat restoration, construction of
   breeding ponds, and public education. To guide future conservation
   efforts, genetic variation and differentiation were assessed for the two
   captive colonies and the remaining wild population using the
   mitochondrial control region and six novel microsatellite loci. Only two
   moderately divergent mitochondrial haplotypes were found, with one fixed
   in each of the southern and northern lineages. Moderate genetic
   variation exists for microsatellite loci in all three groups. The
   captive southern population has not diverged substantially from the wild
   population at microsatellite loci (F-ST = 0.03), whereas there is little
   allelic overlap between the northern and southern lineages at five of
   six loci (F-ST > 0.3). Despite this differentiation, they are no more
   divergent than many populations of other amphibian species. As the
   northern breeding colony may not remain viable due to its small size and
   inbred nature, it is recommended that a third breeding colony be
   established in which northern and southern individuals are combined.
   This will preserve any northern adaptive traits that may exist, and
   provide animals for release in the event that the pure northern lineage
   becomes extirpated.},

Abstract = {Lemurs are notable for encompassing the range of body-size variation for
   all primates past and present-close to four orders of magnitude.
   Benefiting from the phylogenetic proximity of subfossil lemurs to
   smaller-bodied living forms, we employ allometric data from the skull to
   probe the ontogenetic bases of size differentiation and morphological
   diversity across these clades. Building upon prior pairwise comparisons
   between sister taxa, we performed the first clade-wide analyses of
   craniomandibular growth allometries in 359 specimens from 10 lemuroids
   and 176 specimens from 8 indrioids. Ontogenetic trajectories for extant
   forms were used as a criterion of subtraction to evaluate morphological
   variation, and putative adaptations among sister taxa. In other words,
   do species-level differences in skull form result from the differential
   extension of common patterns of relative growth?
   In lemuroids, a pervasive pattern of ontogenetic scaling is observed for
   facial dimensions in all genera, with three genera also sharing relative
   growth trajectories for jaw proportions (Lemur, Eulemur, Varecia).
   Differences in masticatory growth and form characterizing Hapalemur and
   fossil Pachylemur likely reflect dietary factors. Pervasive ontogenetic
   scaling characterizes the facial skull in extant Indri, Avahi, and
   Propithecus, as well as their larger, extinct sister taxa
   Mesopropithecus and Babakotia. Significant interspecific differences are
   observed in the allometry of indrioid masticatory proportions, with
   variation in the mechanical advantage of the jaw adductors and
   stress-resisting elements correlated with diet. As the growth series and
   adult data are largely coincidental in each clade, interspecific
   variation in facial form may result from selection for body-size
   differentiation among sister taxa. Those cases where trajectories are
   discordant identify potential dietary adaptations linked to variation in
   masticatory forces during chewing and biting. Although such
   dissociations highlight selection to uncouple shared ancestral growth
   patterns, they occur largely via transpositions and retention of
   primitive size-shape covariation patterns or relative growth
   coefficients. Am. J. Primatol. 72:161-172, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss,

Title = {Evaluation of Male Inter-Troop Transfer as a Mating Strategy among
   Ring-Tailed Lemurs on St. Catherines Island, USA},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {81},

Pages = {146-162},
Abstract = {One commonly cited function of dispersal is to increase mating
   opportunities. In this study, I evaluated the hypothesis that male
   inter-troop transfer is used as a mating strategy in ring-tailed lemurs,
   Lemur catta, on St. Catherines Island (SCI), Ga., USA. I measured male
   mating success and inter-troop transfer behavior across 5 years in a
   population consisting of 4 lemur groups on SCI. Data strongly supported
   dispersal as a successful mating strategy of natal males, because these
   males did not mate within their natal groups, but always mated in their
   new groups of entry. For secondary male dispersal (transfers between 2
   non-natal groups), data on 2 males collected in breeding seasons
   immediately prior to and following transfer show that their individual
   mating success measures increased following a transfer. Data revealed
   that among non-natal males, high-ranking males on SCI were more likely
   to transfer between groups than lower-ranking males, which is somewhat
   contrary to the more common trend among primates of lower-ranking males
   transferring more frequently. In sum, male primary dispersal appears to
   function as a mating strategy among male L. catta on SCI, with
   indications that secondary dispersal may also be successful at
   increasing male mating success. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {We analyzed the variations in several structural and floristic
   parameters in three habitats with differing relative abundance of two
   mouse lemur species. Microcebus murinus and M. ravelobensis, in order to
   explore possible functional links between the vegetation parameters and
   relative mouse lemur abundances. In the Ankarafantsika National Park the
   two species live in partial sympatry but occupy different parts of the
   forest in different relative abundances. Nine 50-m transects and nine
   sampling quadrats (900 m(2) each) were installed for studying structural
   and schematic vegetation profiles and the spatial distribution of all
   woody plant individuals at the three sites. The lists of common plant
   species and plant species occurring along the profiles were compared
   with known lemur food plants. A cluster analysis based on 11 habitat
   characteristics revealed that the site with highest relative abundance
   of M. ravelobensis (JBB) was distinct front the two other sires
   (JBA/JBC). Compared with JBA/JBC, JOB comprised a relatively high forest
   with a higher proportion of large trees, a higher density of but a lower
   overall density of plant individuals. Moreover, it had lower richness in
   plant species and families and a floristic composition different from
   JBA/JBC. Finally, food plant species of both lemur species were not
   equally represented among the most frequent plant species. The
   differences in relative abundance of the two mouse lemur species may be
   functionally linked to structural and floristic differences in the
   vegetation, anti these potential functional links are discussed.

Abstract = {This chapter reviews our current knowledge on vocal expression of
   emotional states in a prosimian primate group, the mouse lemurs, by
   applying a cross-taxa concept of emotion. In this concept, emotions are
   defined based on their adaptive significance. Using standardized
   ethological protocols, we were able to predictably induce changes in
   vocal expression of mouse lemurs by manipulating defined stimuli or
   situations. Whereas infants produced context-specific vocalizations
   linked to the external environment, adults additionally linked vocal
   features to the respective interaction partner. In a courtship paradigm,
   mouse lemur males showed dynamic changes in vocal expression paralleling
   the intensity of arousal evoked by the condition of females and their
   behavior. In contrast to rodents, neither vomeronasalectomy nor
   bulbectomy affected vocal production. Castration led to a decrease in
   vocal rate of a specific vocal expression. The emission of the latter,
   however, was not related to plasma testosterone in intact males.
   Altogether, the findings suggested that vocal control was more linked to
   individual social experience than to olfactory input or gonadal
   androgens. A comparison of three context-specific acoustically distinct
   vocal expressions across different mouse lemur species indicated that
   comparable vocal features were used across species to convey a
   particular individualized context, and thereby a specific appetitive or
   aversive state.
   The findings support the hypothesis that vocalizations of mouse lemurs
   express the emotional state of a signaler reliably when linked to the
   respective individualized context.},

Abstract = {Serum and whole blood samples from 64 clinically normal captive black
   and white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata), aged 6 mo to 32 yr, were
   analyzed to survey mineral and fat-soluble vitamin concentrations. All
   animals were fed a commercial primate food and a wide range of fruits
   and vegetables. Specific commercial diet information was available for
   52 animals that were fed one of 10 different diets. Data analysis showed
   no differences in the analytes, attributable to sex or access to natural
   ultraviolet light. Serum phosphorus (range: 1.4-3.1 mmol/L) was
   significantly higher and retinol (range: 0.38-1.23 mu mol/L) was
   significantly lower in young animals (<= 4 yr). Iron (range: 17.2-77.0
   mu mol/L) and copper (range: 10.7-53.3 mu mol/L) were much higher than
   concentrations reported in other free-ranging lemur species, and in some
   animals were at levels considered potentially toxic in domestic animals.
   Magnesium (range: 0.66-2.04 mmol/L), sodium (range: 111-201 mmol/L), and
   potassium (range: 2.0-6.8 mmol/L) ranged both lower and higher than
   concentrations considered adequate for a mammal, but were similar to
   concentrations reported in wild red ruffed lemurs (Varecia rubra). a
   closely related species. Selenium (range: 3.5-7.7 mu mol/L) was within
   the range expected for a mammal, but higher than concentrations reported
   in wild V. rubra. Zinc (range: 9.2-62.7 mu mol/L) was similar to
   concentrations reported in V rubra. Calcidiol (range: < 12.5-144.8
   nmol/L) and retinol (range: 0.38-2.95 mu mol/L) were both lower and
   higher than concentrations reported in V. rubra. Lower serum calcidiol
   concentration correlated with lower commercial dietary vitamin D-3.
   alpha-tocopherol (range: 1.2-17.6 alpha mol/L) and gamma-tocopherol
   (range: 0.3-3.9 mu mol/L) were within a range expected in a captive

   predictive relationship between early rightward head orientation and
   later right hand use. Data from lemurs suggest a leftward bias in hand
   preference, but there are no data on head positioning. The purpose of
   this study was to examine the relationship between head and hand
   preferences in the black and white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata
   variegata). Ruffed lemurs rotate the head vertically during chewing in a
   behavior called head-tilting. Frequency of head-tilting and bouts of
   unimanual hand use were measured during normal feeding in a
   semi-free-ranging population of lemurs. Subjects were provisioned at
   feeding platforms twice daily with fresh fruits, vegetables, and other
   food items. Sampling was spontaneous and all observations were
   videotaped. No group-level bias was found for head-tilting, but a left
   hand bias emerged for hand use. A positive relationship was found
   between direction of head-tilting preference and direction of hand use
   preference such that left head-tilts increased as left hand use
   increased. Furthermore, left head-tilts increased as the degree of hand
   preference lateralization increased. When the hand used to bring food to
   the mouth just before head-tilting was examined, there was a strong bias
   for the left hand to precede left head-tilts. For right head-tilts,
   however, lemurs were equally likely to use either hand before
   head-tilting. Overall a strong relationship was found between the left
   hand and left head-tilting in black and white ruffed lemurs, suggesting
   a common link between these behaviors. However, the direction of bias
   was different from that seen in human and chimpanzee studies. Additional
   studies on patterns of laterality would be informative for understanding
   how laterality has changed across the primate order and the adaptive
   significance of laterality in primates. Am. J. Primatol. 71:1032-1040,

Abstract = {Fallback foods are often viewed as central in shaping primate
   morphology, and influencing adaptive shifts in hominin and other primate
   evolution. Here we argue that fruit of the tamarind tree (Tamarindus
   indica) qualifies as a fallback food of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)
   at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve (BMSR), Madagascar. Contrary to
   predictions that fallback foods may select for dental and masticatory
   morphologies adapted to processing these foods, consumption of tamarind
   fruit by these lemurs leaves a distinct pattern of dental pathology
   among ring-tailed lemurs at BMSR. Specifically, the physical and
   mechanical properties of tamarind fruit likely result in a high
   frequency of severe tooth wear, and subsequent antemortem tooth loss, in
   this lemur population. This pattern of dental pathology is amplified
   among lemurs living in disturbed areas at Beza Mahafaly, resulting from
   a disproportionate emphasis on challenging tamarind fruit, due to few
   other fruits being available. This is in part caused by a reduction in
   ground cover and other plants due to livestock grazing. As such,
   tamarind trees remain one of the few food resources in many areas.
   Dental pathologies are also associated with the use of a nonendemic leaf
   resource Argemone mexicana, an important food during the latter part of
   the dry season when overall food availability is reduced. Such dental
   pathologies at Beza Mahafaly, resulting from the use or overemphasis of
   fallback foods for which they are not biologically adapted, indicate
   that anthropogenic factors must be considered when examining fallback
   foods. Am J Phys Anthropol 140:671-686, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Coat condition can be influenced by a wide variety of disorders and thus
   provides a useful tool for noninvasive health and welfare assessments in
   wild and captive animals. Using Lemur catta as an exemplar, we offer a
   6-step scoring system for coat and tail condition, ranging from
   perfectly fluffy to half or more of body and tail being hairless. The
   categories are described in detail and illustrated with sample pictures
   from a wild population in Berenty Reserve, Madagascar. Furthermore, we
   elaborate on intermediate conditions and discoloration of fur. Coat
   condition scoring allows the comparison between years, seasons, and the
   effect of toxin, disease or stress. Although this system was developed
   for wild L. catta, we believe it can also be of value for other species.
   We recommend scoring coat condition in healthy wild mammal populations
   to give a baseline on yearly and seasonal variations vs. deteriorating
   health conditions or pathology. Am. J. Primatol. 71:183-190, 2009. (c)

Abstract = {Fur condition in wild ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, was recorded
   during September-November birth seasons 2001-2006 at Berenty Reserve,
   Madagascar. Body coat condition was scored on a scale from BS 0: full,
   smooth coat with guard hairs, to BS5: half or more of back and limbs
   hairless. Tail condition was scored from TS 0: full, to TS 5: half or
   more hairless. Where troop core areas included stands of Leucaena
   leucocephala, alopecia was dramatically more frequent than in similar
   areas without leucaena, including many animals with score BS5 or TS5,
   ``bald lemur syndrome.{''} Female coats were worse than males,' possibly
   related to female dominance and access to this preferred food. Tails in
   non-leucaena-feeding females tend to remain full, even if coats
   deteriorate, but with leucaena-feeding female tails are highly
   correlated with coat condition and equally bare. Coat and tail condition
   in L. catta reflected not only the dietary toxin but individual
   differences as well as differences between adjacent troops that may
   result from territorially mediated access to the environment. Leucaena
   contains the non-protein amino acid mimosine, a known cause of alopecia,
   wasting, and organ damage in livestock, although the effects are usually
   reversible. This is the first case of its effect in wildlife. Leucaena
   is an agroforestry tree introduced throughout the tropics. In high
   dietary concentrations leucaena might potentially affect any browsing
   mammal. Am. J. Primatol. 71:199-205, 2009. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Adult strepsirrhines have been completely neglected in the study of
   animal play. I focused on adult play fighting and the role of tail-play
   as a signal in ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta). Tail-play is performed
   during play fighting, when lemurs anoint or, more rarely, wave their
   tails toward the playmate. During the prereproductive period, male and
   female lemurs engaged in play fighting with comparable frequencies, as
   was expected to occur in monomorphic species such as L. catta. The dyads
   showing low aggression rates engaged most frequently in play fighting,
   and polyadic play was frequently performed. Signals seem to be important
   in avoiding escalation to real aggression, especially when the
   playfulness of performers can be Misunderstood by recipients. Tail-play
   was most frequent (a) in the dyads with low grooming rates (low
   familiarity degree) and (b) during the most risky play sessions
   (polyadic ones). Thus, tail-play can be considered as a useful tool for
   play communication in ringtailed lemurs.},

Title = {Does simple feeding enrichment raise activity levels of captive

Abstract = {Feeding enrichment is a commonly proposed way to promote natural
   behavior, greater activity levels and improved health in captive
   primates, but in many cases the methods have not been formally tested,
   especially for particular groups such as lemurs. We investigated whether
   simple changes in food presentation could increase activity levels in
   captive ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) and reduce the removal by
   lemurs of food intended for hyrax (Procavia capensis) and porcupine
   (Hystrix cristata) (pirating) housed in the same enclosure. We varied
   two aspects of food presentation for a population of eight L catta
   housed at the Santa Ana Zoo in a repeated measures, factorial design:
   the presence or absence of browse in food boxes, and the clumping or
   spatial separation of food boxes. The number of animals in the group
   engaged indifferent categories of behaviors was recorded with scans
   every 60 s for 2 h after feeding. Neither the addition of browse (P =
   0.58) nor spatial separation of food boxes (P = 0.13) increased lemur
   activity levels in the first 70 min post-feeding, but addition of browse
   significantly raised activity in the last 50 min (P = 0.038). Adding
   browse more than doubled (to 78\%) the percentage of observation periods
   when at least one lemur was active after 70 min post-feeding and
   increased the percentage of active behaviors during that period from
   less than 4\% to over 13\%. Spatially separating food boxes reduced
   pirating (P = 0.021), but addition of browse did not(P = 0.89).
   Separating food boxes reduced pirating by nearly half. Given that these
   methods are inexpensive, easy to implement and also led to significant
   behavioral changes, simple feeding enrichment of this kind is a useful
   potential tool for captive ring-tailed lemur management. (C) 2008

Abstract = {The number of species within the Malagasy lemur genus Cheirogaleus is
   currently under debate. Museum collections are spotty, and field work,
   supplemented by morphometric and genetic analysis, is essential for
   documenting geographic distributions, ecological characteristics and
   species boundaries. We report here field evidence for 2 dwarf lemur
   species at Tsinjoarivo, an eastern-central high-altitude rain forest:
   one, from a forest fragment, displaying coat and dental characteristics
   similar to C. sibreei (previously described only from museum specimens)
   and the other, from the continuous forest, resembling individuals of
   Cheirogaleus found today at Ranomafana National Park, further to the
   south. This study represents the first confirmation of a living
   population of grey-fawn, C.-sibreei-like, dwarf lemurs in Madagascar.

Abstract = {We isolated 21 microsatellites from the Milne-Edwards' sportive lemur,
   Lepilemur edwardsi. Eighteen microsatellite sequences possessed
   sufficient flanking DNA for primer design. Seventeen loci amplified and
   were found to be polymorphic displaying two to 17 alleles in 32
   unrelated individuals from a population from the National Park of
   Ankarafantsika in northwest Madagascar. One locus (Led-12) was found to
   be sex linked located on the X chromosome and can be used to sex-type
   40\% of female L. edwardsi lemurs. These 17 loci were characterized to
   investigate family structure and the phylogeography of L. edwardsi.},

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},

Abstract = {Primates vary in their choice or avoidance of plant foods high in
   condensed tannins (CT). Our study focused on CT intake in two groups of
   Lemur catta residing in spiny forest habitat during two reproductive
   periods. We examined whether L. catta in this habitat avoided plant
   foods high in CT, and whether reproductive females ingested lower
   concentrations of CT compared with males, since CT consumption
   compromises protein absorption. Feeding data and plant food samples were
   collected during reproductive periods in 2006 (early/mid-lactation) and
   2007 (early gestation). Food samples were assayed for CT content, and
   average CT intake was determined for all focal animals. No significant
   difference was found in CT content of the most commonly consumed foods
   compared with other foods in each season or between seasons. No sex
   differences occurred in CT consumption in either reproductive period.
   These L. catta did not avoid plant foods high in CT, and three
   strategies-ingesting small amounts of CT regularly, high amounts only
   over short periods, and geophagy-may assist these lemurs in coping with
   CT content in their highly seasonal diet. L. catta may also be somewhat
   physiologically adapted to cope with CT concentrations in their plant
   foods. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Pages = {233-246},
Abstract = {In January 2005, a cyclone hit southern Madagascar, including the Beza
   Mahafaly Special Reserve, disrupting the flowering/fruiting cycle of
   Tamarindus indica, leaving Lemur catta without its major food resource
   during reproductive periods. We studied two adjacent groups of L. catta
   during the late gestation period, and both groups ventured outside the
   reserve to feed. The Red group (RG) fed daily on cultivated sweet potato
   ( Ipomoea batatas) leaves in a nearby field, and both groups consumed
   leaves and stems of the invasive terrestrial flowering herb Mexican
   prickly poppy ( Argemone mexicana), growing outside the reserve. The
   Green group (GG) spent significantly more time feeding than did RG, and
   more time feeding inside the forest compared to outside. The members of
   RG spent half of their time feeding in the crops, and nearly half of
   their diet consisted of easy-to-process sweet potato leaves.
   Additionally, RG defended and restricted GG's access to the crop
   territory. Of the two non-forest foods, A. mexicana leaves were higher
   in protein and most minerals (P, Mg, K and Na, but not Ca) and lower in
   fiber than sweet potato leaves, but sweet potato leaves were preferred
   by RG. L. catta is a markedly flexible primate with respect to diet, and
   switches to fallback foods from outside the forest during periods of low
   food availability. In the highly seasonal and unpredictable climate of
   southern Madagascar, such behavioral adaptations are important to the
   survival of this species. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Title = {Market effects offset the reciprocation of grooming in free-ranging
   redfronted lemurs, Eulemur fulvus rufus},

Abstract = {Social grooming is a commonly observed affiliative behaviour in
   primates. Grooming has been suggested to represent a service in a
   biological marketplace, exchanged either for grooming or for other
   social commodities or services. Accordingly, grooming is predicted to be
   approximately reciprocated within a dyad when no other services are
   being exchanged, but it should be more asymmetrical if partners have
   different quantities of other services to offer. We analysed 412
   grooming bouts observed in four groups of free-ranging redfronted lemurs
   to test this prediction. Grooming in this species seems to take place in
   a highly reciprocal manner because partners usually alternate in the
   roles of groomer and gromee within a grooming bout. However, within
   dyads there were asymmetries in the duration of grooming given and
   received. In both sexes, more grooming was directed from low-ranking
   towards high-ranking individuals than vice versa, and in males this
   asymmetry became more pronounced as the number of subordinates per group
   increased. Grooming in bisexual dyads was generally skewed in favour of
   males, but patterns of grooming between the sexes were less clear than
   within the sexes. In addition, aggression occurred at high frequencies
   between classes of individuals that were characterized by nonreciprocal
   grooming, suggesting that grooming may serve as a means to reduce
   aggression in dyads with a high potential for conflicts. Taken together,
   our results indicate that a strict reciprocation of grooming can be
   offset by power differentials between partners, where grooming appears
   to be traded by subordinates in exchange for the tolerance of dominants.

Title = {Phylogeny and systematics of the endoparasitic astigmatid mites (Acari:
   Sarcoptiformes) of mammals: families Gastronyssidae, Lemurnyssidae, and
   Pneumocoptidae},
Journal = {ZOOTAXA},
Year = {2008},
Number = {1951},
Pages = {1-152},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {We reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of the mammal-associated
   endoparasitic mites belonging to 3 families, Gastronyssidae (42 species
   in 9 genera), Lemurnyssidae (4 species in 2 genera), and the monogeneric
   Pneumocoptidae (4 species) on the basis of maximum parsimony analysis of
   120 morphological characters. In the strict consensus tree (all
   characters unordered and unweighted, Branch and Bound search option),
   these 3 families form a monophlyletic group with the first dichotomy
   between Pneumocoptidae-Lemurnyssidae and Gastronyssidae. The node
   joining these families is mainly supported by setal reductions. Such
   regressive characters alone provide relatively weak evidence for the
   monophyly of the group due to a greater probability of their homoplastic
   origin. On the other hand, the monophyly of each family is well
   supported by several progressive character changes. The family
   Gastronyssidae splits into 2 clusters. The first cluster represents the
   subfamily Yunkeracarinae and the second includes the subfamilies
   Gastronyssinae and Rodhoinyssinae. With respect to current
   classifications, there are 2 unexpected results in the tree: the
   position of the genus Gastronyssus Fain, 1955 (Gastronyssinae) within
   the core of the subfamily Rodhainyssinae and the polyphyly of the genus
   Opsonyssus Fain, 1959. The surprising placement of the genus
   Gastronyssus has the following explanation. In our data matrix, all
   distinctive derived character states characterizing this genus appear as
   autapomorphies and, therefore, do not affect the tree pattern. At the
   same time, these mites, being stomach parasites, exhibit the greatest
   degree of morphological reduction, including setae. Most of the
   character states shared with rodhainyssines are setal reductions and are
   of lesser reliability. The strict consensus of 14 trees obtained after
   successive weighting differs from the previous consensus tree mostly by
   the position of the genus Gastronyssus, which is the sister group to the
   all other rodhainyssine genera, excluding Phyllostomonyssus Fain, 1970.
   The genus Opsonyssus remained polyphyletic. We consider the 2 clusters
   observable in this tree as the subfamilies Yunkeracarinae (the genera
   Yunkeracarus Fain, 1957 and Sciuracarus Fain, 1964) and Gastronyssinae,
   respectively. The latter subfamily is divided onto 3 monophyletic
   lineages, which we rank as tribes: two monobasic tribes, Gastronyssini
   and Phyllostomonyssini tr. nov., and the tribe Rodhainyssini stat. nov.,
   including the remaining genera, Eidolonyssus Fain, 1967, Mycteronyssus
   Fain, 1959, Opsonyssus, Rodhainyssus Fain, 1956, and the clade O.
   striatus Fain, 1967-O. phyllorhina Fain, 1959. A new genus
   Pseudoopsonyssus gen. nov. with species P. phyllorina (Fain, 1959) comb.
   nov. (type species), P. striatus (Fain, 1967) comb. nov., and P. zumpti
   (Fain, 1959) comb. nov. is established for this clade. The host-parasite
   associations of these endoparasitic mites are discussed, and a new
   hypothesis suggesting their secondary switching from the common ancestor
   of bats to myomorph rodents is proposed. Detailed taxonomic revisions of
   all 3 families based on examination of type materials are provided.

Title = {The asymmetric scent: ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta) have distinct

Abstract = {Distinctive cues are predicted to evolve when the benefits obtained by
   the recognition process overcome its costs. When individual recognition
   is particularly beneficial for both senders and receivers, the
   expression of strongly distinctive signals is predicted to evolve. On
   the other hand, it could be predicted that each individual should show a
   very stable individual signature. In the same perspective, a great
   stability of the individual signatures could be expected. Lemur catta is
   the first non-human primate in which olfactory individual recognition
   has been demonstrated on the basis of the specialized brachial gland
   secretions. In this paper, I performed gas chromatograph analyses of
   right and left gland samples collected in two different periods
   (breeding and non-breeding seasons) from seven males. The aim was to
   verify if a diversification in such cues, already demonstrated at the
   inter-individual level, also occurs at the intra-individual level
   between left and right glands. I verified, by discriminant analysis and
   chemical distance comparisons, that each gland of each lemur has its
   particular signature that is maintained through time. Moreover, such
   diversification resulted so marked to make the overall intra-individual
   chemical differences similar to/as strong as the inter-individual ones.
   Since in rodents several odors from different glands may be integrated
   in individual recognition, I suggest that bilateral diversification in
   L. catta scents may offer an enhanced distinctiveness that could provide
   benefits in mate choice and social relationships.},

Abstract = {Sterck and colleagues (Behaviour 134:749-774, 1997) focused attention on
   the evolutionary ecology of female social relationships within and
   between groups and proposed a model that distinguishes 4 categories of
   female relationships, which correspond to particular types of intra- and
   intergroup competition. They emphasized literature on haplorhines in
   their model because of numerous, detailed studies conducted on a range
   of species in the wild; in contrast, strepsirrhines such as the
   lemuroids are poorly represented. We evaluate more closely their
   classification of lemuroids as Dispersal-Egalitarian using a greater
   number of species of Lemur, Eulemur, Varecia, Hapalemur, Indri, and
   Propithecus. For the focal species we found that female philopatry
   occurs rarely, agonistic rates are relatively low, female dominance
   hierarchies are not stable and do not exist year-round, and intra- and
   intergroup female-female competition is infrequent. Therefore, our
   results support the suggestion that a majority of lemuroid taxa we
   surveyed correspond to the Dispersal-Egalitarian category with 2
   probable exceptions: Lemur catta and Propithecus edwardsi. Because
   female Lemur catta are philopatric, have year-round dominance
   hierarchies with female matrilines, exhibit the highest rates of agonism
   in studied lemuroids, and have frequent intra- and intergroup
   female-female competition, it would seem that they more closely
   correspond to the category Resident-Nepotistic. However, maternal Lemur
   catta rarely support their offspring in agonistic contests and
   matrilineal rank is not inherited, which leads us to state that the
   species does not fit into any existing category that explains the nature
   of female social relationships. The relationships of female Propithecus
   edwardsi are also a challenge to categorize under the current model
   because some of their characteristics -typical female dispersal and low
   agonistic rates- fall into the Dispersal-Egalitarian category, yet other
   behaviors -intense targeted aggression and stable and year-round female
   dominance hierarchies- do not.},

Volume = {79},

Abstract = {Studies on leadership during group movements in several lemur species
   showed that females were responsible for the travelling choices
   concerning time and direction. Interestingly, in these species females
   are dominant over males. We investigated the influence of social
   organisation upon leadership processes by studying a lemur species in
   which social organisation is characterized by the absence of female
   dominance: the brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus fulvus). The study was
   conducted on a semi-free ranging group of 11 individuals and the
   analysis performed on 69 group movements showed that all the individuals
   could initiate a group movement. In 34 cases, the whole group moved.
   There was no significant difference in the number of start attempts or
   in the number of group members involved from one initiator to another.
   Moreover, there was no effect of sex or age of the initiator on the
   number of individuals following it or on the speed of the joining
   process. Therefore, the leadership observed is widely distributed to all
   group members. These results support the hypothesis of an influence of
   social organisation upon the decision-making processes but still remain
   to be Studied in a more relevant ecological context. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {Male dispersal patterns were analyzed across a nine-year period in a
   population of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) on St. Catherines Island
   (SCI), USA, to evaluate two ultimate explanations for male dispersal:
   inbreeding avoidance and intrasexual mating competition. As part of this
   analysis, we also compared patterns of dispersal at this site with data
   from wild populations. Overall, we found that patterns of male
   intertroop movement on SCI are similar to the wild with respect to the
   frequency and seasonality of male transfer. In Madagascar, males move
   between groups every 3.1-3.5 years {[}Sussman, International Journal of
   Primatol 13:395-413, 1992; Koyama et al., Primates 43:291-314, 2002] as
   compared with every 3.2 years on SCI. The majority of transfers on SCI
   occurred during the birth season, as occurs at one site in Madagascar,
   Berenty {[}Budnitz \& Dainis, Lemur biology. New York: Plenum Press, p
   219-235, 1975; Jones, Folia Primatologica 40:145-160, 1983]. One
   difference is that males perform natal transfers 1-2 years earlier on
   SCI than in the wild, which may be related to food provisioning on SCI.
   Males never transferred back into their natal troops, which is
   remarkable given the small number of groups on SCI. Although this
   pattern of movement can indicate inbreeding avoidance by males, the fact
   that male troop tenure was in many cases long enough to overlap with the
   sexual maturation of potential daughters did not support the inbreeding
   avoidance hypothesis for male secondary dispersal. Instead, the
   intrasexual competition hypothesis was strongly supported, because males
   were significantly more likely to transfer into groups having fewer
   adult males and a more favorable sex ratio than their pretransfer
   groups. Males therefore appear to be bypassing groups in which they
   would experience a greater degree of intrasexual mating competition
   during the breeding season.},

Abstract = {Cardiac ultrasound is a noninvasive technique that is commonly used to
   evaluate cardiac structure and function. There are no standard
   echocardiographic datas for the brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus), which is
   the most common and widespread type of this species on the island of
   Madagascar. These reference range values would nevertheless be useful in
   zoos, where echography is to become a top-grade diagnostic tool, for
   being non invasive. This study concerned 16 brown lemurs. After
   sedation, echographic examinations in two dimensionnal mode, M-Mode and
   Doppler mode were performed on the animals : The orientation of the
   heart is intermediate between that of animals possessing a clavicle and
   that of the animals which lack it. M-Mode, the fractional shortening
   (mean AD, per cent), index of left ventricular performance, is 54.63 per
   cent (standard deviation: 14.68 per cent). In Doppler mode, the mean
   aortic velocity is 0,99 m per s (standard deviation: 0,21 m per s) and
   the mean pulmonic flow velocity is 0,95 m per s (standard deviation:
   0,21 m per s). These echocardiographic values can serve as reference

Abstract = {In the present study we asked whether lemurs could learn to manipulate
   information in order to deceive a human competitive trainer. Four brown
   lemurs were trained to communicate about the location of a hidden reward
   to a cooperative trainer, who rewarded the subject if he indicated the
   baited bowl. Next, a competitive trainer was introduced who kept the
   reward for himself if the subject indicated the baited bowl. In a first
   experiment, sessions were randomly assigned to be with either the
   cooperative or competitive trainer. No subject was able to show an
   efficient tactic with both trainers. In a second experiment, the
   participation of the two trainers was randomized across the trials for
   each session. When trials were mixed, one subject significantly chose
   baited location when interacting with the cooperative trainer, and
   reliably increased his choices of the unbaited location when presented
   with the competitive trainer. As with most other primate species tested
   under the same paradigm, associative learning may explain deceptive
   pointing by lemurs in this study.},

Abstract = {Complete health assessments were performed on 22 adult red ruffed lemurs
   (Varecia rubra), comprising nine males and 13 females, found within the
   Masoala National Park in northeast Madagascar. Each animal was
   anesthetized using tiletamine and zolazepam and underwent a thorough
   physical examination, including measurement of its weight and vital
   signs; blood collection for hematology, plasma total protein
   concentration, serum chemistries, fat-soluble vitamins, trace minerals,
   assessment of iron metabolism, toxoplasmosis serology, viral serologies,
   and examination for hemoparasites; fecal collection for bacterial
   culture and parasite examination; and collection of a representative
   number of any ectoparasites. Comparison of blood values with those of
   captive lemurs demonstrated a number of significant differences thought
   to be associated with physiologic state (e.g., reproductive stage and
   stress), hydration, and diet. There was no evidence of serious
   infectious diseases, and hemoparasites were not detected. The enteric
   flora appeared unremarkable; however, results may have been skewed
   toward more cold-tolerant bacteria. The fecal parasite burden was low.
   Lemurostrongylus spp. was identified in two of the lemurs, and there
   were moderate numbers of Laelapidae mites present on approximately one
   third of the lemurs. This study demonstrated the substantial amount of
   data that can be collected from free-ranging populations, considered
   invaluable in the management of captive populations, in reducing the
   incidence of captivity-related diseases, and in the risk assessment

Abstract = {The sensory bases of food detection, food location and food choice in
   nocturnal primates are poorly understood. Grey mouse lemurs, Microcebus
   murinus, are omnivorous nocturnal strepsirhines and generally regarded a
   good model for the most ancestral primate condition. We set up a series
   of choice experiments in a controlled laboratory environment to
   investigate the roles of acoustic, olfactory and visual cues and the
   importance of unimodal versus multimodal cues for prey perception in
   this species. Subjects in our study were able to find hidden prey better
   than expected by chance using any of the three sensory modalities
   tested; that is, any of the cues provided was sufficient and none was
   indispensably necessary to trigger prey detection. Availability of
   visual cues alone enabled successful prey detection in > 90\% of trials.
   Detection performance increased with the number of modalities available.
   Taken together, our data identify vision as a key modality for prey
   detection in captive-born grey mouse lemurs and at the same time stress
   the role of multimodal information for successful foraging in this
   nocturnal primate. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {A survey to identify the major intestinal species of aerobic bacteria,
   protozoa and helminths was conducted on captive and wild populations of
   ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). Samples were collected from 50 captive
   lemurs at 11 zoological institutions in the United States. In
   Madagascar, 98 aerobic bacteria samples and 99 parasite samples were
   collected from eight sites chosen to cover a variety of populations
   across the species range. Identical collection, preservation and lab
   techniques were used for captive and wild populations. The predominant
   types of aerobic bacteria flora were identified via five separate tests.
   The tests for parasites conducted included flotation, sedimentation and
   FA/GC. Twentyseven bacteria unique to either the captive or wild
   populations were cultured with eight of these being statistically
   significantly different. Fourteen bacteria common to both populations
   were cultured, of which six differed significantly. Entamoeba colt was
   the only parasite common to both the captive and wild populations.
   Giardia spp., Isospora spp., strongyles-type ova, Entamoeba spp. and
   Entamoeba polecki were found only in captive samples. Cryptosporidium,
   Balantidium colt, pinworm-type ova, and two fluke-like ova were seen
   only in wild samples. In addition, samples were compared for both
   bacteria and parasites from three unique field sites in Madagascar. In
   this three-site comparison, six types of bacteria were statistically
   significantly different. No significant differences regarding parasites
   were seen. Significant differences were found between the captive and
   wild populations, whereas fewer differences were found between sites
   within Madagascar. Although we isolated Campylobacter and Giardia, all
   animals appeared clinically healthy.},

Title = {Evaluating effects of deforestation, hunting, and El Nino events on a
   threatened lemur},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {141},
Number = {1},
Pages = {287-297},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Madagascar ranks as one of the world's top extinction hotspots because
   of its high endemism and high rate of habitat degradation. Global
   climate phenomena such as El Nino Southern Oscillations may have
   confounding impacts on the island's threatened biota but these effects
   are less well known. We performed a demographic study of Propithecus
   edwardsi, a lemur inhabiting the eastern rainforest of Madagascar, to
   evaluate the impact of deforestation, hunting, and El Nino on its
   population and to re-evaluate present endangerment categorization under
   the IUCN. Over 18 years of demographic data, including survival and
   fecundity rates were used to parameterize a stochastic population model
   structured with three stage classes (yearlings, juveniles, and adults).
   Results demonstrate that hunting and deforestation are the most
   significant threats to the population. Analysis of several plausible
   scenarios and combinations of threat revealed that a 50\% population
   decline within three generations was very likely, supporting current
   IUCN classification. However, the analysis also suggested that changing
   global cycles may pose further threat. The average fecundity of lemurs
   was over 65\% lower during El Nino years. While not as severe as
   deforestation or hunting, if El Nino events remain at the current high
   frequency there may be negative consequences for the population. We
   suggest that it is most critical for this species continued survival to
   create more protected areas, not only to thwart hunting and
   deforestation, but also to give this endangered lemur a better chance to
   recover from and adapt to altered climate cycles in the future. (C) 2007

Abstract = {In 1999, we measured the body mass of 101 wild ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur

   counted the number of ticks {[}Haemaphysalis (Rhipistoma) lemuris

   meatuses. For both males and females, the body mass appeared to increase
   until the age of 3 years. With the apparent exception of infants, there
   were no sexual differences in body mass. Within a group, higher-ranked
   adult males tended to be heavier than lower-ranked males. In contrast,
   there was no consistent correlation between the body mass of females and
   their ranks. Among the study groups, there was a small difference in
   body mass and significant difference in the number of ticks infesting
   the facial skin and external auditory meatuses. In particular, lemurs of
   a group who inhabited an area of gallery forest in the study area
   exhibited the smallest values of body mass and were severely infested
   with ticks. Such group variations were not consistently correlated with
   the reproductive parameters of the study groups. In three groups
   moderately infested with ticks, ticks infested adult males and subadults
   more heavily than adult females, juveniles, and infants.},

Title = {Variation in fecal testosterone levels, inter-male aggression, dominance
   rank and age during mating and post-mating periods in wild adult male
   ring-tailed Lemurs (Lemur catta)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {69},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In primate species exhibiting seasonal reproduction, patterns of
   testosterone excretion in adult males are variable: in some species,
   peaks correlate with female receptivity periods and heightened male-male
   aggression over access to estrous females, in others, neither heightened
   aggression nor marked elevations in testosterone have been noted. In
   this study, we examined mean fecal testosterone ( f T) levels and
   intermale aggression in wild adult male ring-tailed lemurs residing in
   three groups at Beza Mahafaly Reserve, Madagascar. Results obtained from
   mating and post-mating season 2003 were compared to test Wingfield et
   al. {[}1990. Am Nat 136:829-846] ``challenge hypothesis{''}, which
   predicts a strong positive relationship between male testosterone levels
   and male-male competition for access to receptive females during
   breeding season. f T levels and rates of intermale aggression were
   significantly higher during mating season compared to the post-mating
   period. Mean f T levels and aggression rates were also higher in the
   first half of the mating season compared with the second half. Number of
   males in a group affected rates of intermale agonism, but not mean f T
   levels. The highest-ranking males in two of the groups exhibited higher
   mean f T levels than did lower-ranking males, and young males exhibited
   lower f IT levels compared to prime-aged and old males. In the
   post-mating period, mean male f T levels did not differ between groups,
   nor were there rank or age effects. Thus, although male testosterone
   levels rose in relation to mating and heightened male-male aggression, f
   T levels fell to baseline breeding levels shortly after the early mating
   period, and to baseline non-breeding levels immediately after mating
   season had ended, offsetting the high cost of maintaining both high
   testosterone and high levels of male-male aggression in the early
   breeding period.},

Abstract = {The population of brown lemurs has rapidly grown since their founders
   were introduced to the Berenty Reserve. The founders consist of two
   species (Eulemur fulvus rufus and E. collaris). To characterize the
   behavior of the population and to examine whether these characteristics
   affect population growth, I investigated the habitat use and social
   structure of the population of brown lemurs at Berenty (Berenty
   Eulemur). Behavior data were collected focusing on horizontal and
   vertical habitat use, activity rhythms, and intergroup relationships.
   These data were compared with the data of E. fulvus in other areas, with
   the previous studies done at Berenty, and with data on Berenty Lemur
   catta. Berenty Eulemur maintained a home range size comparable to E. f.
   rufus in. the western deciduous dry forest, but was found at a lower
   level of the forest and had larger overlapping home ranges. Berenty
   Eulemur use food resources earlier in the morning than L. catta,
   intergroup conflict was avoided by vocal communication, and Berenty
   Eulemur made suitable use of their limited habitat. I suggest that a
   number of behavioral characteristics of Berenty Eulemur may contribute
   to their population growth.},

   of a variety of caveolin isoforms in many layers of the lemur retina. As
   normal human retinas were not available for research and the retinas of
   primates are fairly similar to those of humans, the lemur retina can be
   utilized as a model for caveolin distribution in normal humans.},

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {In this paper, we aim at demonstrating individual recognition of female
   genital marking in Lemur catta. By gas chromatography and behavioural
   trials we verified the occurrence of the three components of recognition
   systems. We showed that each female has a unique chemical signature (
   expression component), and males and females perceive female
   individuality ( perception component). To verify the presence of the
   action component ( the last component of recognition systems), we
   designed a bioassay based on territorial competition to verify the
   functional response to female odours. Only females identified other
   females on the basis of their scents. The lack of a territorial
   functional response by males to female secretions may not indicate a
   male inability to identify females by their scents. In fact, sexual
   dimorphism in motivation and territorial defence may explain the
   response by males in the functional experiment. Actually, game theory
   predicts that males defend their own territories more vigorously against
   males compared with females. Therefore, the result of individual
   recognition bioassays of female odours may open interesting scenarios in
   the evaluation of the territorial defence investment across the
   different sex combinations.},

Abstract = {Contraception is a critical component of population management for
   lemurs, but concerns about potential deleterious effects of continuous,
   long-term treatment with synthetic progestins such as the widely used
   melengestrol acetate implant led us to evaluate seasonal contraception
   with injections of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera,
   Upjohn Pharmacia, Kalamazoo, MI) to limit the duration of exposure. We
   compared two dosage regimens in female black lemurs using vaginal
   cytology as an indirect measure of ovarian suppression. Our results
   indicate that both 10 mg/kg body weight at 90-day intervals or 2.5 mg/kg
   at approximately 30-day intervals can be effective in most females,
   although one female on the 10-mg dose showed signs of estrus at 53 days.
   Darkening of pelage during treatment was the primary side effect noted.
   A more important observation was that contraception can extend the
   breeding season to as much as 9 months, considerably longer than
   reported previously, which necessitates extending the period of
   contraceptive treatment.},

Abstract = {Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions were analyzed from hair
   samples of 30 sympatric ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) inhabiting the
   Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar. All lemurs were known
   individuals involved in a longitudinal study, which allowed us to
   explore the degree to which group membership, sex, health status, and
   migration influenced their stable isotope compositions. The differences
   in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values between groups were small (< 1.5
   parts per thousand) but highly significant. In fact, each group was
   tightly clustered, and discriminant function analysis of the stable
   isotope data assigned individuals to the group in which they were
   originally collared with over 90\% accuracy. In general, the differences
   between groups reflected the degree to which they utilized forested
   versus open habitats. As open habitats at Beza Mahafaly often correspond
   to areas of anthropogenic disturbance, these data suggest that isotopic
   data can be useful for addressing questions of lemur conservation. There
   were few sex differences, but significant differences did occur between
   individuals of normal and suboptimal health, with those in poor health
   (especially those in the worst condition) being enriched in N-15 and to
   a lesser degree C-13 compared with healthy individuals. Moreover, lemurs
   that had emigrated between 2003 and 2004 had different delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 compositions than their original groups.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Lemurs are a diverse group of primates comprised of five families, all
   of which are found only on Madagascar and the Comoro Islands. Of the 60
   known species, 17 are endangered and 5 of these are considered
   critically endangered. The effects of inbreeding on population health
   and viability have been well described; though negative inbreeding
   effects can be ameliorated through the introduction of new genetic
   material. Introduction of new individuals into a population can be
   extremely challenging because of the highly social nature of lemurs.
   Semen collection in lemur species is notoriously challenging, as the
   ejaculate forms a coagulum. During normal breeding, the coagulum forms a
   copulatory plug in the female. However, this coagulum can present a
   life-threatening situation when retained in the urethra abnormally
   following electroejaculation. This study investigates the use of
   ascorbic acid in preventing urethral blockage in two lemur species
   during semen collection, demonstrates successful collection of semen by
   electroejaculation from two species of lemur during the breeding season,
   and discusses removal of urethral plugs subsequent to semen collection.
   Semen was collected successfully from all animals. Urethral plugs formed
   during each collection and were abnormally retained in 2/11 collections.
   Both plugs were successfully and immediately removed with the use of
   retropulsion through a urethral catheter. Although the results of this
   study are encouraging, more investigation is required to establish
   whether or not this procedure can be safely performed in the field.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {69},
Number = {6},
Pages = {611-624},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although about one-third of all primate species are nocturnal, their
   antipredator behavior has rarely been studied directly. Crypsis and a
   solitary lifestyle have traditionally been considered to be the main
   adaptive antipredator strategies of nocturnal primates. However, a
   number of recent studies have revealed that nocturnal primates are not
   as cryptic and solitary as previously suggested. Thus, the antipredator
   strategies available for diurnal primates that rely on early detection
   and warning of approaching predators may also be available to nocturnal
   species. In order to shed additional light on the antipredator
   strategies of nocturnal primates, I studied pair-living red-tailed
   sportive lemurs (Lepilemur ruficaudatus) in Western Madagascar. In an
   experimental field study I exposed adult sportive lemurs that lived in
   pairs and had offspring to playbacks of vocalizations of their main
   aerial and terrestrial predators, as well as to their own mobbing calls
   (barks) given in response to disturbances at their tree holes. I
   documented the subjects' immediate behavioral responses, including alarm
   calls, during the first minute following a playback. The sportive lemurs
   did not give alarm calls in response to predator call playbacks or to
   playbacks with barks. Other behavioral responses, such as gaze and
   escape directions, corresponded to the hunting strategies of the two
   classes of predators, suggesting that the corresponding vocalizations
   were correctly categorized. In response to barks, they scanned the
   ground and fled. Because barks do not indicate any specific threats,
   they are presumably general alarm calls. Thus, sportive lemurs do not
   rely on early warning of acoustically simulated predators; rather, they
   show adaptive escape strategies and use general alarm calls that are
   primarily directed toward the predator but may also serve to warn kin
   and pair-partners.},

Abstract = {Because ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) show handedness during feeding,
   I investigated whether they also show lateral preference in the limbs

   included six wild and four group-living captive male lemurs. I
   considered limb usage to be lateralized for each individual lemur if the
   frequency of use of one side was significantly above chance as
   determined by binomial z-scores at P < .05. I measured consistency of
   lateral preference by calculating handedness index (HI) scores for each
   individual. Overall, I recorded 1,583 bouts of scent marking, and 66\%
   of the bouts began with shoulder rubbing. Eight of the 10 males showed a
   significant, moderately strong lateral preference for the lead limb in
   the first shoulder rub performed in a bout, and for six of these eight
   the preferred lead limb for shoulder rubbing was the left one. Six of
   the 10 males showed a significant but weak lateral preference in the
   first arm mark, and five of these preferred the opposite limb to that
   used for the first shoulder rub. Although the preferences were not at
   the population level, eight of the 10 lemurs showed a lateral bias in
   the lead limb used for a component of this complex social signal.},

Abstract = {Complete physical examinations and biomedical sample collection were
   performed on 70 free-ranging ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) from three
   different habitats in the Beza Mahfaly Special Reserve (BMSR), in
   southern Madagascar, to assess the impact of humans and habitat on lemur
   health. Lemurs were chemically immobilized with ketamine and diazepam
   administered via blow darts for concurrent biomedical, morphometric, and
   behavioral studies. Subsets of the animals had blood analyzed for
   hematology, serum chemistry, micronutrients, fat-soluble vitamins
   (vitamins A, D, and E), measures of iron metabolism, and polymerase
   chain reaction assays (PCR) for Toxoplasma gondii, Hemoplasma spp.,
   Bartonella spp., Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and
   Neorickettsia risticii. Results were compared on the basis of gender and
   the habitats at the study site: reserve (intact gallery forest),
   degraded (human inhabited and altered), and marginal (dry didieracea
   forest with heavy grazing and tree cutting). Levels of vitamin D,
   triglycerides, and cholesterol, and measures of iron metabolism for BMSR
   lemurs were greater than those previously reported for a free-ranging
   lemur population (Tsimanampetsotsa Strict Nature Reserve, Madagascar)
   with less access to foods of anthropogenic origin. BMSR ring-tailed
   lemurs from a habitat with less water (marginal) had higher sodium (P =
   0.051), chloride (P = 0.045), osmolality (P = 0.010), and amylase (P =
   0.05) levels than lemurs from other BMSR habitats, suggesting that these
   lemurs were less hydrated. Vitamin D levels of male lemurs were higher
   (P = 0.011) than those of females at BMSR, possibly because of
   differences in sunning behavior or differential selection of food items.
   The biological significance is uncertain for other parameters with
   statistically significant differences. All samples tested (n = 20) were
   negative for the pathogens tested using PCR assays. Continued concurrent
   biomedical and ecological research is needed at BMSR to confirm these
   results and determine their association with population mortality and
   fecundity rates.},

Abstract = {Mouse lemurs (genus Microcebus) are nocturnal primates endemic to the
   island of Madagascar. Until recently, they were classified as two
   species, one from eastern and one from western Madagascar. Previously
   published analyses of morphometric and mitochondrial DNA data show
   strong support for the recognition of more than eight species, however.
   Here, we test the eight-species hypothesis with DNA data derived from
   four independently segregating nuclear loci. We find many areas of
   congruence between the mitochondrial and nuclear data, but incomplete
   lineage sorting and low mutation rates limit the phylogenetic resolution
   of the nuclear data. Even so, the nuclear loci unanimously find evidence
   for three deeply diverged lineages within the mouse lemur radiation: one
   that is congruent with the mtDNA ``southern clade{''}, another that is
   congruent with the mtDNA ``northern clade{''}, and one monospecific
   branch comprised of the species Microcebus ravelobensis. The latter
   result in particular emphasizes the need for careful biological study of
   this species. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Sex and seasonal differences in aggression and steroid secretion in
   Lemur catta: Are socially dominant females hormonally `masculinized'?},
Journal = {HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Female social dominance characterizes many strepsirrhine primates
   endemic to Madagascar, but currently there is no comprehensive
   explanation for how or why female lemurs routinely dominate males.
   Reconstructing the evolutionary pressures that may have shaped female
   dominance depends on better understanding the mechanism of inheritance,
   variation in trait expression, and correlating variables. Indeed,
   relative to males, many female lemurs also display delayed puberty, size
   monomorphism, and `masculinized' external genitalia. As in the spotted
   hyena (Crocuta crocuta), a species characterized by extreme
   masculinization of the female, this array of traits focuses attention on
   the role of androgens in female development. Consequently, I examined
   endocrine profiles and social interaction in the ringtailed lemur (Lemur
   catta) to search for a potential source of circulating androgen in adult
   females and an endocrine correlate of female dominance or its proxy,
   aggression. I measured serum androstenedione (A(4)), testosterone (T),
   and estradiol (E-2) in reproductively intact, adult lemurs (10 females;
   12 males) over four annual cycles. Whereas T concentrations in males far
   exceeded those in females, A(4) concentrations were only slightly
   greater in males than in females. In both sexes, A(4) and T were
   positively correlated, implicating the Delta(4)-biosynthetic pathway.
   Moreover, seasonal changes in reproductive function in both sexes
   coincided with seasonal changes in behavior, with A(4) and T in males
   versus A(4) and E-2 in females increasing during periods marked by
   heightened aggression. Therefore, A4 and/or E2 may be potentially
   important steroidal sources in female lemurs that could modulate
   aggression and underlie a suite of masculinized features. (c) 2007

Abstract = {Complete medical evaluations were performed on 25 wild black lemurs
   (Eulemur macaco macaco) in Lokobe Reserve, northwestern Madagascar. Each
   animal received a complete physical examination. Weight, body
   temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were recorded. Blood
   samples were collected for complete blood cell count, differential white
   blood cell count, hemoparasite examination, serum biochemical profile,
   fat-soluble vitamin analysis, trace mineral analysis, and Toxoplasma
   gondii and viral serology. Fecal samples were collected for bacterial
   culture and endoparasite examination. Ectoparasites were collected and
   identified. Values were compared to established ranges from captive
   black lemurs in North American zoos. Significant differences exist
   between captive and wild animals for total white blood cell count,
   segmented neutrophil count, band neutrophil count, eosinophil count,
   monocyte count, and basophil count, and for serum biochemistry values of
   aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin,
   serum alkaline phosphatase, total protein, creatinine, phosphorus,
   calcium, sodium, potassium, and creatine phosphokinase. One animal had a
   positive Toxoplasma titer. Detected endoparasites were identified as
   Lemuricolo and Callistroura. Two ectoparasite mites were identified, one
   within the Psoroptes genus and one within the Laelapidae family. Enteric
   bacterial flora included Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp.,
   Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Klebsiella ozaenae and Bacillus

Abstract = {Primary renal tumors are rare neoplasms in nonhuman primates. This
   report describes a mixed epithelial and stromal tumor of the kidney
   (MESTK) in a 14.5-year-old female ringtail lemur. The well-demarcated,

   consisted histologically of both epithelial and mesenchymal components.
   The mesenchymal cells were arranged in fascicles around cysts lined by a
   well-differentiated epithelium. Neither the mesenchymal nor the
   epithelial parts showed significant nuclear atypia or mitotic figures.
   To our knowledge, only I similar case, classified as
   adenoleiomyofibromatous hamartoma, has been reported in a ringtail
   lemur. In humans this tumor affects predominantly perimenopausal women
   and can express estrogen and progesterone receptors. However, neither
   estrogen nor progesterone receptors could be identified by
   immunohistochemistry in the tumor of the present ringtail lemur.

Abstract = {The function of olfactory signalling in social species is less well
   understood than in asocial species. Consequently, we examined olfactory
   communication in the ringtailed lemur, a socially complex primate that
   retains a functional vomeronasal organ, has well-developed scent glands
   and shows a suite of scent-marking behaviour. To assess the information
   content of different types of scent gland secretions, we decoupled
   olfactory cues from the visual and behavioural modalities with which
   scent marking is normally associated. We presented male and female
   subjects (signal receivers) with a series of choice tests between odours
   derived from conspecific donors (signal senders) varying by sex, age,
   social status and reproductive condition. We additionally examined the
   influence of the receivers' reproductive state and familiarity with the
   signaller. The reproductive condition, social status and familiarity of
   senders and receivers affected signal transmission; specifically, male
   receivers attended most to the odours of conspecifics in breeding
   condition and to the odours of familiar, dominant animals. By contrast,
   females varied their responses according to both their own reproductive
   state and that of the sender. Based on male and female patterns of
   countermarking, we suggest that scent marking serves a function in
   intergroup spacing and intrasexual competition for both sexes, as might
   be expected in a female-dominant species. By contrast, minimal female
   interest in male odours counters a female mate choice function for scent
   marking in this species. Nevertheless, scent marks are critical to
   male-male competition and, therefore, may be subject to sexual
   selection. (c) 2006 The Association for the study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {Objective To determine the incidence and describe the characteristics of
   cataracts and other ocular lesions found in two colonies of gray mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus murinus).
   Animals studied A total number of 218 mouse lemurs (age range: 4
   months-11 years) were included in this study. All individuals were
   property of the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (France), and were
   housed either in Paris (colony \#1: 75 animals examined), or in Brunoy
   (colony \#2: 143 animals).
   Methods Ocular examinations were performed on all animals before and
   after pupil dilation, and included slit-lamp biomicroscopy and indirect
   ophthalmoscopy. In both colonies, a limited number of individuals were
   re-examined between several months and 2 years following the initial eye
   examinations. The eyes of five mouse lemurs with incipient or immature
   cataracts that died during this period were collected, and processed for
   routine histopathologic examination.
   Results A high incidence of cataracts was observed in both colonies
   (48\% in colony \#1; 21\% in colony \#2). Cataracts were predominantly
   bilateral, started in the anterior and/or posterior subcapsular area,
   and appeared to be slowly progressive. The earliest age at which lens
   opacities were observed was 3.5 years, and more than 50\% of mouse
   lemurs over 7 years of age were diagnosed with cataracts. Complete
   cataracts led to blindness and were occasionally associated with other
   ocular lesions.
   Conclusion We report a high incidence of acquired, slowly progressive,
   bilateral cataracts in two colonies of mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   murinus). Further studies need to be conducted to determine the cause of
   this disease in this species.},

Abstract = {The ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) is an endangered species found in
   Southwestern Madagascar, and understanding infectious disease
   susceptibility is an essential step towards the preservation of-wild and
   captive lemur populations. Lemurs are primates that are widely dispersed
   throughout the island of Madagascar and may serve as hosts or reservoirs
   for zoonotic infections. The aim of this study was to determine the
   prevalence of antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV), simian
   immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in
   a population of free-ranging ring-tailed lemur from the Beza Mahafaly
   Special Reserve, Madagascar. Samples were collected from 50 animals
   dining field capture studies in June and July 2004 and assayed for
   presence of viral antibodies during the 12 mo following collection.
   Forty-seven of the 50 lemurs sampled had antibodies against WNV
   detectable by epitope-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA). In addition, 50 of 50 samples had titers against WNV ranging
   from 80 to >= 1,280 using plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT90).
   Ten lemurs had antibodies against lentiviral antigens as determined by
   Western blot analysis. None of the lemurs had antibodies against HSV-1
   using ELISA.},

Abstract = {Altmann {[}Baboon Mothers and Infants, University of Chicago Press,
   1980] and Dunbar and Dunbar {[}Animal Behavior 36:970-980, 1988]
   provided a model that predicts the amount of time spent feeding by
   lactating baboon females, as related to infant age. Dunbar's model
   further suggests that food quality affects the amount of time that
   females devote to feeding activity, and is predictable from rainfall and
   temperature data. In this study the model was tested with data recorded
   from births of the Mayotte brown lemur from four maternal dyads (Eulemur
   fulvus). This study also examines the correlation between female
   activity budget, quantities of fresh plant matter ingested, and suckling
   duration using data collected from focal animal samples on the
   mother-infant dyads. The relationships among rainfall, food supply, and
   food quality were also tested. It appears that female brown lemurs do
   not devote more time to feeding during the infant growth period. The
   data show that female brown lemurs increased their food intake during
   the early-lactating period when the frequency of suckling is the
   highest, and before infants begin to eat substantial amounts of solid
   foods. Thus, the frequency of feeding reflects the cost of lactation
   better than suckling duration. Furthermore, females did not appear to
   select foods according to their availability or rainfall levels. I
   hypothesize that the lack of convergence between lemur data and baboon
   observations is due to differences between their respective environments
   and their feeding ecology. These data also indicate that the most
   significant lactating cost for the brown lemur occurs during the early
   lactation period.},

Abstract = {The Fandriana-Marolambo forest corridor is one of the largest (ca.
   250,000 ha) and least explored tracts of unprotected forest in southeast
   Madagascar. Although published range maps show continuous distributions
   for many lemurs throughout the region, there are few data on lemur
   community structure in the corridor. We aimed to determine lemur
   community structure, with its ecological correlates (altitude,
   agriculture, selective logging, and hunting), in the Fandriana-Marolambo
   forest corridor. We surveyed 7 sites and sighted 4 nocturnal taxa (Avahi
   laniger, Cheirogaleus major, Lepilemur mustelinus, and Microcebus rufus)
   and 6 diurnal taxa (Eulemur rubriventer, E. fulvus rufus, E. f. fulvus,
   Propithecus diadema edwardsi, Hapalemur griseus griseus, and Varecia
   variegata variegata). Composition of the lemur community was broadly
   similar to that of nearby protected areas (Ranomafana and Mantadia
   National Parks). However, we sighted no Hapalemur aureus, H. simus, or
   Indri indri, and observed Propithecus diadema edwardsi and Varecia
   variegata variegata at only 1 site each. We sighted an apparent hybrid
   form of Eulemur fulvus fulvus and E. f. rufus that may represent a new
   hybrid zone for lemurs. After testing for spatial autocorrelation, lemur
   diversity correlates negatively with altitude and agricultural
   intensity. Though the Government of Madagascar is assessing the corridor
   as a new national park, we suggest conservation plans for local lemurs
   are complicated by population isolation and lack of data on minimum
   viable size of the proposed protected area.},

Abstract = {The Malayan flying lemur (Cynocephalus variegatus) is a nocturnal
   mammalian arboreal folivore that inhabits the forests of Southeast Asia.
   Surveys were conducted from August to November 2003 to estimate the
   population density of Malayan flying lemurs for the first time in the
   Singapore Zoological Gardens. The study area consisting of Singapore Zoo
   and Night Safari was located in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve,
   where most of Singapore's remaining natural forest is found. The Zoo
   consisted of 28 ha of landscaped habitat and the adjacent Night Safari
   consisted of 40 ha of secondary rainforest. The density estimates of
   flying lemurs in the Zoo and Night Safari were 15 and 24 individuals
   respectively. Seven plant species that were the preferred food items and
   an additional 10 plants that were common in the sites but not eaten by
   the flying lemurs were analysed to compare the mineral and phytochemical
   contents. Flying lemurs consumed leaves containing significantly less
   potassium and nitrogen but higher tannin (p < 0.05). The study shows
   that flying lemurs are able to survive in altered and fragmented
   landscapes. Conservation and management strategies are essential to
   protect the shrinking habitats in Singapore.},

Abstract = {The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is the most polymorphic
   genetic system known in vertebrates. Decades of research demonstrate
   that it plays a critical role in immune response and disease resistance.
   It has also been suggested that MHC genes influence social behavior and
   reproductive phenomena. Studies in laboratory mice and rats report that
   kin recognition and mate choice are influenced by olfactory cues
   determined at least in part by an individual's MHC genes. This issue has
   stimulated intense but controversial research. However, work in this
   field has only been carried out in rodents and humans. Thus far, no
   study has directly investigated the relationship between olfactory cues
   and MHC genotype in nonhuman primates. Furthermore, other genetic loci,
   including those linked to the MHC, have not been ruled out as the
   primary influence on odor profiles. To explore the relationship between
   individual odor profiles and MHC alleles, we are studying ring-tailed
   lemurs (Lemur catta). These animals are an ideal model species because
   they are extremely scent-oriented and their behaviors suggest that
   olfactory signals form an important part of their intra- and intergroup
   communication systems. Individual odor profiles from tail and scent
   gland samples were generated for six males using gas chromatography mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS). MHC genotypes were identified using polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).
   The GC-MS analyses demonstrated a difference between profiles obtained
   from tail and scent gland samples. Although our sample size is
   relatively small and statistical significance could not be obtained, our
   analyses suggest a relationship between MHC and concentrations of
   volatile compounds. While these results are preliminary, they support
   the need for further studies of the MHC and olfactory signals in lemurs
   and other primates.},

Abstract = {The current study demonstrates, for the first time, the occurrence of
   olfactory individual recognition in a nonhuman primate species. The
   empirical demonstration of recognition systems requires 1) a set of cues
   produced by the sender (expression component), 2) the perception of
   these cues by the receiver (perception component), and 3) a functional
   response by the receiver (action component). On the basis of this
   framework, we analyzed by gas chromatography 35 brachial secretions
   collected from 10 males of Lemur catta. Moreover, we performed
   habituation/discrimination tests to demonstrate the perception
   component, and we designed a specific bioassay, based on territorial
   competition, to highlight a functional response to individual odors. We
   demonstrated that recognition of conspecific odors goes beyond the
   perception of cues other than individuality (familiarity, kin, season,
   age, and rank) and that the receiver actually forms a mental
   representation of a specific individual by its scent.},

Year = {2006},
Volume = {68},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Lemurs kept in captivity have been reported to be highly prone to
   accumulate excessive amounts of iron in tissues (hemosiderosis).
   Diagnosis of the condition is most commonly made during a postmortem
   examination because an antemortem diagnosis requires a liver biopsy, a
   procedure that may not be well tolerated by all animals. The lack of a
   noninvasive method to evaluate iron status in captive lemurs limits
   investigators' ability to effectively screen animals for the presence of
   hemosiderosis, and to detect the condition early when treatment
   protocols are most effective. This study was conducted in an effort to
   provide data regarding iron analyte values in healthy captive lemurs of
   multiple species. The relationship of various iron-related metabolites
   was evaluated in 177 clinically normal lemurs of nine different species.
   Serum iron (sI), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritin
   concentration were measured directly and the percent transferrin
   saturation (TS) was calculated. Significant differences in various iron
   metabolites were observed among several species, suggesting that normal
   reference values for iron metabolites in lemurs may need to be developed
   on a species by species basis.},

Volume = {68},

Abstract = {Significant concern has been generated about the susceptibility of
   captive lemurs to iron storage disease, which has led some researchers
   to propose husbandry changes regarding dietary iron. In the current
   study we sought to determine the history, severity, and prevalence of
   iron storage disease within a large captive lemur population. Iron
   concentration and hemosiderin accumulation in a target organ, the liver,
   were assessed in necropsy specimens from 15 different species (n = 153)
   of lemurs over a 12-yr period at the Duke University Primate Center.
   Banked liver tissue was used to quantify liver iron concentration (LIC)
   via neutron activation analysis (NAA). Prussian blue staining was used
   to accentuate the presence of liver iron for evaluation using an
   established scoring system. Of the 153 reports examined, 49 (32\%) of
   the animals were considered positive for the presence of hemosiderin in
   the liver, lymph node, duodenum, and kidney, with 36 of the 49 (73\%)
   showing deposition of iron in the liver. Total iron scores (TIS) ranged
   from 0.3 +/- 0.3 in Lemur catta to 33.3 +/- 1.7 in Cheirogaleus medius.
   The mean LIC ranged from 209 +/- 1.4 mu g/g wet weight in L. catta to
   2957 +/- 414 mu g/g in C. medius. Management practices may have
   contributed to some of the results observed in this study. Although
   evidence of excess iron deposition in the liver was present across
   several species studied, the levels were not as pervasive as previously
   reported in other captive lemur populations. Hemochromatosis was not
   observed, and excess iron was not related to the cause of death in any
   of the animals studied. The current findings suggest that iron overload
   in lemurs may be more complex than was previously believed.},

Abstract = {Dispersed pair-living primates provide a unique model for illuminating
   the evolution of mechanisms regulating spacing and cohesiveness in
   permanently cohesive groups. We present for the first time data on the
   spatiotemporal distribution and loud-calling behavior of the Milne
   Edwards' sportive lemur, known to forage solitarily during the night,
   but to form stable male-female sleeping groups during the day. Data
   include radio-tracking observations of sleeping associations, and focal
   follows of pair partners during dispersal in the evenings and reunions
   in the mornings. Male-female pairs forming stable sleeping associations
   during the day were pair-bonded. They used sleeping sites and home
   ranges exclusively, and exchanged loud calls at potentially restricted
   resources during dispersal in the evenings and during reunion in the
   mornings. Direct agonistic conflicts between pairs and others were rare.
   The acoustic analysis of loud calls revealed nine major call types. They
   carry signatures for sex and pair identity, and provide the substrate
   for signaling and the potential for recognizing pair ownership. Thus,
   pairs use loud call exchanges as a vocal display for signaling territory
   ownership, thus limiting direct aggressive encounters between neighbors
   and strangers. Altogether, our findings provide the first empirical
   evidence for the hypothesis that loud calling has evolved as a key
   mechanism for regulating space use and cohesiveness in dispersed
   pair-living primates.},

Abstract = {In the new Masoala exhibit of the Zurich Zoo four self-operated food

   three white-fronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus albifrons) and one Alaotran
   gentle lemur (Hapalemur griseus alaotrensis). Data obtained by direct
   observations with and without food boxes present were compared. In
   addition, visitors were surveyed to investigate attractiveness of the
   lemurs. Overall activity and locomotor behavior increased due to food
   box presentation. Furthermore, the visitor survey documented that the
   lemurs were spotted more often in trees when the food boxes were
   present. Because behavior patterns of the subjects approached natural
   levels with food boxes, the presentation of self-operated food boxes
   seems a valuable tool to improve the captive environment of lemurs. Zoo

Abstract = {I calculated rates of predation by 2 species of diurnal raptors,
   Polyboroides radiatus and Accipiter henstii, on the lemur community of
   Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar from 2700 h of observation and 470
   prey deliveries at 7 nests of each hawk species. The 2 hawks consumed 7
   of 12 lemurs found in the park region, with a body mass of 63-3500 g and
   including diurnal and nocturnal species of all group sizes. Calculations
   of predation rates indicate that raptor predation is a significant cause
   of mortality for lemur populations relative to other causes. Minimum
   rates of predation by Polyboroides radiatus and Accipiter henstii on
   Microcebus rufus, Cheirogaleus major, Avahi laniger, Hapalemur griseus,
   Eulemur fulvus rufus, Eulemur rubriventer, and Varecia variegata
   resulted in the raptors removing of 1-21\% of the population per yr,
   similar to other rates of predation on primates documented in the
   literature. Modeling of lemur populations under varying levels of raptor
   predation pressure that I calculated found that one may attribute 3-17\%
   of adult, juvenile, and infant mortality for nocturnal lemurs and 2-66\%
   of adult, juvenile, and infant mortality for diurnal lemurs to diurnal
   raptor predation. Raptor predation may significantly depress intrinsic
   growth rates and carrying capacity of Avahi laniger, Hapalemur griseus,
   Eulemur fulvus rufus, Eulemur rubriventer, and Varecia variegata owing
   to their low fecundities, long life spans, and long age to sexual
   maturation. Nocturnal lemurs may best avoid predation by diurnal raptors
   by exhibiting a solitary lifestyle and cryptic antipredator tactics,
   whereas, diurnal lemurs benefit less by increasing group size than by
   using specific antipredator tactics.},

Title = {Did lemurs have sweepstake tickets? An exploration of Simpson's model
   for the colonization of Madagascar by mammals},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {33},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Aim To investigate the validity of Simpson's model of sweepstakes
   dispersal, particularly as it applies to the colonization of Madagascar
   by African mammals. We chose lemurs as a classic case.
   Location The East African coast, the Mozambique Channel and Madagascar.
   Methods First, we investigated the assumptions underlying Simpson's
   statistical model as it relates to dispersal events. Second, we modelled
   the fate of a natural raft carrying one or several migrating mammals
   under a range of environmental conditions: in the absence of winds or
   currents, in the presence of winds and currents, and with and without a
   sail. Finally, we investigated the possibility of an animal being
   transported across the Mozambique Channel by an extreme climatic event
   like a tornado or a cyclone.
   Results Our investigations show that Simpson's assumptions are
   consistently violated when applied to scenarios of over-water dispersal
   by mammals. We suggest that a simple binomial probability model is an
   inappropriate basis for extrapolating the likelihood of dispersal
   events. One possible alternative is to use a geometric probability
   model. Our estimates of current and wind trajectories show that the most
   likely fate for a raft emerging from an estuary on the east coast of
   Africa is to follow the Mozambique current and become beached back on
   the African coast. Given prevailing winds and currents, transport from
   Madagascar to Africa is very much more likely than the reverse process.
   Freak transport by means of a hurricane or tornado is even less likely
   than rafting for mammals.

Abstract = {The removal, or absence, of predatory species could be a contributing
   proximate factor to the rise of primate cathemerality. But predators
   themselves can also be cathemeral, so cathemerality could well be an
   evolutionary stable strategy. From a comparative perspective, it appears
   that the effect of predatory species cannot provide a unitary
   explanation for cathemerality. Varying distributions and population
   densities of predators, especially raptors, may be key factors in owl
   monkey ( Aotus) cathemerality, but temperature and lunar cycle variation
   have also been implicated. In Madagascar, while raptors are potential
   predators of lemur species, the cathemerality of Eulemur species
   coincides with that of the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), a major predatory
   threat to lemurs. Thus, lemurid cathemerality may be more parsimoniously
   explained as an evolutionary stable strategy. Copyright (c) 2006 S.

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {77},
Number = {6},
Pages = {446-464},
Abstract = {Fossils relevant to lemuriform origins are reviewed. Omanodon seems very
   close to the other early tooth-combed lemuriforms Karanisia, Wadilemur
   and Saharagalago, whereas Bugtilemur is rejected from the Lemuriformes.
   The Djebelemurinae, including Djebelemur and `Anchomomys' milleri, are
   considered as stem lemuriforms preceding tooth comb differentiation;
   they are shown to be very distinct from European adapiforms. With
   tooth-combed lemuriforms present in Africa around 40 million years ago,
   and stem lemuriforms without tooth combs present on the same continent
   around 50 48 million years ago, a reasonable scenario can be proposed:
   tooth comb differentiation and lemuriform dispersal to Madagascar
   between 52-40 million years ago. The possible significance of
   Plesiopithecus for daubentoniid origins is raised. A critique of
   molecular dates is presented in the light of the fossil record. Azibiids
   are possibly early African prosimians. The timing of the dispersal of
   primates to Africa and the problem of strepsirhine origins are briefly
   examined. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {A detailed fission process in a wild ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta)
   troop was observed at Berenty Reserve, Madagascar. The troop fission
   occurred as follows: 1) During the birth season in 2000, two adult
   females (mother and daughter) were evicted as a result of ``targeted
   aggression{''} (i.e., intense and persistent aggressive behavior toward
   particular individuals). 2) Two adult and three immature females in the
   same kin group as the evicted females spontaneously immigrated into the
   new group. 3) A male immigrated into the new group 1.5 months later. 4)
   The new troop successfully established its own home range. This report
   exemplifies three characteristics of troop fission in ring-tailed
   lemurs. First, targeted aggression initiated the fission process.
   Second, the troop females divided along matrilineal lines. Finally, no
   male played a specific role in the fission process.},

Volume = {77},

Note = {1st Forum on Cathemerality, Turin, ITALY, 2004},
Abstract = {In past decades, cathemerality-as defined by Tattersall {[} 1987] - has
   been documented in two primate families: Cebidae and Lemuridae. In the
   Lemuridae, in particular the genus Eulemur, cathemeral activity seems to
   be a regular behavioural trait. Nevertheless, ultimate and proximate
   determinants responsible for this behaviour remain unclear. In this
   study, in a dry and deciduous forest on Mayotte ( Comoro Archipelago),
   activities of 4 female brown lemurs ( Eulemur fulvus fulvus) were
   recorded by focal animal sampling during the daylight period and by scan
   sampling on their respective groups during the night. Horizontal
   distances travelled by females and groups were measured using GPS.
   During the daylight period, food intakes were estimated in grams by
   extrapolation of counting of mouthfuls after weighing a large sample of
   plant parts eaten. Crude protein, crude lipid, soluble sugar and crude
   fibre were analyzed for each seasonal reconstituted diet. Records of
   temperature and rainfall were supplied by a local meteorological
   station. Observations confirmed cathemerality in the Mayotte brown lemur
   as reported by Tattersall in 1977. During the dry season, the animals
   increased their nocturnal activity - substantially increasing the time
   devoted to feeding and moving overall, but especially at night - and
   were less active during the daylight period. The quality of their diet
   in the dry season was poorer than that in the wet season, with soluble
   sugar content and protein content decreasing and fibre content
   increasing slightly. As a result, Mayotte brown lemurs may need to
   extend their foraging activity over the 24-hour cycle to balance
   nutritional requirements. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

Abstract = {Lemurs in captivity progressively accumulate iron deposits in a variety
   of organs (hemosiderosis) including duodenum, liver, and spleen
   throughout their lives. When excessive, the toxic effects of
   intracellular iron on parenchymal cells, particularly the liver, can
   result in clinical disease and death. The pathogenesis of excessive iron
   storage in these species has been attributed to dietary factors related
   to diets commonly fed in captivity. Tissue iron stores can be directly
   estimated by tissue biopsy and histologic examination, or quantitated by
   chemical analysis of biopsy tissue. However, expense and risk associated
   with anesthesia and surgery prevent routine use of tissue biopsy to
   assess iron status. A noninvasive means of assessing total body iron
   stores is needed to monitor iron stores in lemurs to determine whether
   dietary modification is preventing excessive iron deposition, and to
   monitor potential therapies such as phlebotomy or chelation. Serum
   ferritin concentration correlates with tissue iron stores in humans,
   horses, calves, dogs, cats, and pigs. Serum ferritin is considered the
   best serum analyte to predict total body iron stores in these species
   and is more reliable than serum iron or total iron binding capacity.
   both of which may be affected by disorders unrelated to iron adequacy or
   excess including hypoproteinemia. chronic infection, hemolytic anemia,
   hypothyroidism, renal disease, and drug administration. We have
   developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure serum ferritin
   in lemurs. The assay uses polyclonal rabbit anti-human ferritin
   antibodies in a sandwich arrangement. Ferritin isolated from liver and
   spleen of a black and white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata variegata)
   was used as a standard. Ferritin standards were linear from 0 to 50 mu
   g/L. Recovery of purified ferritin from lemur serum varied from 95\% to
   110\%. The within-assay variability was 4.5\%, and the assay-to-assay
   variability for three different samples ranged from 10\% to 17\%. The
   assay also measures serum ferritin in several other lemur species.},

   data were examined in light of two black and white ruffed lemurs that
   were treated for iron overload with serial phlebotomies. Prior to
   therapy, both phlebotomized lemurs had excess hepatic iron deposition,
   but had serum iron, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin below the
   upper limits observed in the survey animals, suggesting that some
   clinically normal animals included in the survey may have accumulated
   excess systemic iron. Serial phlebotomy therapy reduced serum iron,
   transferrin saturation. and serum ferritin in both animals. Three years
   after the conclusion of therapy in the one remaining case, serum iron
   and transferrin saturation have risen substantially, whereas serum
   ferritin has risen slightly. Serum iron, transferrin saturation, and
   serum ferritin may be useful predictors of systemic iron stores in this

Year = {2005},
Volume = {49},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We report here definitive evidence of butchery, most probably associated
   with hunting, of giant extinct lemurs by early human settlers in
   Madagascar. Specimens of Palaeopropithecus ingens and Pachylemur
   insignis from two sites in southwestern Madagascar, Taolambiby and
   Tsirave, show classic signs of butchering. We compared these to the
   bones (also from Taolambiby) of butchered Propithecus verreauxi, a lemur
   still living in the region. The characteristics of the tool-induced
   extinct-lemur bone alterations (sharp cuts and chop marks near joints,
   oblique cuts along the shafts, spiral fractures, and percussion striae)
   suggest skinning, disarticulation, and filleting. Conclusive evidence of
   megafaunal modification by humans in Madagascar was limited previously
   to a few hippo and elephant bird bones and one extinct aye-aye tooth.
   New evidence comes not from archaeological sites, but from specimens
   collected in the early 1900s, without stratigraphic records, at
   ``subfossil{''} sites (i.e., sites renowned for their late Pleistocene
   or Holocene fossils, often lacking human artifacts). Whereas these are
   hardly the most ideal samples for analysis of this kind, careful
   scrutiny of the characteristics of the cut marks has allowed us to
   document butchery beyond any reasonable doubt. One bone with definitive
   cut marks has been dated to the very earliest part of the human period
   in Madagascar. Continued, careful research on the bones in subfossil
   collections is warranted. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {There are at least three distinct taxa of woolly lemurs (genus Avahi) in

   east of the Betsiboka River to the Bay of Narinda. Avahi unicolor occurs
   well to the north, including the Ampasindava peninsula and the
   Manongarivo Special Reserve. Here we describe a third Auahi population
   in central western Madagascar, which was discovered in the Bemaraha
   Strict Nature Reserve in the Tsingy de Bemaraha region, north of the
   Manambolo River. The description is based on a released type individual
   from which we obtained hair samples, photographs, and tape and 2 video
   recordings. Its entire range is believed to be less than 5,000 km and
   forest loss, along with an observed continuing decline in numbers,
   indicates that this species should be considered Endangered or even
   Critically Endangered, according to the Red List criteria of the World

Abstract = {Ground reaction forces were recorded for jumps of three individuals each
   of Lemur catta and Eulemur fulvus. Animals jumped back and forth between
   a ground-mounted force plate and a 0.5-m elevated platform, covering
   horizontal distances of 0.5-2 m. In total, 190 takeoffs and 263 landings
   were collected. Animals typically jumped from a run up and into a run
   out, during which they gained or into which they carried horizontal
   impulse. Correspondingly, vertical impulses dominated takeoffs and
   landings. Peak forces were moderate in magnitude and not much higher
   than forces reported for quadrupedal gaits. This is in contrast to the
   forces for standing jumps of specialized leapers that considerably
   exceed forces associated with quadrupedal gaits. Force magnitudes for
   the lemur jumps are more comparable to peak forces reported for other
   quadrupeds performing running jumps. Takeoffs are characterized by
   higher hindlimb than forelimb peak forces and impulses. L. catta
   typically landed with the hindlimbs making first contact, and the
   hindlimb forces and impulses were higher than the forelimb forces and
   impulses at landing. E. fuluus typically landed with the forelimbs
   striking first and also bearing the higher forces. This pattern does not
   fully conform to the paradigm of primate limb force distribution, with
   higher hindlimb than forelimb forces. However, the absolute highest
   forces in E. fuluus also occur at the hindlimbs, during acceleration for
   takeoff.},

Abstract = {A study was conducted between 1989 and 2001 to monitor changes in the
   dominance ranks among adult ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) at Berenty
   Reserve, Madagascar. Adult females were observed to be dominant over
   adult males. Their rank fluctuated greatly. However, in some troops,
   female rank orders were fairly stable over a period of several years. In
   general, male ranks were more unstable than female ranks. Most young
   females aged 3 years occupied the lowest ranks among adult females.
   However, several were also observed to have attained relatively higher
   ranks, placing them right beneath their high-ranking mothers; this
   suggested the existence of ``dependent ranks{''}. Mothers were dominant
   over their daughters. Similarly, older sisters were usually dominant
   over younger sisters. The mean duration of alpha status for females was
   1.95 years, although considerable variation was observed in the duration
   of the alpha status (1-5 or more years). Most young males aged 3 years
   initially occupied the lowest ranks in their natal troops, and then they
   migrated to non-natal troops around the age of 4 years. They ascended in
   rank between the ages of 4 and 6 years, although there was considerable
   variation in the acquirement of high rank. The mean duration of alpha
   status for males was 2.2 years. Larger males were observed to occupy
   higher ranks. Occasionally, both males and females showed intense
   aggression (i.e., targeting aggression) towards others.},

Abstract = {A wealth of data demonstrating that monkeys and apes represent number
   have been interpreted as suggesting that sensitivity to number emerged
   early in primate evolution, if not before. Here we examine the numerical
   capacities of the mongoose lemur (Eulemur mongoz), a member of the
   prosimian suborder of primates that split from the common ancestor of
   monkeys, apes and humans approximately 47-54 million years ago. Subjects
   observed as an experimenter sequentially placed grapes into an opaque
   bucket. On half of the trials the experimenter placed a subset of the
   grapes into a false bottom such that they were inaccessible to the
   lemur. The critical question was whether lemurs would spend more time
   searching the bucket when food should have remained in the bucket,
   compared to when they had retrieved all of the food. We found that the
   amount of time lemurs spent searching was indicative of whether grapes
   should have remained in the bucket, and furthermore that lemur search
   time reliably differentiated numerosities that differed by a 1:2 ratio,
   but not those that differed by a 2:3 or 3:4 ratio. Finally, two control
   conditions determined that lemurs represented the number of food items,
   and neither the odor of the grapes, nor the amount of grape (e.g., area)
   in the bucket. These results suggest that mongoose lemurs have numerical
   representations that are modulated by Weber's Law.},

Abstract = {Although much is known about how some primates-in particular, monkeys
   and apes-represent and enumerate different numbers of objects, very
   little is known about the numerical abilities of prosimian primates.
   Here, we explore how four lemur species (Eulemur fulvus, E. mongoz,
   Lemur catta, and Varecia rubra) represent small numbers of objects.
   Specifically, we presented lemurs with three expectancy violation
   looking time experiments aimed at exploring their expectations about a
   simple 1+1 addition event. In these experiments, we presented subjects
   with displays in which two lemons were sequentially added behind an
   occluder and then measured subjects' duration of looking to expected and
   unexpected outcomes. In experiment 1, subjects looked reliably longer at
   an unexpected outcome of only one object than at an expected outcome of
   two objects. Similarly, subjects in experiment 2 looked reliably longer
   at an unexpected outcome of three objects than at an expected outcome of
   two objects. In experiment 3, subjects looked reliably longer at an
   unexpected outcome of one object twice the size of the original than at
   an expected outcome of two objects of the original size. These results
   suggest that some prosimian primates understand the outcome of simple
   arithmetic operations. These results are discussed in light of similar
   findings in human infants and other adult primates.},

Abstract = {Glucocorticoids, a group of adrenal hormones, are secreted in response
   to stress. In male primates, variables such as breeding seasonality,
   dominance hierarchy stability, and aggressive and affiliative
   interactions can affect glucocorticoid levels. In this study, we
   examined interindividual differences in mean fecal glucocorticoid (fGC)
   levels among males in three groups of wild ring-tailed lemurs to better
   understand the physiological costs of group living for males in a
   female-dominant species that exhibits strict reproductive seasonality.
   Fecal and behavioral data samples were collected during one mating and
   two postmating seasons (2001 and 2003). The mean fGC levels were
   examined in relation to reproductive season, male rank, number of
   resident males, intermale and female-male agonism, and affiliative
   behavior with females. The mean fGC levels were not significantly
   elevated during mating season compared to the postmating period. During
   the mating season, male dominance hierarchies broke down and rank
   effects could not be tested; however, there was no relationship between
   male rank and fGC levels in the postmating periods. In 2001, males that
   resided in the group with the fewest males exhibited lower fGC levels
   during the postmating period. They also affiliated more with females
   than did males in the other groups. During the mating season of 2003,
   males engaged in more affiliative behaviors with females compared to the
   postmating season, but female-male agonism did not differ by season.
   However, rates of intermale agonism were significantly higher during
   mating compared to postmating periods, but such heightened agonism did
   not translate to a higher stress response. Thus, neither male-male
   competition for mates nor heightened agonism. between males during the
   breeding season affected male fGC levels. Fewer males residing in a
   group, however, did have some effect on male-female affiliation and male
   fGC levels outside of the mating period. Males that live in a group with
   only a few (two or three) males may experience less physiological stress
   than those that live in groups with more males.},

   display (urinate tail-up, UT-up); (ii) tail slightly raised to avoid its
   impregnation with urine (urinate tail-down, UT-down). We used both
   signaller- and receiver-based approaches to search for functional
   differences between these two kinds of urine deposition. We predicted
   that UT-up might be a complex signal combining olfactory and visual
   cues. We carried out observations and scent tests on four captive groups
   of ring-tailed lemurs. Group members sniffed/licked UT-up scents more
   frequently than UT-down ones. Moreover, UT-up showed peak levels during
   the mating season whereas UT-down did not. These findings suggest that
   urine can play a role in intra-group reproductive communication. Lemurs
   more frequently performed UT-up in a few drops and UT-down in streams.
   Recognition experiments clearly showed that individuals can discriminate
   between urine of their own group and urine from a foreign group (a
   necessary prerequisite for the use of urine in inter-group
   communication). The possible function of UT-up in inter-troop
   communication was supported by the higher frequency of this pattern
   along a fence separating two of the study groups. Moreover, in the
   presence of a dummy, the frequency of UT-up increased significantly. In
   conclusion, UT-up is a complex signal with multiple characteristics. By
   using different sensory channels, UT-up provides different types of
   information (location and signaller quality) and contains multiple
   messages directed both at group-members and neighbouring groups.},

Title = {Mediolateral forces associated with quadrupedal gaits of lemurids},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {266},
Number = {3},
Pages = {261-273},

Abstract = {Substrate reaction forces (SRFs) were quantified for 502 forelimb and
   hindlimb contacts in two primate species, Eulemur fulvus and Lemur
   catta. Three individuals of each taxon were encouraged to traverse a
   force transducer. Reaction forces were evaluated for linear locomotion
   on runway and simulated arboreal substrates. Preferred gaits differed
   between substrates: galloping on the runway and walking on simulated
   arboreal substrates. Unlike vertical and fore-aft (FA) forces,
   mediolateral (ML) forces during linear locomotion were relatively
   independent of speed, which suggests balancing the centre of body mass
   in the coronal plane was not speed related. Since peak ML forces
   occasionally exceeded peak FA forces, ML forces were not of trivial
   importance during primate quadrupedal locomotion. Both lemurids
   regularly experienced lower ML peak forces during `arboreal' than
   `terrestrial' quadrupedalism, probably to minimize side-to-side
   fluctuations of their centre of mass over the simulated arboreal branch
   supports. Eulemur fulvus encountered greater ML peak forces in their
   forelimbs, while L. catta encountered greater hindlimb peak ML forces.
   Lemurids most frequently exerted medially directed peak side-to-side
   forces during arboreal quadrupedalism and laterally directed peak
   side-to-side forces during terrestrial quadrupedalism. The direction of
   hindlimb ML peak force, however, was less consistent than forelimb ML
   peak force regardless of substrate. The lemurs experienced oscillations
   in the direction of the forelimb and hindlimb ML force over the duration
   of support phase, suggesting that both pairs of limbs contributed to
   balance. More frequent changes in ML force direction of the hindlimb
   support the predominance of these limbs in keeping side-to-side balance.
   The results of our study suggest that ML forces warrant consideration in
   locomotion studies, especially when evaluating joint moments and bending
   regimes of long bones.},

Title = {Female age-specific reproductive rates, birth seasonality, and infant

Abstract = {To compare reproductive parameters of a managed population of
   free-ranging provisioned ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) to wild L.
   catta populations, we analyzed birth and mortality records collected
   over the 17-year history of the St. Catherines Island ring-tailed lemur
   colony. The majority of births in this colony (approximately 80\%)
   occurred in March, which indicates that most females at this site
   conceived during the first estrus cycle of the breeding season, as do
   wild ring-tailed lemur females (Sauther {[}1991] Am J Phys Anthropol
   84:463-77). Females in this provisioned colony reach the age at first
   parturition (primiparous age) earlier (at 2 years) than do wild
   ring-tailed lemurs, which typically begin to reproduce at 3 years of age
   (Sussman {[}1991] Am J Primatol 84:43-58; Koyama et al. {[}2001]
   Primates 42:1-14; Gould et al. {[}2003] Am J Phys Anthropol 120:182-94).
   Female fecundity is lowest at 2 years of age (34\%), but increases to
   67-100\% for females age 3 and older. Survival analyses showed that
   infant survivorship for very young (2-3 years) and very old females (>
   10 years) are similar, and are lower than that for reproductively
   prime-aged females (4-9 years), although this trend is not statistically
   significant (chi(2) = 3.18, df = 2, n = 125, P = 0.203). There was a
   large amount of variability in infant survival rates among the oldest
   females, and a few older females (ages 13 and 14) still had high infant
   survival rates despite their old age. When compared to wild populations,
   provisioning in this island colony generally caused a decrease in the
   female primiparous age, a decrease in infant mortality, and an increase
   in multiple-offspring births (twins or triplets).},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Black lemurs, Eulemur macaco, are classified as generalist feeders,
   consuming a proportion of fruits and leaves that varies with seasonal
   availability. It is hypothesized that black lemurs are capable of using
   neutral detergent fiber (NDF) as a source of energy through fiber
   fermentation in the cecum and large intestine. In captivity, they are
   typically fed a diet of commercially available primate biscuits and
   readily available produce, both of which are limited in NDE
   Digestibility trials were conducted on 14 black lemurs; 12 were housed
   in groups (four, three, three, and two) and 2 were individually housed.
   The lemurs were fed four manufactured feeds differing in fiber form and
   content. A commercially available primate biscuit, containing
   approximately 27\% NDF, served as the control diet. The second diet
   contained the same primate biscuits, which were ground and then
   incorporated into a fiber-based gel matrix. The third and fourth diets
   were formulated using soybean hulls or ground corncobs as the fiber
   source, resulting in 53\% and 47\% NDF, respectively. Produce was added
   to the diet at 36\% (dry matter basis). Dry matter digestibility
   differed significantly among all diets: Neutral detergent fiber
   digestibility was highest. for the ground biscuit in gel and lowest for
   the two high-fiber gel diets, with biscuit digestibility values falling
   between the two extremes. The high-fiber gel diets were successful in
   increasing the NDF concentrations of the primate diets; however, black
   lemurs were capable of only limited fiber digestion.},

Abstract = {Complete medical examinations were performed on 11 wild ruffed lemurs

   wild lemurs were found for the following serum biochemical and blood
   count parameters: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total protein (TP),
   albumin, blood urea nitrogen, cholesterol, glucose, amylase, band
   neutrophil count, and eosinophil count. Low blood urea nitrogen (BUN)

Abstract = {Adaptive explanations for social grouping assume that there are fitness
   consequences associated with group size, and individuals maintain
   membership in groups of favorable size to maximize fitness. Here I
   examine fecal cortisol concentrations as a hormonal measure of stress to
   assess the relative well-being of Lemur catta in groups of different
   size and in seasons of normal and low tamarind fruit availability. I
   test the hypotheses that there is an optimal group size at which
   cortisol is lowest and that optimal group size changes in food-scarce
   conditions. I collected 799 fecal samples from 87 individuals in seven
   free-ranging L. catta groups at Berenty Reserve, Madagascar, over a
   1-year period (August 1999-July 2000) and determined fecal cortisol
   concentrations using a radioimmunoassay. Expressing these as residuals
   from monthly population means to control for temporal fluctuations in
   cortisol concentration, I calculated mean fecal cortisol levels for each
   animal in seasons of normal and low tamarind fruit abundance and over
   the entire year. Overall, females exhibited lowest mean cortisol levels
   in groups of intermediate size, suggesting that there are benefits to
   maintaining membership in these groups. Females in groups that were
   atypically large or small for their habitat type had higher mean
   cortisol levels than typical groups. Cortisol levels increased in
   food-scarce conditions for larger groups, suggesting that intergroup
   competitive advantages do not outweigh intragroup feeding competition at
   this time. Group size may be optimized for long-term average conditions,
   and short-term stresses may intermittently alter the costs associated
   with group size.},

   represent only a subset of the taxonomic and ecological diversity

   of geographic ranges and quantification of habitat area and population
   size for diurnal and cathemeral (active during both day and night)
   lemurs. Recent satellite images are used to develop a forest cover
   geographical information system, and censuses are used to establish
   range boundaries and develop estimates of population density and size.
   These assessments are used to identify regions and taxa at risk, and
   will be a useful baseline for future monitoring of habitat and
   populations. Precise estimates are impossible for patchily-distributed
   taxa (especially Hapalemur aureus, H. simus and Varecia variegata

   group size. I examined correlations between pressures commonly proposed
   as causes of social grouping (foraging success, intergroup and
   intragroup agonism, and predation risk) and individual levels of fecal
   cortisol, a hormonal stress measure, in a free-ranging population of
   Lemur catta. I collected behavioral data on 45 female Lemur catta at
   Berenty Reserve, Madagascar, over 3 seasons (August 1999-July 2000) and
   determined individual cortisol levels from 474 fecal samples. Neither
   predator alarm rates nor intragroup agonism rates correlated with
   cortisol levels in any season. However, females with low daily food
   intake and high rates of escalated intergroup defense exhibited higher
   cortisol levels. The data suggest that acquisition and defense of food
   resources are principal challenges in Lemur catta, and may be important
   factors determining social grouping and other behavioral or life history
   adaptations.},

   the study. Animals, with high glucocorticoid levels had a significantly
   higher mortality rate. This result suggests that glucocorticoid.
   measures can be useful predictors of individual survival probabilities

Title = {Gait mechanics of lemurid primates on terrestrial and arboreal
   substrates},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {199-217},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Aspects of gait mechanics of two lemurid species were explored
   experimentally. Substrate reaction forces were recorded for three
   animals each of L. catta and E. fulvus walking and running at voluntary
   speeds either on a wooden runway with an integrated force platform or on
   elevated pole supports with a section attached to the force platform.
   The average height of the back over these substrates and fluctuations in
   this height were evaluated using video-analysis.
   Animals preferred walking gaits and lower speeds on the poles, and
   gallops and higher speeds on the ground. At overlapping speeds, few
   adjustments to substrate types were identified. Hind limb peak forces
   are usually lower on the poles than on the ground, and the caudal back
   is closer to the substrate. This suggests that greater hind limb flexion
   and reduced limb stiffness occurred on the poles. The support phases for
   both limbs at higher speeds are slightly elongated on the poles.
   Forelimb peak forces are not lower, and the trajectory of the caudal
   back does not follow a smoother path, i.e., not all elements of a
   compliant gait are present on the simulated arboreal substrates. The
   horizontal, rigid poles, offered as substitutes for branchlike supports
   in the natural habitat, may not pose enough of a challenge to require
   more substantial gait adjustments.
   Across substrates, forelimb peak forces are generally lower than hind
   limb peak forces. The interlimb force distribution is similar to that of
   most other primates with more even limb lengths. Walking gaits present a
   greater divergence in fore- and hind limb forces than galloping gaits,
   which are associated with higher forces. The more arboreal E.fulvus has
   higher forelimb forces than the more terrestrial L. catta, unlike some
   anthropoid species in which the arborealists have lower forelimb forces
   than the terrestrialists. As in other primate and nonprimate quadrupeds,
   the major propulsive thrust comes from the hind limbs in both lemurs.
   While our data confirm certain aspects of primate gait mechanics (e.g.,
   generally higher hind limb forces), they do not fully support the notion
   of greater limb compliance. Neither a compliant forelimb on branchlike
   supports, nor a negative correlation of forelimb force magnitudes with
   degree of arboreality were observed. Increasing
   forelimb-to-hind-limb-force-ratios with increasing speed and force
   magnitudes are also not expected under this paradigm. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   Clinically normal free-ranging or previously free-ranging lemurs,

   lemurs (Eulemur macaco flavifrons), and four black and white ruffed

   antigen gene and 3-repeat variants of the 120-kDa antigen gene.
   Sequencing of the VLPT genes revealed a novel amino acid repeat unit

Abstract = {Differences in dietary profiles and gastrointestinal (GI) morphologies
   observed across lemur species suggest that there may be variation in
   patterns of digesta flow through the GI tract related to the method of
   digesta processing. Using radio-opaque barium-impregnated polyethylene
   spheres (BIPS), we characterized such patterns in four lemur species:
   Varecia variegata (VV), Eulemur fulvus (EF), Propithecus verreauxi (PV),
   and Hapalemur griseus (HG) (n=2 per species). After an initial
   radiograph was taken under light sedation, the animals were fed the BIPS
   together with a small meal. A combination of 30 small (1.5 mm) and 10
   large (5 mm) BIPS was administered. Radiographs were then taken on a
   species-dependent basis up to 48 hr post-dosage. For small BIPS, the
   gastric transit time (GTT; time of first exit of BIPS from stomach) was
   0.25-2 hr for VV, EF, and HG, and approximately 10 hr for PV. The
   oro-rectal transit time (ORTT; time of first appearance in the rectum)
   was <2 hr for VV and EF, and 24.0 hr for PV and HG. The intestinal
   transit time (ITT, measured as ORTT - GTT) was <1.5 hr for VV and EF,
   and approximately 14 hr and 22 hr for PV and HG, respectively. These
   data suggest that the GTT of digesta as measured with BIPS was rapid for
   VV, EF, and HG. For VV and EF, the ORTT and ITT were also rapid, while
   for HG they were much slower. PV was characterized by delayed GTT, and a
   more rapid ITT compared to HG. Thus, patterns of flow for PV and HG,
   despite similar ORTT, differed in that HG emptied BIPS more rapidly and
   ITT was slower. The flow of BIPS did not differ for VV and EF. These
   data reveal new information in addition to the total tract transit time,
   and complement existing knowledge regarding anatomy and diet. (C) 2004

Abstract = {In vivo digestibility and transit of two experimental diets were
   compared across four lemur species for which gastrointestinal morphology
   and preliminary data on physiology differ: Varecia variegate (VV),
   Eulemur fulvus (EF), Propithecus verreauxi (PV), and Hapalemur griseus
   (HG). Since free-ranging groups consume varied amounts of slowly
   fermentable insoluble fiber (IF) and rapidly fermentable soluble fiber
   (SF), differences in digestibility may be related to variation in the
   fiber types consumed. To investigate this, two diets were designed to
   provide 28\% of dry matter (DM) as total dietary fiber (TDF). The ratio
   of IF/SF (g/g) differed across the diets (12.15:1 for the IF diet, and
   3.76:1 for the IF/SF diet). The DM digestibility (DMD) of both diets
   differed across species: DMD was lower for EF and VV (approximately
   56-58\%), and higher for PV (72\%) and HG (76\%). The fiber
   digestibility results were as follows: TDF digestibility was similar for
   VV and EF (23\% and 28\%), higher for PV (56\%), and highest for HG
   (66\%). IF digestibility was lower for VV and EF (20\% and 28\%), and
   higher for PV and HG (53\% and 62\%). The transit times (TTs) of the two
   markers Cr and Co were similar (approximately 3.5 hr for VV and EF, 25
   hr for PV, and 30 hr for HG). The mean retention times (MRTs) showed the
   same trend. The results from these captive groups suggest there are
   large differences in digestive efficiency that are likely related to the
   varied fiber composition of the free-ranging diet, and the amount of
   time the digesta are retained in the gut. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Our goal is to go deep into behavioral olfactory strategies possibly
   used by ring-tailed lemurs in reproductive competition and to shed some
   light on the function of female scent marks deposited outside the
   breeding season. We followed 16 captive adults at the Pistoia Zoo (
   Tuscany, Italy) for > 1,500 h from May 1997 to March 1999. Male direct
   and indirect olfactory investigation on females showed complementary
   distributions, the former peaking during the breeding and the latter
   during the birth season. Males are thus able to monitor female
   reproductive conditions throughout the whole year. During the birth
   season there was an increase of female genital marking. The olfactory
   advertisement probably guarantees that the extremely brief estrus does
   not remain unnoticed and allows male intrasexual competition a long
   period to operate. Male indirect olfactory monitoring and countermarking
   on female signals peaked during the birth season, which suggests that
   male intrasexual competition is achieved both by getting female chemical
   messages and by concealing them from other males. Female countermarking
   on other female genital marks peaked during the breeding season.
   High-ranking females had higher frequencies of countermarking than those
   of low-ranking females, which suggests that the advantage of
   obliterating scent signals of other females is greater than the
   disadvantage of revealing one's own reproductive condition.},

Abstract = {A new technique for molar use-wear analysis is applied to samples of all
   16 species of extinct lemurs with known dentitions, as well as to a
   large comparative sample of extant primates. This technique, which
   relies on the light refractive properties of wear pits and scratches as
   seen under a standard stereoscopic microscope, has shown itself to be
   effective in distinguishing the diets of ungulates and extant primates.
   We draw dietary inferences for each of the 16 extinct lemur species in
   our database. There is a strong phylogenetic signal, with the
   Palaeopropithecidae showing use-wear signatures similar to those of the
   Indriidae; extinct lemurids (Paehylemur spp.) showing striking
   similarities to extant lemurids (except Hapalemur spp.); and Megaladapis
   showing similarities to Lepilemur spp. Only the Archaeolemuridae have
   dietary signatures unlike those of any extant lemurs, with the partial
   exception of Dauhentonia. We conclude that the Archaeolemuridae were
   hard-object feeders; the Palaeopropithecidae were seed predators,
   consuming a mixed diet of foliage and fruit to varying degrees;
   Pachylemur was a fruit-dominated mixed feeder, but not a seed predator;
   and all Megaladapis were leaf browsers. There is no molar use wear
   evidence that any of the extinct lemurs relied on terrestrial foods (C4
   grasses, tubers, rhizomes). This has possible implications for the role
   of the disappearance of wooded habitats in the extinction of lemurs.

Abstract = {Latrine behavior, or the preferential, repeated use of 1 or more
   specific defecation sites, is well known among mammals and believed to
   function in olfactory communication among individuals or groups in many
   circumstances. Primates have reduced their capacity for olfaction in
   favor of more developed visual systems; however, several prosimian
   primates regularly use olfactory communication for transmission of
   social signals, most often using scent gland secretions and urine.
   Latrine behaviors have been described rarely in primates and have
   traditionally not been included in reviews of primate olfactory
   communication, yet we found ample evidence that certain primate species
   habitually use latrine sites for defecation. Here we review the previous
   evidence for latrine use in primates and report new and more extensive
   observations of latrine use in 2 lemuriform primates (Lepilemur sp. and
   Hapalemur griseus). Based on these new observations, we present and
   evaluate 4 available hypotheses for the function of latrines
   (advertisement of sexual cycling, predation avoidance, intragroup
   spacing, and intergroup resource defense) in lemur taxa for which
   sufficient evidence of latrine use exists. In all cases, intergroup
   resource defense is the function most consistent with available
   observations.},

Abstract = {Redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus) and Verreaux's sifakas
   (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) occur sympatrically in western
   Madagascar. Both species exhibit a so-called mixed alarm call system
   with functionally referential alarm calls for raptors and general alarm
   calls for carnivores and raptors. General alarm calls also occur in
   other contexts associated with high arousal, such as inter-group
   encounters. Field playback experiments were conducted to investigate
   whether interspecific recognition of alarm calls occurs in both species,
   even though the two species rarely interact. In a crossed design,
   red-fronted lemur and sifaka alarm calls were broadcast to individuals
   of both species, using the alarm call of chacma baboons (Papio
   cynocephalus) as a control. Both species responded with appropriate
   escape strategies and alarm calls after playbacks of heterospecific
   aerial alarm calls. Similarly, they reacted appropriately to playbacks
   of heterospecific general alarm calls. Playbacks of baboon alarm calls
   elicited no specific responses in either lemur species, indicating that
   an understanding of interspecific alarm calls caused the responses and
   not alarm calls in general. Thus, the two lemur species have an
   understanding of each other's aerial as well as general alarm calls,
   suggesting that even in species that do not form mutualistic
   associations and rarely interact, common predator pressure has been
   sufficient for the development of heterospecific call recognition.},

Abstract = {Our study provides the first data on the social organization of the
   golden brown mouse lemur, a nocturnal primate discovered in northwestern
   Madagascar in 1994. The study was carried out in two 6-month field
   periods during the dry season, covering time before and during the
   mating season. The spatial and temporal distributions of the sexes in
   the population were investigated by mark/recapture and radiotelemetry.
   Focal observations and the determination of sleeping associations
   provided further insights into the sociality of this solitary forager.
   High intra- and intersexual home-range overlaps occurred throughout the
   study. In general, individuals of both sexes had spatial access to more
   than one conspecific of the same and the opposite sex. We found no
   indication for spatial monopolization of females by certain males. These
   results suggest a dispersed multimale/multifemale system with a
   promiscuous mating pattern. Individuals showed temporal stability in
   their home range locations and interacted regularly with conspecifics.
   Five sleeping groups were identified during the study period: one female
   group and four mixed-sex groups. Even though sleeping sites were changed
   frequently, sleeping-group compositions remained stable over time.
   Thermoregulatory constraints are the most likely explanation for
   sleeping-group composition with members of both sexes in this species.
   Mixed-sex sleeping groups can be described as the basic social unit
   within this dispersed multimale/multifemale society. (C) 2004

Abstract = {In order to determine whether ring-tailed lemurs ( Lemur catta) adapt
   their ranging and select an optimal diet at a time of food shortage, we
   observed two adjacent troops in Berenty Reserve, Madagascar for over 250
   h. The troops, created by a recent fission, ranged through closed canopy
   gallery forest next to a river and open forest away from the river. We
   conducted the study in September - October, 2000, normally a time of
   seasonally low resource availability, which was intensified by damage
   from a previous windstorm and recent drought. To examine the impact of
   environmental stress, we mapped their ranging patterns, intertroop
   encounters, feeding patches, siesta trees, and sleeping trees. We then
   correlated their ranging and feeding behavior with nutritional analyses
   of leaves and fruit from tamarind trees located in different parts of
   their ranges. One of the troops, D1A, ranged farther into open forest
   than previously. However, the range for troop D1B and the closed canopy
   portion of D1A's range were located in traditional positions for
   historical troops D and E. Both troops ate significantly more mature
   leaves from the tamarind trees in the closed canopy forest, where the
   leaves had significantly higher nutritional content ( water and protein)
   than that of open forest samples. They fed on tamarind fruit
   significantly more often in the open forest away from the river, where
   it was more abundant. The lemurs selected a diet that maximized leaf
   water and protein and ranged where fruit was most abundant but at high
   energetic costs for troop D1A.},

Abstract = {To investigate for the first time the relationship between contrasting
   patterns of seasonal changes of the environment and activity, body mass
   and reproduction for small nocturnal primates in nature, we compared a
   population of golden brown mouse lemur (Microcebus ravelobensis) in a
   dry deciduous forest of northwestern Madagascar and of the brown mouse
   lemur (Microcebus rufus) in an evergreen rain forest of eastern
   Madagascar. Both species live under similar photoperiodic conditions.
   Golden brown mouse lemurs (GBML) were active during the whole period
   (May to December) irrespective of changing environmental conditions. In
   contrast, a part of the population of brown mouse lemurs (BML) showed
   prolonged seasonal torpor, related to body mass during periods of short
   day length and low ambient temperatures. Differences between species
   might be due to differences in ambient temperature and food supply. Body
   weight and tail thickness (adipose tissue reserve) did not show
   prominent differences between short and long photoperiods in GBML,
   whereas both differ significantly in BML, suggesting species-specific
   differences in the photoperiodically driven control of metabolism. Both
   species showed a seasonal reproduction. The rate of growth and size of
   the testes were similar and preceded estrous onset in both species
   suggesting a photoperiodic control of reproduction in males. The estrous
   onset in females occurred earlier in GBML than in BML. Estrous females
   were observed over at least 4 months in the former, but in only I month
   in the latter species. Intraspecific variation of estrous onset in GBML
   may be explained by body mass. Interspecific variation of female
   reproduction indicates species-specific differences in the control of
   reproduction. Thus, environmentally related differences in annual
   rhythms between closely related small nocturnal lemurs emerged that
   allow them to cope with contrasting patterns of seasonal changes in
   their habitats.},

Abstract = {Among nocturnal Malagasy prosimians, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus
   murinus) is considered a solitary species which has a promiscuous mating
   system. Indirect indicators, such as the lack of sexual dimorphism, the
   overlapping of male and female home ranges with each other, the
   synchronism of seasonal oestrus and the high relative testes size of
   males, support the presence of sperm competition. In captivity, an
   intense sexual precopulatory competition develops among males, leading
   to the emergence of a dominant male who fathers the majority of the
   litters. Although multiple mating did occur, the dominant male achieved
   the majority of the matings on the first day of oestrus. A
   `mate-guarding' behaviour, exhibited by the dominant male, was observed
   in 11 groups out of 15, on only the first day of the vaginal opening and
   was significantly more often directed towards younger females. Females
   also played an important role in sexual competition among males, since
   their presence enhances the aggressive interactions between males.
   Difference in aggressive behaviours of females, in response to male
   sexual solicitations, suggests female mate choice. Compared with data
   from wild animals, it may be hypothesised that alternative mating
   strategies can be used by male grey mouse lemurs to enhance their
   reproductive success, depending on the availability and distribution of
   receptive females. Copyright (C) 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

Year = {2003},
Volume = {74},
Number = {5-6},

Abstract = {Parental care should evolve only if fitness benefits exceed fitness
   costs. In Cheirogaleus medius, a small nocturnal lemur of western
   Madagascar, we found the peculiar situation of considerable parental
   care by both sexes, combined with an extremely high rate of extra-pair
   young (EPY). In this paper, we try to elucidate the costs and benefits
   of parental care in C medius, and we discuss hypotheses as to why males
   might actively participate in raising young, especially with regard to
   the high rate of EPY. The study was carried out in the dry deciduous
   forest of western Madagascar between 1996 and 2001. The most important
   components of parental care in C medius are babysitting and guarding of
   the young. Observational data suggest that thermoregulatory demands
   during the first days after birth and defence from predators may be the
   driving factors selecting for this infant care behaviour. The
   reproducing individuals of both sexes incur considerable energetic costs
   by this behaviour, resulting in reduced fat stores and body condition in
   comparison to non-reproducing individuals. The reason why males also
   care for EPY remains elusive. We propose that males might not be able to
   detect individual relatedness and that they would jeopardise the
   survival of their own young if they gave no parental care.
   Alternatively, they might gain advantages other than direct fitness from
   raising EPY, for example if caring behaviour increases their chances in
   further reproduction, or if EPY are fathered by close kin. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {The grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is a small nocturnal primate
   exhibiting daily torpor. In constant ambient temperature
   (22-24degreesC), body temperature (Tb) and locomotor activity were
   monitored by telemetry in animals exposed to short (SP: 10 h light/day)
   or long (LP: 14 light/day) photoperiods. They were first fed ad libitum
   for 8 days and then subjected to 80\% restricted feeding for 8 more
   days. During ad libitum feeding, locomotor activity was significantly
   lower in SP-exposed animals than in LP-exposed animals. Whatever the
   photoperiod, animals entered daily hypothermia within the first hours
   following the light onset. Depth of daily hypothermia increased
   irregularly under SP exposure, whereas minimal daily Tb was constantly
   above 35degreesC under LP exposure. After the transfer from long
   photoperiod to short photoperiod corresponding to the induction of
   seasonal fattening, locomotor activity and depth of controlled daily
   hypothermia did not change significantly. In contrast, food restriction
   led to a significant increase in locomotor activity and in frequency of
   daily torpor (Tb < 33degreesC) and body temperature reached minimum
   values averaging 25degreesC. However, SP-exposed animals exhibited lower
   minimal daily Tb and higher torpor duration than LP exposed animals.
   Therefore, daily torpor appears as a rapid response to food restriction
   occurring whatever the photoperiod, although enhanced by short
   photoperiod. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Trichromatic color vision is routine among catarrhine primates, but
   occurs only as a variant form of color vision. in some individuals in
   most platyrrhine genera. This arises from a fundamental difference in
   the organization of X-chromosome cone opsin genes in these two lineages:
   catarrhines have two opsin genes specifying middle- and
   long-wavelength-sensitive cone pigments, while platyrrhines have only a
   single gene. Some female platyrrhine monkeys achieve trichromacy because
   of a species polymorphism that allows the possibility of different opsin
   gene alleles on the two X-chromosomes. Recently, a similar opsin gene
   polymorphism was detected in some diurnal strepsirrhines, while at the
   same time appearing to be absent in any nocturnal genera. The aim of
   this study was to assess whether cone pigment polymorphism is inevitably
   linked to diurnality in strepsirrhines. Cone photopigments were measured
   in a species usually classified as diurnal, the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur
   catta), using electroretinogram flicker photometry, a noninvasive
   electrophysiological procedure. Each of 12 animals studied was found to
   have the same middle-wavelength cone pigment, with peak sensitivity at
   about 547 nm. In conjunction with earlier results, this implies that
   cone pigment polymorphism is unlikely to exist in this species and that,
   accordingly, such variation is not a consistently predictable feature of
   vision in diurnal strepsirrhines. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Whether animals are active at night or during the day has profound
   consequences for many aspects of their behavioral ecology. Because of
   ecological and physiological trade-offs, most animals, including
   primates, are either strictly nocturnal or diurnal. However, a few
   primate species exhibit cathemeral activity, i.e., their activity is
   irregularly distributed throughout the 24-h cycle. Details and
   determinants of this unusual activity pattern are poorly understood
   because long-term 24-h observations are not feasible in the field. We
   therefore used small data loggers to record the activity of cathemeral
   redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus) from several neighboring groups
   quantitatively and continuously over a complete annual cycle in order to
   evaluate various proposed proximate and ultimate determinants of
   cathemeral activity. Activity data were examined for variation as a
   function of ambient temperature, time of day, lunar phase, and season.
   We found that cathemeral activity occurred year-round and that, on
   average, 3.5 times more activity occurred during the day. Total and
   diurnal activity increased during the long days of the austral summer.
   Nocturnal activity increased during the longer nights of the cool dry
   season. Irrespective of season, lunar phase had a significant effect on
   the distribution of activity across the 24-h cycle, with most nocturnal
   activity recorded during parts of the night with greatest brightness.
   These data indicate that light availability is the primary proximate
   determinant for the patterning of cathemeral activity. Several lines of
   evidence suggest that cathemerality in lemurs has evolved from nocturnal
   ancestors and that it represents a transitory state on the way to the
   diurnal niche.},

Abstract = {The relative efficacies and cardiorespiratory effects of three
   injectable anesthetic combinations containing medetomidine were
   evaluated in ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). In addition, the direct
   effects of medetomidine on heart rate and blood pressure were evaluated
   in lemurs anesthetized with isoflurane. For injectable anesthesia,
   captive adult ring-tailed lemurs were anesthetized with medetomidine and
   ketamine (0.04-0.06 mg/kg, i.m. and 3 mg/kg, i.m., respectively).
   medetomidine, butorphanol, and ketamine (0.04 mg/kg, i.m., 0.4 mg/kg,
   i.m., and 3 mg/kg, i.m., respectively). or medetomidine, butorphanol,
   and midazolam (0.04 mg/kg, i.m., 0.4 mg/kg, i.m., and 0.3 mg/kg, i.m.,
   respectively). For inhalation anesthesia, lemurs were mask-induced and
   maintained with isoflurane for 30 min before receiving medetomidine
   (0.04 mg/kg, i.m.). Sedation produced by medetomidine-ketamine was
   unpredictable and of short duration. Both
   medetomidine-butorphanol-ketamine (MBK) and
   medetomidine-butorphanol-midazolam (MBMz) provided adequate anesthesia
   for routine physical exams; however, the effects of MBMz lasted longer
   than those of MBK. Heart rates and respiratory rates were within
   clinically normal ranges for all groups, and lemurs remained
   normotensive throughout the study. Common side effects such as
   hypertension and bradycardia associated with the use of alpha-adrenergic
   receptor agonist combinations in other species were not observed.
   Likewise, medetomidine administration had no effect on HR in lemurs
   receiving isoflurane. Lemurs in all groups were well ventilated and
   remained well oxygenated throughout the procedures, though arterial
   partial pressure of O-2 was lowest in the MBMz group. All three
   injectable medetomidine combinations were effective in ring-tailed
   lemurs but only MBK and MBMz provided adequate depth and duration of
   anesthesia for use as sole regimes. For many clinical procedures in
   lemurs, MBMz offers advantages over MBK because of its longer duration
   of action and its rapid and more complete reversibility with specific
   antagonists.},

Title = {Endocrine characterization of female reproductive status in wild
   redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus)},
Journal = {GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {131},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {In order to characterize the endocrine changes associated with ovarian
   function and pregnancy in wild redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus),
   profiles of immunoreactive 5alpha-pregnane-3alpha-ol-20-one (5-P-30H)
   and total estrogens (E-t) in feces were generated during the breeding
   season and gestation. HPLC data confirmed the presence of high amounts
   of 5-P-30H in the feces of redfronted lemurs and showed that estrone and
   estradiol-17beta were the major estrogens excreted into feces, with
   estrone predominating. Due to an extreme day-to-day variability in
   excretion of both hormones during the breeding season, estrus cycle
   characterization was not possible for the free-ranging females.
   Comparison with endocrine data from captive animals suggested that this
   might have been associated with a highly variable amount of undigested
   fecal matter in the feces of wild females. A gestation length of 121.3
   days was calculated on the basis of the day of behavioral estrus and
   date of parturition. Hormonally, pregnancy could be reliably diagnosed
   from day 40-45 after conception, when fecal progestogen levels clearly
   increased above breeding season concentrations in all females. Levels
   gradually increased thereafter, with 15- to 35-fold elevated maximum
   levels being reached shortly before parturition. In contrast, the
   pattern of fecal estrogen excretion was strongly related to the sex of
   the fetus in utero, with only females carrying male infants showing
   elevated (25- to 50-fold) estrogen levels during the last third of
   gestation, while levels remained at low breeding season levels in
   female-carrying mothers. Thus, fecal estrogen measurements during the
   last 6-7 weeks of gestation allow fetal sex to be determined prenatally.
   By providing the first data on the reproductive endocrinology of E.
   fulvus, we have shown that fecal hormone analysis is a useful tool to
   monitor endocrine changes associated with pregnancy, while it appears to
   have certain limitations regarding the assessment of ovarian function.

Abstract = {This study reports the molecular and morphologic characterization of a

   verreauxi coquereli. Stool samples were collected from seven animals (n
   = 7) presenting episodes of diarrhea. Bright-field light microscopy of
   stool smears stained with modified acid-fast technique revealed the
   presence of Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts in four of the stool samples
   analyzed. All microscopically positive samples were confirmed by PCR
   using primers designed to amplify DNA fragments from two independent
   loci, i.e. the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene and the
   small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) gene. Phylogenetic analysis based
   on the full-length ssrRNA gene placed this isolate within a clade that
   contains all currently known C parvum species/genotypes, closely related
   to the C parvum pig genotype. Comparison with partial ssrRNA sequences
   available in the GenBank(TM) revealed 100\% sequence identity with the
   genotype previously identified in Canadian patients. This finding was
   confirmed further by comparison of the COWP gene partial sequences.

Abstract = {To estimate fermentative capacity among lemur species, four fiber
   substrates were tested across three species, Eulemur fulvus, Hapalemur
   griseus and Varecia variegata. The substrates, cellulose, beet pulp,
   citrus pulp and citrus pectin, ranged in composition from completely
   insoluble fiber (IF) to completely soluble fiber (SF), respectively. The
   lemurs consumed a nutritionally complete biscuit formulated for primates
   {[}85 g/100 g diet dry matter (DM)] and locally available produce (15
   g/100 g diet DM). Feces were then collected and used to inoculate
   fermentation tubes prefilled with fiber substrates and an anaerobic
   growth medium. Dry matter disappearance (DMD), and acetate, propionate,
   butyrate, and total short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production were
   measured in tubes subjected to 6, 12, 24 or 48 h of fermentation.
   Results were fitted to a logistic growth model. The maximal production
   (MP) time at which production or disappearance is at one-half maximum
   (t(50)) and the fermentation rate at 3 h were calculated. The maximal
   disappearance of DM differed among substrates (citrus pectin > citrus
   pulp > beet pulp; P < 0.0001) and species (E. fulvus > H. griseus > V.
   variegata; P < 0.001). V. variegata reached t(50) for acetate and total
   SCFA production faster than H. griseus or E fulvus (P < 0.02).
   Three-hour production rates of acetate and total SCFA were also greater
   for V. variegata for citrus pulp and citrus pectin (P < 0.01). Few
   species differences were observed for beet pulp. Results provide
   evidence for differences in fermentative capacity and suggest that fiber
   solubility and fermentability should be considered when assessing the
   nutritional management of lemurs.},

Abstract = {In the present study, we recorded all births, immigrations, deaths, and
   emigrations for a population of ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Reserve,
   Madagascar, between September 1989 and August 1999. In September 1989,
   three troops (C, B, and T) inhabited the study area of 14.2 ha. During
   the 10-year period, eight troop divisions, six evictions of females, and
   three troop takeovers of ranges by other troops occurred in and around
   the study area. Consequently, in August 1999, the number of troops in
   the same area increased to six (CX, C1, C2A, C2B, T1, and T2). The
   number of lemurs aged > 1 year increased from 63 to 82, which resulted
   from 204 births, 58 immigrations, 125 deaths, and 118 emigrations. Of
   the 204 newborn lemurs during the study period, 103 died, 44 emigrated
   outside the study area, and 57 remained within the study area. The total
   number of lemurs that emigrated from natal troops was 69 (54 males and
   15 females). Natal males left their troops around the age of 3.
   Non-natal males changed troops after a tenure varying from I to 7 years.
   Survival curves showed a fall in survival rates of both sexes to < 0.5
   between the ages of 2 and 3. For females, the survival rate gradually
   decreased to < 0.2 at the age of 9. On the other hand, due to
   emigration, the survival rate of males could not be determined after the
   age of 5 yr. Since some males attained high-rank at the age of 6 - 10
   yr, the prime age for male ring-tailed lemurs is thought to be around 7
   - 10 yr. Ring-tailed lemurs are essentially female philopatric, because
   all cases of females leaving natal troops resulted from troop divisions
   or forced evictions. Such social changes may have resulted from
   competition among females. All cases of troop divisions or evictions
   occurred in larger troops consisting of greater than or equal to 20
   lemurs, and only a few females could rejoin their troops. When males
   joined such a female-group, a new troop was formed. Although promoted by
   an increase in population, frequent emigrations of females from original
   troops are the characteristics of ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty.},

Year = {2002},
Volume = {54},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Partial exon 2 sequences (202 bp) of the lemur Mhc-DRB genes were
   sequenced. A total of 137 novel sequences were detected in 66 lemurs,
   representing four out of the five extant families. Trans-species
   polymorphisms and even identical sequences were observed not only among
   genera but also among families. Based on the time-scale of lemur
   evolution, these findings suggest that some identical sequences have
   been maintained for more than 40 million years. This is in contrast to
   the evolutionary mode of simian DRB genes, where such identical
   sequences have been retained for at most several million years. To
   explore the reasons behind these unexpected findings, the degree of
   recombination and the synonymous substitution rate in lemurs and simians
   were examined. We found that (1) little difference existed in the extent
   of recombination, (2) frequent recombination occurred within the
   alpha-helix as well as between the beta-pleated sheet and the
   alpha-helix, and (3) the synonymous substitution rate was significantly
   reduced in lemur lineages. Upon phylogenetic analysis, lemur DRB genes
   were clustered by themselves and separated from the other primate DRB
   genes (simians and non-Malagasy prosimians). This result suggests that
   the DRB variations in extant lemur populations have been generated after
   the divergence of the lemurs from the remaining primates. This mode of
   substitution accumulation is also supported by a pattern of mismatch
   distribution among lemur DRB genes. These observations correspond with
   the postulation that a severe bottleneck occurred when the ancestors of
   lemurs settled into Madagascar from the African continent.},

Abstract = {The cranial morphology of Lemur catta and of the five species of the
   genus Eulemur is investigated here by landmark identification and
   Procrustes superimpositions. This geometrical morphometric method makes
   it possible to describe pure shape differences independent of size
   effects, and to quantify differences between specimens. The aim of this
   study is to determine whether the morphological disparity of lemur
   skulls is constrained by the environment and/or by the group's
   phylogenetic history. First, Procrustes residuals are analysed by
   principal component analysis and the scatter-plots interpreted against
   the geographical distributions of taxa to determine whether morphology
   is correlated with geography Then, a morphological distance tree is
   computed and compared with various cladograms reported in the literature
   to test for any correlation between morphology and phylogeny.
   Morphological disparity is found to be closely correlated with
   geographical distribution but independent of phylogeny. This confirms
   that the morphological disparity of lemur skulls is associated with a
   high degree of homoplasy, probably as a result of ecological
   constraints. (C) 2002 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal

Abstract = {Female dominance is unusual among mammals and has been described in
   detail for only a handful of species. Here we present data on the
   frequency and outcome of dominance interactions in seven semi-free
   ranging and captive groups of blue-eyed black lemurs (Eulemur macaco
   flavifrons) housed at the Duke University Primate Center. We collected
   over 260 hours of focal data during which all occurrences of
   dominant-subordinate interactions were recorded. We collected data
   outside the typical breeding and birthing seasons for this species, thus
   eliminating possible confounding factors and increased aggression
   associated with these periods. We found that females were dominant over
   males in all seven groups, with females winning 99\% of all dominance
   interactions. E. in. flavifrons used aggressive dominance (e.g. chase,
   cuff, bite) in 81\% of all interactions, with the remainder of
   interactions being decided using social dominance (e.g. deference in the
   form of supplants or cowers). Older females were dominant over younger
   females in two out of three multi-female groups (in each case, younger
   females were daughters), and younger males (sons of the dominant female)
   received less aggression from females than did older males (n = 2
   groups). Caging and group size appear to play a minimal role in the
   expression of female dominance. While confirmation must await further
   observations on free-ranging groups of E. in. flavifrons, our data
   strongly suggest that this subspecies can be characterized as female
   dominant.},

Abstract = {Pronounced seasonality, with temperatures dropping as low as 5degreesC
   during the dry season, has led to the hypothesis that Malagasy lemurs
   face cold stress and respond to this by inactivity and social
   thermoregulation, i.e. resting in tight body contact with conspecifics.
   Compared to anthropoids, lemur groups are comprised of an unusually high
   number of males, leading to an even or slightly male-biased adult sex
   ratio. According to one hypothesis, females may benefit from these
   surplus males in their groups if males huddle with females. The results
   of this study on redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus) in Kirindy
   Forest, Madagascar revealed that the animals indeed responded to cold
   ambient temperatures by increased inactivity and the formation of
   huddling groups. However, surplus males did not participate more
   frequently than expected in huddling groups with females and females do
   not, therefore, benefit from the high number of males in their groups by
   increased social thermoregulation. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG,

Abstract = {Third-party interventions in conflicts have revealed complexity in
   primate social relationships. This type of intervention has seldom been
   analyzed in prosimians, although many of these species exhibit complex
   (multimale/multifemale) social organizations. The present study on
   captive brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus fulvus) shows that dominant
   individuals were more likely to intervene in conflicts. Both males and
   females intervened aggressively in conflicts. Female aggressive
   interventions occurred mainly on behalf of close kin, whereas males
   mainly intervened on behalf of juveniles. This study also provides the
   first record of neutral or peaceful interventions in lemurs. Although
   females intervened neutrally, almost all neutral interventions were by
   dominant males. Dominant males intervened in conflicts neutrally more
   often than agressively, principally in conflicts between adults and
   juveniles or between juveniles. Neutral interventions by males always
   ended the conflicts and were often followed by affiliative contacts
   between participants (intervenors and opponents). In lemurs, female
   interventions can be explained by kin selection, while the nature of
   dominant males' interventions suggests a control role. Interventions by
   males on behalf of juveniles may increase the formers' fitness. (C) 2002

   the island, we estimate that the lemur population now numbers
   42,000-72,000. The decline observed in 1987 may have been largely caused
   by the cyclone that devastated Mayotte in 1984. That the population has
   recovered must not obscure the fact that loss of forest, increased human
   pressure associated with further development of infrastructure, and
   changes in agricultural practices will undoubtedly continue to affect

Abstract = {The genetic structure of a population is closely connected to
   fundamental evolutionary processes and aspects of social behavior.
   Information on genetic structure is therefore instrumental for the
   interpretation of social behavior and evolutionary reconstructions of
   social systems. Gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) are basal
   primates endemic to Madagascar whose social organization is
   characterized by solitary foraging at night and communal resting during
   the day. Conflicting reports about population structure based on
   behavioral observations led us to examine the genetic structure of one
   population in detail in order to: (1) identify natural genetic units in
   this solitary primate, and (2) to test the assumption of current models
   of primate social evolution that solitary primates are organized in
   matrilines. DNA was extracted from tissue samples of 85 individuals from
   Kirindy forest to determine their variability at a 530 bp fragment of
   the mitochondrial D-loop and at six microsatellite loci. We found that
   this population was characterized by a great general diversity among
   mtDNA haplotypes, a pronounced sex difference in mtDNA haplotype
   diversity and spatial clustering of females with a particular haplotype,
   but low average relatedness among members of haplotype clusters.
   Specifically. we identified 13 different haplotypes, which were unevenly
   distributed among individuals. About 80\% of all individuals, most of
   which were females or juvenile males, shared a single haplotype. Rare
   haplotypes were almost exclusively represented by single adult males,
   who apparently migrated into this population. One other haplotype was
   represented by a small group of females living at one edge of the study
   area. Microsatellite analysis revealed above-average relatedness among
   females with overlapping home ranges, as well as no signs of inbreeding,
   implying that male dispersal results in high levels of gene flow among
   matrilineal groups. We conclude that gray mouse lemur populations are
   hierarchically organized in small family units of closely related
   females that form stable sleeping groups, several of which are connected
   through a common mtDNA haplotype and form spatially distinct clusters.
   The presence of such matrilines supports a basic assumption of current
   models of primate social evolution.},

Abstract = {We conducted a long-terra research project (1996-1999) on developmental
   aspects of olfactory behavior in ring-tailed lemurs to document the
   ontogenetic sequence of olfactory behavior; including the possible
   presence of sexual differences, and the maturation of scent-marking. The
   subjects were a group of 18 lemurs housed in the Pistoia Zoo (Tuscany,
   Italy), which we observed during 1,735 h via all-occurrences sampling
   scan-animals sampling and ad libitum sampling methods. We determined the
   time sequence of olfactory exploration and of scent-marking patterns,
   and investigated sexual differences in timing and frequency. We also
   followed the development of scent-marking through the juvenile and
   adolescent phases taking into account the two aspects of motor control
   and of the acquisition of social competence. On the whole, we found that
   olfactory investigation appears and,,natures earlier than scent-marking.
   Moreover, olfactory investigation of conspecifics appeared later than
   substrate exploration, and seemed to follow a sequence of increasing
   level of acceptance by the receiver. Social play is very important for
   the maturation of the gestural component of scent-marking. The olfactory
   behavioral pattern appeared to nature during the juvenile and adolescent
   phases. Although sexual maturation had obvious influence on the
   development of olfactory behavior, the onset of scent-marking patterns
   was only partially parallel to sexual maturation.},

Abstract = {Fourteen nuclear microsatellite loci were isolated from a genomic DNA
   library derived from a free-ranging bamboo lemur (Hapalemur griseus
   griseus) from Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. Expected and
   observed heterozygosity levels were determined for populations of bamboo
   lemurs from Ranomafana National Park and a nonprotected area near
   Tsinjoarivo, Madagascar. Although genotype frequencies for all but one
   marker were within Hardy-Weinberg expectations for the Tsinjoarivo
   population, this was not the case for the Ranomafana samples. It is
   probable that the deviation of genotype frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg
   expectations in Ranomafana was precipitated by the presence of two taxa

Abstract = {Two young black and white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata variegata)
   died at the San Diego Zoo (San Diego, California, USA) with extensive
   liver lesions suggestive of acute viral infection. Immunoassays
   performed to detect hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers were negative.
   Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers overlapping the HBV core gene
   produced in amplicon of approximately 411 base pairs (bp) from serum DNA
   of a HBV-positive western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) but
   not from serum DNA of either lemur. Cesium chloride gradient fractions
   of liver homogenates from both lemurs contained a peak protein fraction
   with a density of 1.18 g/cm(3). Electron microscopic analysis of
   fraction contents, concentrated by ultracentrifugation, revealed
   numerous pleomorphic, spherical particles varying in diameter from 16-25
   nm. In one of the lemurs, this peak fraction also contained a
   double-shelled virus-like particle 47-50 nm in diameter. The size,
   morphology, and density of these particles suggest they are members of
   the Hepadnaviridae, a group of hepatotropic DNA-genome viruses for which

Abstract = {Data are presented on dental and general health for seven groups of wild
   ring-tailed lemurs, Lemur catta, from the Beza Mahafaly Reserve, in
   southern Madagascar. As part of a study of population demography, adults
   were captured, collared, and tagged, and biometric measurements, dental
   casts, and analyses of dental and general health were made. Results
   indicate that patterns of dental health vary by individual, age, sex,
   and habitat. Prime adults show more dental attrition than young adults.
   Prime males living in more marginal habitats show greater mean attrition
   than those living in richer habitats. Dental damage, specifically to the
   toothcomb, indicates that mechanical stresses to this region may include
   the initial harvesting of foods, in addition to grooming. Males exhibit
   more evidence of past trauma, including scars and chipped teeth. These
   results indicate that environmental as well as social factors, such as
   female dominance, may lead to sex differences in health patterns among
   lemurs. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Ambatorongorongo Mountain lies at the historical intersection between
   humid, spiny, and littoral forests in southeastern Madagascar. We report
   the results of surveys of the herpetofauna and lemurs occurring in
   Malahelo Forest, a small (<25 ha) forest fragment lying on the western
   slope of Ambatorongorongo Mountain. There are at least 41 reptile, 11
   amphibian, and 7 lemur species in this forest, including several that
   are endemic to southeastern Madagascar and are at severe risk of
   extinction. The species richness of the Malahelo fauna is comparable to
   that of even the largest forest reserves in the region. We also evaluate
   the similarity of the Malahelo herpetofauna to that of nearby humid,
   spiny, and littoral forests to assess the biogeographic affinities of
   its amphibians and reptile assemblages. Both groups contain species
   characteristic of each of the three surrounding forest types, but the
   biogeographic patterns appear to differ for amphibians and reptiles.
   Overall, the herpetofauna and lemurs of the Malahelo Forest indicate
   that it is a remnant of a biogeographic transition zone between the
   major forest types of southeastern Madagascar. The combination of high
   species richness, regional endemics, and unique herpetofaunal and lemur
   assemblages should make Malahelo Forest a high conservation priority,
   and we give recommendations for protecting what remains of this
   important transitional forest.},

Journal = {AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR},

Abstract = {Although the brown lemur (Eulemar fulvus) and the black lemur (Eulemur
   macaco) share many life parameters and are genetically closed, they show
   considerable difference in social organization. Dominance relationships
   with no systematic effect of gender characterize the former, whereas the
   latter is based on female dominance. The present study was done on two
   captive groups of brown lemurs and one semi-free-ranging group of black
   lemurs. To reveal links between the specific pattern of social
   organization and agonistic behaviors, agonistic interactions were
   analyzed for each species as for their context of occurrence, symmetry,
   initiation, and outcome. The effect of gender in the initiation of
   conflicts appeared as the only notable interspecific difference,
   aggression being mostly initiated by females in E. macaco and by males
   in E. fulvus. Conflict outcome was generally in favor of the initiator,
   regardless of gender in both species. The analysis of postconflict
   behaviors revealed conciliatory processes in the brown lemur, whereas
   reconciliation seemed to be absent in the black lemur, a characteristic
   shared with the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), another lemur species
   with female dominance. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   sex-specific differences in the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus)},

Abstract = {The grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) has a dispersed social
   structure, within which female sleeping associations are common. These
   sleeping associations have been hypothesised to confer anti-predatory
   and thermoregulatory benefits, especially when rearing offspring. The
   genetic composition of these associations was determined using
   microsatellite markers to test predictions derived from kin selection
   theory. 161 (99 males, 62 females) individual M. murinus belonging to a
   free-living population in Ampijoroa, north-western Madagascar, were
   genotyped and observed over a total of 13 months distributed over the
   dry seasons of 3 successive years (1995-1997). Kin selection theory
   predicts that these female associations should consist of closely
   related members, and that female philopatry and male natal dispersal
   should characterise the dispersal pattern within this species. These
   predictions were confirmed by the data. Five out of six female sleeping
   groups consisted of one or more closely related dyads. Females that
   slept alone did not have close female kin in the vicinity or within the
   population at all. Closely related female dyads lived in significantly
   closer proximity than closely related male dyads and closely related
   male-female dyads showed intermediate proximity. In combination with the
   result that females possessed significantly more relatives within the
   population than males, these findings support the behavioural.
   hypotheses of female philopatry and male natal dispersal. Matrilinear
   grouping patterns and sex-biased dispersal are therefore genetically
   established in a dispersed primate social organisation for the first
   time. The results further indicate that several generations of mouse
   lemurs live together within a given area, implying both an effective
   mechanism of kin recognition to avoid father-daughter incest and the
   potential for social learning to ensure individual recognition.},

Title = {Fruit characteristics of species dispersed by the black lemur (Eulemur

Abstract = {I describe the fruit characteristics of species closely associated with
   black lemur seed dispersal (i,e., species that are often dispersed by
   the black lemur and only dispersed by the black lemur in the Lokobe
   Forest). A black lemur group was habituated and observed during the day
   and night for all months of the year (total 1272 h). When fruits were
   eaten, the plant species was identified, the maturity of the fruit and
   treatment of the seeds noted, and the fruit described in terms of ripe
   fruit color, husk thickness, fruit length, and seed length and width.
   Black lemur feces were searched for seeds; these were identified and
   signs of damage noted. Other potential dispersers feeding on the fruits
   of species eaten by the black lemur were also noted. The black lemurs
   were seen eating the fruits of 70 species, Of these, 51 species were
   defined as closely associated with black lemur dispersal and 16 species
   had seeds that were either often preyed upon or wasted by the black
   lemur, or were seen being eaten by other potential seed dispersers.
   Fruits of species in the former group were often dull colored (94\% of
   species); rarely less than 1 cm long (6\%); rarely had seeds less than
   0,1 cm long or less than 0.1 cm Wide (2 and 4\%, respectively); never
   had seeds more than 4 cm long or greater than 2 cm wide; and quite often
   had either thick husks (49\%) or thin husks (51\%). In contrast, the
   fruits of the latter group were often brightly colored (75\% of species)
   and nearly always had a thin husk (94\%). Also, this latter group
   included more small and very large fruits and seeds than the former
   group. Fruit characteristics significantly associated with the former
   group Were: dull color, thick husk, fruit length greater than 2 cm, seed
   length 1-4 cm, and seed width 1-2 cm. The extent to which these traits
   are the result of coevolution between plants and the guild of lemur
   dispersers that includes the black lemur is not clear, but a coevolved
   lemur-fruit syndrome remains a possibility.},

Abstract = {Female dominance or female feeding priority seem to be characteristic
   for many lemur species, but are rare traits in other primates and
   mammals in general. The nocturnal lemur species, however, are
   underrepresented in the quantitative studies on social dominance. The
   aim of this study is to investigate the pattern of intersexual dominance
   relationships in the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), a species
   that is generally thought to possess a number of ancestral lemur traits.
   The context, distribution, and outcome of intersexual conflicts are
   analyzed in four captive groups of gray mouse lemurs. Intersexual
   conflicts occurred in the study groups in different behavioral contexts
   and were mostly spatial interactions (chasing/fleeing,
   approach/avoidance). The majority of conflicts were decided, and were in
   all but one case won by females. This is the first evidence suggesting
   unconditional female dominance in a cheirogaleid primate. The existence
   of female dominance in most families of the Lemuriformes suggests it is
   an ancient trait that evolved in their common ancestor. (C) 2001

Abstract = {In the Berenty Reserve, Southern Madagascar, of the 16 deliveries
   recorded for ring-tailed lemurs from 1995 and 1997, 10 cases occurred
   during daytime hours (07:00 - 16:59). Four mothers lost contact with
   their troop members during parturition, but were able to rejoin them
   after about one hour. No attack from the individuals of the neighboring
   groups or predators on the mothers or their newborn infants was
   observed, whereas, other females of the mother's own troop attacked them
   after delivery in two cases. Such daytime delivery may have originated
   from the circadian rhythm of the species' nocturnal ancestors, who might
   have given birth during the daytime. This pattern may now be a
   non-adaptive feature, in agreement with the ``evolutionary
   disequilibrium hypothesis (EVDH).{''}},

Volume = {54},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Nocturnal primate species are often difficult to discriminate by gross
   visual bodily characteristics. This is also true for the world's
   smallest primate taxon, the Malagasy mouse lemurs. Recent findings imply
   that this taxon contains sibling species that can be diagnosed
   noninvasively by their species-specific advertisement call. We used
   comparative bioacoustics in order to explore variation of this call type
   and to assess species status of three European colonies. Acoustic
   variation was compared within and between colonies as well as with known
   species-specific differences. It was further related to morphological
   and genetic variations to investigate in how far it covaries with them.
   Results show that acoustic and genetic differences revealed by random
   amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting separated colonies
   reliably, but were on a different level than known species-specific
   differences. A Mantel test showed that acoustic differences were weakly
   correlated to genetic, but not to morphological differences. Our study
   is the first to reveal that both acoustic signaling and genetics clearly
   establish the species status for nocturnal primate populations. It also
   suggests that acoustic traits change at a more obvious and rapid pace
   than morphology in isolated populations, and may be used as an
   indication of conditions that may favor the evolution of subspecies. (C)

Abstract = {A 14.5-yr-old. male black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegatus
   variegatus) presented for acute enlargement of the left testicle and
   hemiscrotum. Physical examination also revealed poor pelage quality with
   short guard hairs, sparse undercoat, and areas of alopecia. Increased
   aggression was also reported. A unilateral, open orchiectomy was
   performed, with the left testicle. epidydymis, associated vaginal tunic,
   and attached spermatic cord removed. Microscopic evaluation was
   consistent with an interstitial cell tumor. with many morphologic
   features similar to this neoplasm in people. No overt histopathologic
   criteria of malignancy were present. Following orchiectomy, gradual
   improvement in pelage quality was noted and was considered almost normal
   by 5 mo postoperative. In contrast with the aggressive preoperative
   behavior, the lemur was extremely submissive for 3 mo following the
   surgery. Gradual return to normal behavior and social status occurred
   over the next 2 mo. Multiple follow-up examinations and radiographs
   revealed no evidence of metastasis. and biopsy of the remaining testicle
   4 mo later revealed no evidence of neoplasia. Serial measurements of
   testosterone and estradiol revealed levels within the range of those for
   other ruffed lemurs, as were repeated measurements taken of the
   remaining testicle. At 19 mo postoperative, the lemur had a coat quality
   considered nearly normal and maintained its historical social position

Abstract = {The results of a field census of Alaotran gentle lemurs Hapalemur
   griseus alaotrensis carried out in February and March 1999 are reported.
   The results are compared with a census carried out a years earlier in
   1994. Both censuses followed the same methods and were carried out by
   the same team, using direct observation from canoe. Mean group encounter
   rates for the lemur were assessed in each location, which allowed us to
   calculate the relative group density in each site. Qualitative
   information on habitat condition (on the basis of plant diversity,
   vegetation height and evidence of burning) was gathered at each site.
   Additional inforamtion mainly on lemur hunting, was acquired through
   interviews with local people. In most sites group encounter rate was at
   least 50 per cent lower than 5 years before. Taking into account
   unusually low water levels because of a drought at Lac Alaotra in 1999,
   we estimate that these encounter rates reflect a 30 per cent decline in
   the total population size over the last 5 years. The main cause of this
   dramatic decrease was human-induced fire (habitat degradation) coupled
   with heavy hunting (poaching of lemurs for food). The importance of
   assessing regularly both population status and threats, and of adjusting
   conservation actions accordingly is emphasized.},

Abstract = {A neonate male owl monkey (Aotus sp.) was identified cytogenetically as
   a hybrid after it failed to nurse and died. Phenotypically, the male
   parent possessed characteristics of the ``gray-neck group,{''} and
   G-banded karyotypes identified him as Aotus lemurinus griseimembra (2n =
   53). heterozygous for the centric fusion of chromosomes 13 and 14. The
   female parent belonged to the ``red-neck group{''} and was identified
   cytogenetically as Aotus nancymaae (2n = 54) The neonate hybrid had 2n
   54 chromosomes with 13 homologous pairs of autosomes, 26 nonhomologous
   autosomes, and XY sex chromosomes. Thirteen of the nonhomologous
   chromosomes represented the paternal complement, and 13 were from the
   maternal complement. Chromosomal rearrangements occurring between the
   karyotypes of A. i. griseimembra and A. nancymaae were believed to
   include two paracentric inversions. a reciprocal translocation. and two
   complex rearrangements involving pericentric inversion, telocentromeric
   fusion, and centromeric adjustment. Cytogenetic analyses are necessary
   to identify most Aotus taxa and thus should be utilized to pair
   chromosomally compatible animals and avoid interspecies hybridization.},

Abstract = {Within this study seven polymorphic microsatellite primers were
   developed for the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) from two partial
   genomic libraries. One protocol was based on an initial polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers and
   resulted in a 5.5\% enrichment, whereas the second protocol included an
   enrichment with three rounds of capture which yielded a 38.0\%
   enrichment. The genotypes of 12 captive and 162 free-living animals were
   determined with the newly developed primers and all seven confirmed
   Mendelian inheritance. All primers amplified in several species of the
   family Cheirogaleidae, demonstrating their general suitability for
   microsatellite analyses within this taxonomic group.},

Abstract = {Detailed descriptions of the dentition of many strepsirhine primate taxa
   are rare, despite their importance in understanding primate evolutionary
   biology. While several researchers have provided detailed morphological
   descriptions of ring-tailed lemur dentition (e.g., Schwartz and
   Tattersall {[}1985] Am. Mus. Nat. Hist. Anthropol. Pap. 60:1-100;
   Tattersall and Schwartz {[}1991] Am. Mus. Nat. Hist. Anthropol. Pap.
   69:2-18), there are few studies (e.g., Eaglen {[}1986] Am. J. Phys.
   Anthropol. 71:185-201) that present quantitative data on the dentition
   of this species. Furthermore, prior analyses were based on museum
   specimens from various populations and locations. We present here
   quantitative and morphological data on the dentition of a population of
   wild Lemur catta from Beta Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar.
   Measurements were made on dental casts (n = 39) taken from living
   members of this L, catta population. Our analysis indicates that no
   significant (P > 0.05) sexual dimorphism exists for the 30 dental
   measurements collected. These data support the generalizations (e.g.,
   Plavcan and van Schaik {[}1994] Evol. Anthropol. 2:208-214; Kappeler
   {[}1996] J. Evol. Biol. 9:43-65) that little sexual dimorphism in
   dentition exists among Malagasy strepsirhines. In addition, the overall
   patterns of metric variation in this sample compare favorably with
   patterns seen among other primates, e.g., premolar measurements varying
   more than molars (e.g., Gingerich {[}1974] J. Paleontol. 48:895-903).
   However, there is a degree of intraspecific morphological variation
   indicated, with one of the morphological traits discussed in other
   studies as being species-specific for L. catta (absence of P(4)
   metaconids) observed to vary between specimens. Because the patterns of
   variation seen in this sample are from a known breeding population, the
   data presented here provide an important reference for interpreting and
   understanding the fossil record. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {From 1989 to 1998, 204 live births were recorded for ring-tailed lemurs
   (Lemur catta) at Berenty, Madagascar. Excluding unknown birth dates, the
   peak month of birth was September, with 82.0\% (146/178) occurring
   during this period. The offspring sex ratio (1:1.19) was not
   significantly different from 1:1, and there was no association with the
   mother's age. The first births occurred at the ages of 2 to 4 yr. The
   annual birth rate was very low at the ago of 2 yl (11.1\%), but
   increased thereafter: to 50.0\% at the age of 3 yr, and to 75-85\% at
   the age of 4 or more years. Multiple births were very rare, since only
   three sets of twins and one set of triplets were recorded. As for the
   interbirth interval, a one-year interval was the most common (92.2\%).
   Infant mortality within the first year was 37.7\% (77/204). Neonatal
   mortality within the first month accounted for 31.2\% of all infant

Abstract = {Qualitative observations in several European zoos revealed a high
   proportion of obese individuals in different species of lemurs. This
   phenomenon was examined in both subspecies of the ruffed lemur (Varecia
   variegata variegata and Varecia variegata rubra). Data on body weight
   were obtained from 43 animals in 13 European zoos and were compared with
   body weights of wild ruffed lemurs. The captive individuals' mean weight
   was significantly higher than either of two different samples of wild V.
   variegata variegata. Using a weight-based definition of obesity, 46.5\%
   of the individuals in our sample were obese. Neither significant
   differences in body weight between the two subspecies nor between sexes
   could be found. Body weight did not correlate with age.
   The findings are discussed with reference to the feeding ecology of
   ruffed lemurs and their nutrition in captivity and to implications for
   captive breeding programs for this species. Zoo Biol 20:261-269, 2001.

Abstract = {Cheirogaleids are one of the most primitive extant primate taxa in the
   world. Their lifestyle and mating system, therefore, have been
   considered to be representative for social systems in primate ancestors.
   Accepted models of social evolution in primates state that pair-bonding
   has evolved secondarily from diurnal group-living taxa and should
   therefore be constrained primarily to diurnal species. In contrast to
   these assumptions, the nocturnal fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus
   medius) lives in permanent pairs, with obligate paternal care probably
   representing the evolutionary basis of pair-living. In this
   sociobiological field study, we analyzed the reproduction strategy of C.
   medius in the tropical forest of western Madagascar. In the rainy
   seasons from 1995 to 1999, 173 individuals of C. medius were captured
   and individually marked and 131 were genetically characterized through
   seven microsatellite loci. Additionally, 36 of these individuals were
   radio-tracked and observed. For 53 genotyped individuals, including 16
   offspring, information about pair-bonding and family structure was known
   from field observations. Genetic analyses revealed that yearlings and
   infants living with an adult pair were in all cases sibs of the social
   mother. However, C. medius does not restrain from extra-pair copulations
   (EPCs) and a high rate of extra-pair paternity (44\%) was detected.
   Males sired offspring with their female partners as well as with
   extra-pair females within the same year, indicating that males may
   increase their reproductive success by EPCs without necessarily running
   the risk of cuckoldry. Females on the other hand do not seem to run the
   risk of reduced paternal care, either because males cannot detect
   relatedness of young, or because they might even increase their
   inclusive fitness by raising offspring of closely related males. Since
   females reproduce preferentially with territory holders and no paternity
   could be assigned to floating males, superior genetic quality of the
   males might be crucial for female choice.},

Abstract = {Two species of dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus) of Madagascar are

   (hairy or naked), ear size, tail length, skull shape and dentition. As
   multiple features differentiate each form, they cannot be simply morphs
   within the two conventional species: they are discrete genetic entities,
   hence distinct species. The Cheirogaleus medius species group is split
   into two closely related allopatric species, C. medius from the western
   dry forests and C. adipicaudatus from the southern spiny forest. The
   Cheirogaleus major group has two widespread and partially sympatric
   species: C. major from the lowland rain forests and C. crossleyi from
   the plateau margins. I describe a species previously known only from the

Abstract = {We aimed to investigate the pattern of utilisation of torpor and its
   impact on energy budgets in free-living grey mouse femurs (Microcebus
   murinus), a small nocturnal primate endemic to Madagascar. We measured
   daily energy expenditure (DEE) and water turnover using doubly labelled
   water, and we used temperature-sensitive radio collars to measure skin
   temperature (T-sk) and home range. Our results showed that male and
   female mouse lemurs in the wild enter torpor spontaneously over a wide
   range of ambient temperatures (T-a) during the dry season, but not
   during the rainy season. Mouse lemurs remained torpid between 1.7-8.9 h
   with a daily mean of 3.4 h. and their T-sk s fell to a minimum of 18.8
   degreesC. Mean home ranges of mouse lemurs which remained normothermic
   were similar in the rainy and dry season. During the dry season? the
   mean home range of mouse lemurs showing daily torpor was significantly
   smaller than that of animals remaining normothermic. The DEE of M.
   murinus remaining normothermic in the rainy season (122 +/- 65.4 kJ
   day(-1)) was about the same of that of normothermic mouse lemurs in the
   dry season (115.5 +/- 27.3 kJ day(-1)). During the dry season, the mean
   DEE of M. murinus that utilised daily torpor was 103.4 +/- 32.7 kJ
   day(-1) which is not significantly different from the mean DEE of
   animals remaining normothermic. We found that the DEE of mouse lemurs
   using daily torpor was significantly correlated with the mean
   temperature difference between T-sk and T-a (r(2) = 0.37) and with
   torpor bout length (r(2) = 0.46), while none of these factors explained
   significant amounts of variation in the DEE of the mouse lemurs
   remaining normothermic. The mean water flux rate of mouse lemurs using
   daily torpor (13.0 +/- 4.1 ml day(-1)) was significantly lower than that
   of mouse lemurs remaining normothermic (19.4 +/- 3.8 ml day(-1)),
   suggesting the lemurs conserve water by entering torpor. Thus, this
   first study on the energy budget of free-ranging M. murinus demonstrates
   that torpor may not only reflect its impact on the daily energy demands,
   but involve wider adaptive implications such as water requirements.},

Abstract = {The objective of this project was to better define the similarities and
   differences in gastrointestinal morphology present in lemur species.
   Measurements of the gastrointestinal tract of lemurs were obtained at
   necropsy from the captive population at Duke University Primate Center.
   Measurements of body length and weight, as well as gastrointestinal
   length, were recorded from five prosimian species: Propithecus
   tattersalli, Propithecus verreauxi, Varecia variegata, Hapalemur
   griseus, and Lemur catta. Photographs and measurements were used to
   obtain illustrations. Preliminary results suggest differences in
   gastrointestinal morphology among lemur species that coincide with
   differences in diet. Distinct sacculations in either the cecum or the
   colon were present for H. griseus, L. catta, P. verreauxi, and P.
   tattersalli, but not for V. variegata. The Propithecus specimens
   possessed a much greater ratio of gastrointestinal length to body length
   than the other three species. A short, blunt cecum and a shortened and
   sacculated colon were unique characteristics of the H. griseus
   specimens. These differences correlate well with a dietary shift from
   consumption of large amounts of structural plant cell wall (Propithecus
   sp.) to consumption of variable or moderate amounts (H. griseus, L.
   catta, and V. variegata). They also suggest that captive groups would
   benefit from further diet refinement in captivity. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {In December 1992 an infant ringtailed lemur, approximately 7 weeks of
   age, was orphaned in one of the regularly-censused social groups at the
   Beza-Mahafaly Reserve, southwestern Madagascar. The infant was initially
   adopted by a subadult (2 yr-old) male from the group. Continuous-time
   focal animal data were collected for a 12-hr period, from the time that
   the infant was retrieved by the young male, in order to document the
   adoption process. Ten members of the infant's social group (total group
   number = 18) engaged in infant care behaviors over the 12-hr period. The
   subadult male spent the most time engaged in infant care, and he and one
   adult female exhibited the highest frequency of caregiving behaviors
   over the 12-hr period (p< 0.001). Four adult males also initially cared
   for the infant. The orphan was one of only six infants in the reserve
   population to survive that year. She was censused two years later as an
   adolescent member of her natal group. Adaptive explanations for this
   adoption vary depending upon the caregiver. For the subadult male and
   adult female caregivers, kin selection can be suggested, as the infant
   was related to all females and immature animals in the group. Adult
   males may have exhibited caregiving behaviors as a strategy related to
   affiliation with adult females which could lead to potential mating and
   reproductive success.},

Abstract = {Advertisement calls are often important noninvasive tools for

   speciation patterns in nature. We investigated the contribution of these
   calls to uncover specific diversity in nocturnal Malagasy lemurs. We
   compared sexual advertisement and predator advertisement calls of two
   mouse lemur species, western gray and eastern rufous mouse lemurs
   (Microcebus murinus and M. rufus, respectively) living in two
   contrasting habitats (dry deciduous vs. rain forest), and analyzed them
   statistically Both species en emitted several highly variable whistle
   calls in the context of predator-avoidance. Intrapopulation variation
   was high and overlapped interspecific variation. Sexual advertisement
   calls, given in the mating context, displayed a totally distinct,
   species-specific acoustic structure. Whereas gray mouse lemurs produced
   rapidly multifrequency modulated, long trill calls, rufous mouse lemurs
   gave slowly frequency-modulated short chirp calls. Our results suggest
   specific status for gray and rufous mouse lemurs and indicate the
   importance of predation and social needs in shaping vocal communication.},

Abstract = {In order to assess the status of lemurs along the lower reaches of the
   Mahavavy in north-west Madagascar, we carried out transect line sampling
   at Anjamena between April and August 1995. These data were complemented
   by additional absence-presence surveys conducted in 1994 and 1995 in
   many of the remaining forested areas of the region. This is the first
   study of lemur population density estimates for the faunal subregion
   between the rivers Mahavavy and Betisboka. Six sympatric lemurs are
   found at Anjamena: Cheirogaleus medius, Eulemur fulvus rufus, E. mongoz,
   Lepilemur sp., Microcebus murinus and Propithecus verreauxi coronatus.
   Data suggest that in some parts of the region large numbers of lemurs
   may still be found (E. f. rufus 121 individuals per km(2), E. mongoz
   (45), Lepilemur sp. (110), M. murinus (85) and P. v. coronatus (173)).
   No density data are provided for C. medius. In conclusion, as high lemur
   population densities may still be found and, in particular, P. v.
   coronatus is not known to exist in any protected area, Anjamena could
   serve as an important addition to the protected area system of
   north-west Madagascar.},

Abstract = {The brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus) include seven subspecies, whose
   evolutionary relationships remain contentious. In particular, it is
   unclear whether the Malagasy and Comorian E. f. fulvus populations are
   differentiated at the subspecific level (E. f. mayottensis).
   Furthermore, it has been suggested that E. f. collaris and E. f.
   albocollaris are separate species. Analyses of similar to 2400 bp of
   mitochondrial DNA sequence data from part of the COIII gene, together
   with complete genes for ND3, ND4L, and ND4 and 5 tRNAs, resolved 34 E.
   fulvus specimens into six clades: ((albocollaris, collaris) (rufus
   (rufus (fulvus/mayottensis (albifronsl fulvus/sanfordi))))). Based on
   the information available and our analyses we conclude that E. f.
   albocollaris and E. f. collaris do not represent species distinct from
   E. fulvus and that Comorian brown lemurs do not deserve subspecific
   rank. No genetic differentiation was detected between E. f. albifrons
   and E. f. sanfordi; on the other hand, there are obviously two separate
   lineages of E. f. rufus. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

   display phenotypic and ecological characteristics that are unusual for
   the monotypic genus Lemur, thus raising the possibility that they are

   Andringitra should be considered a distinct species. The results
   indicate that taxonomic revision is not warranted under the expectations
   of the phylogenetic, coalescent, or biological species concepts. Rather,
   the genetic patterns observed among the Andringitra and lowland

   Surprisingly, it is found as a polymorphism exactly in a species

   several questions. First, is the truncated octarepeat structure we
   describe, consisting of two octarepeats, still functional in copper
   binding? A second question is whether this truncation is related to the
   remarkable oral infectibility of lemurs with BSE-derived prions. And
   finally, one could argue that this genotype alone might favour
   development of a prion disease, even in the absence of exogenous
   infection.},

Abstract = {To determine how the birth and development of infants influence their
   mothers' social relationships with other adult troop members, we
   observed two free-ranging troops of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) at
   the Berenty Reserve, Madagascar. The number of acts of affiliative
   contact that the mothers received from other adult troop members during
   the first and second months of infant life were significantly higher
   than those before they gave birth, and the values during the third month
   were as low as that before giving birth. Two mothers received acts of
   affiliative contact less frequently after their infants died, compared
   with the values while the infants were alive. On the other hand, more
   than 95\% of all acts of licking of infants by adult troop members other
   than their mothers occurred when the infants were in contact with their
   mothers. These findings suggest that infants per se and mothers per se
   were not attractive, but rather the mother-infant pair was attractive to
   other troop members. Acts of infant-licking were observed in almost all
   mother-mother pairs and mother-non-mother adult female pairs, and in two
   thirds of mother-adult male pairs. Moreover, the frequency of
   infant-licking was not affected by female parity, female and male
   dominance rank, or infant sex. Therefore, acts of infant-licking, which
   are widespread among troop members, may function to make or maintain
   stable social relationships. Am. J. Primatol. 50:187-203, 2000. (C) 2000

Abstract = {Thermoregulation, energetics and patterns of torpor in the pygmy mouse
   lemur, Microcebus myoxinus, were investigated under natural conditions
   of photoperiod and temperature in the Kirindy/CFPF Forest in western
   Madagascar, M. myoxinus entered torpor spontaneously during the cool dry
   season. Torpor only occurred on a daily basis and torpor bout duration
   was on average 9.6 h, and ranged from 4.6 h to 19.2 h. Metabolic rates
   during torpor were reduced to about 86\% of the normothermic value.
   Minimum body temperature during daily torpor was 6.8 degrees C at an
   ambient temperature of 6.3 degrees C. Entry into torpor occurred
   randomly between 2000 and 0620 hours, whereas arousals from torpor were
   clustered around 1300 hours within a narrow time window of less than 4
   h. Arousal from torpor was a two-step process with a first passive climb
   of body temperature to a mean of 27 degrees C, carried by the daily
   increase of ambient temperature when oxygen consumption remained more or
   less constant, followed by a second active increase of oxygen
   consumption to further raise the body temperature to normothermic
   values. In conclusion, daily body temperature rhythms in M. myoxinus
   further reduce the energetic costs of daily torpor seen in other
   species: they extend to unusually low body temperatures and consequently
   low metabolic rates in torpor, and they employ passive warming to reduce
   the energetic costs of arousal, Thus, these energy-conserving
   adaptations may represent an important energetic aid to the pygmy mouse
   lemur and help to promote their individual fitness.},

Abstract = {The most extreme adaptations to seasonal food scarcity and low ambient

   present overview, I reviewed information on daily and prolonged torpor
   of the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). Specifically, I related
   the occurrence of seasonal changes in body mass, metabolic rate, body
   temperature and energy expenditure to changes in external conditions.
   Furthermore, I discussed the relation between seasonality and life
   history traits. This study revealed that torpor in this species may not
   only reflect its impact on the energy demands, but involve much wider
   adaptive implications such as water requirements. The function of torpor
   appeared to vary among individuals and has a strong influence on the
   population dynamics of M. murinus.},

Abstract = {Seasonal fattening in preparation for the dry season followed by torpor
   characterizes some members of the family Cheirogaleidae, a group of <
   600g nocturnal Malagasy primates. These behaviors are associated with
   extreme seasonality in dry forests, where most studies have been
   conducted. I aimed to determine if the brown mouse lemur (Microcebus
   rufus), a rain-forest species of cheirogaleid, exhibited similar
   changes. Between January 1993 and May 1994 I conducted a mark-recapture
   study on Microcebus rufus in the rain forest of Ranomafana National
   Park. I monitored body weight and tail circumference for body fat
   fluctuations and inferred changes in activity levels from presence or
   absence in the traps. Some individuals of both sexes increased body fat
   and entered torpor as suggested by their absence from traps for at least
   I month of the dry season. Activity was resumed with body weight reduced
   by 5-35 g, and tail circumference by 0.4-1.2 cm. Population-level
   analysis supports these results; highest weight and tail circumference
   values occurred just before and at the onset of the dry season. Other
   individuals, predominantly male, exhibited no change in body fat or
   activity level, and some mouse lemurs increased their body fat over the
   course of the dry season. Age, social status, and individual response
   may influence seasonal behavioral strategies. Dry and rain-forest
   species of mouse lemur adopt similar behaviors to cope with
   environmental stresses. Mouse lemurs resemble nonprimate, small-bodied
   mammals, in which behavioral changes related to maintaining energy
   balance occur during seasonally unfavorable conditions.},

Abstract = {Increased non-heme iron levels in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD)
   patients are higher than the levels observed in age matched normal
   subjects. Iron level in structures that are highly relevant for AD, such
   as the basal forebrain, can be detected post mortem with histochemistry.
   Because of the small size of these structures, in vivo MR detection is
   very difficult at conventional field magnets (1.5 and 4 T). In this
   study, we observed iron deposits with histochemistry and MR microscopy
   at 11.7 T in the brain of the mouse lemur, a strepsirhine primate which
   is the only known animal model of aging presenting both senile plaques
   and neurofibrillary degeneration. We also examined a related species,
   the dwarf lemur. Iron distribution in aged animals (8 to 15 years old)
   agrees with previous findings in humans. In addition, the high iron
   levels of the globus pallidus is paralleled by a comparable contrast in
   basal forebrain cholinergic structures. Because of the enhancement of
   iron-dependent contrast with increasing field strength, microscopic
   magnetic resonance imaging of the mouse lemur appears to be an ideal
   model system for studying in vivo iron changes in the basal forebrain in
   relation to aging and neurodegeneration. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

   dental prophylaxis and provided with the control diet or experimental
   diet. At the conclusion of the test period, the animals were
   anesthetized and examined for clinical calculus independently by two
   examiners. The animals were then given another dental prophylaxis,
   provided the alternate ration, and the foregoing procedures were
   repeated. When the animals were provided the HMP-coated diet,
   significant reductions in calculus formation of 48-62\% were observed in
   the lemurs and the baboons. No clinically significant changes were
   observed in body weights or in blood chemistry values as a result of

Abstract = {DNA sequences from three mitochondrial genes and one nuclear gene were
   analyzed to determine the phylogeny of the Malagasy primate family
   Lemuridae. Whether analyzed separately or in combination, the data
   consistently indicate that Eulemur species comprise a clade that is
   sister to a Lemur catta plus Hapalemur clade. The genus Varecia is basal
   to both. Resolution of cladogenic events within Eulemur was found to be
   extremely problematic with a total of six alternative arrangements
   offered by various data sets and weighting regimes. We attempt to
   determine the best arrangement of Eulemur taxa through a variety of
   character and taxon sampling strategies. Because our study includes all
   but one Eulemur species, increased taxon sampling is probably not an
   option for enhancing phylogenetic accuracy. We find, however, that the
   combined genetic data set is more robust to changes in taxon sample
   than, are any of the individual data sets, suggesting that increased
   character sampling stabilizes phylogenetic resolution. Nonetheless, due
   to the difficult nature of the problem, we may have to accept certain
   aspects of Eulemur interrelationships as uncertain. (C) 1999 The Willi

Abstract = {The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is a small, nocturnal primate
   endemic to Madagascar and has evolved specific activity patterns to
   survive the dry season, a period of low food availability and low
   ambient temperatures. These patterns are sex-specific. I determined
   seasonal fluctuations of body mass and tail circumference in M. murinus
   under natural conditions in a dry deciduous forest of western Madagascar
   in 1994-1995. I compared those variables among individuals during
   different activity patterns. Based on mark-recapture and monitoring of
   sleeping sites, 73.1\% of adult females but only 18.9\% of adult males
   remained inactive for the several weeks to 4-5 months throughout the
   cool dry season. Inactive females stored fat before the onset of the
   inactive phase and lost 31.7\% of their mass during the dry winter, but
   inactive males hardly stored fat, and their body mass did not change
   between onset and end of the period of inactivity. Duration of
   inactivity was significantly longer for females than males, due to
   earlier emergence of males. At the end of inactivity and activity
   periods, respectively, body masses and tail circumferences did not
   differ between inactive and active males and females. Thus, M. murinus
   has evolved two different strategies to survive the cool dry season:
   being generally active but combined with daily torpor of <24 h, and
   remaining inactive for days to several weeks, which might be associated
   with prolonged bouts of torpor.},

Abstract = {The conventional notion is that small-bodied primates should be highly
   insectivorous in order to obtain protein and other nutrients from a food
   source that is more easily digestible than plant matter. I studied
   feeding behavior of Microcebus rufus for IG months in the east coast
   rainforest of Ranomafana National Park. I determined the diet primarily
   through analysis of 334 fecal samples from live-trapped individuals,
   They consumed a mixed diet basically of fruit and insects year-round. I
   identified 24 fruits, while 40-52 remain unidentified. Bakerella, a
   high-lipid epiphytic semiparasitic plant, was in 58\% of fecal samples
   that contained fruit seeds, and was consumed year-round irrespective of
   general resource availability? It served both as a staple and keystone
   resource. Fruit was less frequently totally absent from fecal samples of
   individual mouse lemurs than insect matter was. For Microcebus rufus,
   fruit,may be a primary source of energy: not just complementary to
   insects. Fruit consumption increased in quantity and diversity during
   the latter part of the rainy season and the very Early part of the dry
   season, when fruit production was relatively high. This pattern in fruit
   feeding is similar to that for mouse lemurs in the west coast dry
   forests and is related to specific nutritional needs dictated by the
   highly seasonal character of the life cycle. Coleoptera were present in
   67\% of samples examined a,ld were consumed year-round by the subjects,
   but insect consumption did not increase during the rainy season when
   insect abundance was highest.},

Title = {Natural disasters and primate populations: The effects of a 2-year

Abstract = {We examine demographic patterns from a long-term study (1987-1996) of
   the population of ring-tailed lemurs in the Beza-Mahafaly Special
   Reserve, in southwestern Madagascar In particular we focus on the
   effects that a severe drought in 1991 and 1992 had on the population.
   The population of adult animals peaked in 1991 but decreased rapidly
   during the subsequent drought and immediate postdrought years. In the
   1992 birth season (and second year of the drought) infant mortality
   reached 80\%, and 20.8\% of all adult females in the reserve died. The
   following year adult female mortality reached a high of 29.9\%. Juvenile
   mortality in 3 intensively studied groups was 57\% during the second
   year of the drought. We compare these data with infant, juvenile, and
   adult female mortality in non-drought years. We are not able to
   calculate adult male mortality, as they often emigrate from the reserve
   to the adjacent forest; however in the same 3 intensively studied
   groups, 89\% of the males disappeared during the 2 immediate postdrought
   years. By 1996 the population had begun to recover after the decline
   that correlated with the drought conditions. Annual reproduction, high
   birth rates (.80-.86 annually), early sexual maturity and dietary
   adaptability may be contributing factors to the recovery. Effects of and
   recovery from this type of natural disaster in the Beza Mahafaly
   ring-tailed lemur population parallel responses of some species of
   macaques and baboons with respect to the adaptability of edge species.},

   with parentally raised and hand-reared infants, with the fostered twins
   growing at rates intermediate between those found under the two other

Title = {Cathemerality in the mongoose lemur, Eulemur mongoz},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {47},
Number = {4},
Pages = {279-298},
Abstract = {Results of a 10 month study of the mongoose lemur (Eulemur mongoz) at
   Anjamena are presented. The activity pattern is documented in detail for
   both wet and dry seasons based on observations conducted over the entire
   24 h period. E, mongoz was found to be cathemeral throughout the year
   but exhibited shifts towards more diurnal activity in the wet season and
   more nocturnal activity in the dry season. The cathemeral activity
   pattern in the mongoose lemur appears to be coordinated with sunrise,
   sunset, and day length and modulated by an inhibitory effect of low
   nocturnal light intensity in the forest during the wet season, resulting
   in mainly diurnal activity. Temperature and rainfall may also influence
   the activity pattern. Few advantages to food-related behavior appear to
   derive from this activity pattern, although resource accessibility may
   be enhanced by nocturnal behavior in the dry season, leading to
   reduction in interspecific competition, Cathemerality may also represent
   a behavioral thermoregulatory mechanism allowing the mongoose lemur to
   conserve energy by being active during the cool nights of the dry
   season. In addition, nocturnal behavior in the dry season probably
   allows avoidance of predation by raptors at the time of year when least
   protection is afforded by vegetation. Am. J, Primatol, 47:279-298, 1999.

Abstract = {Energetic benefits provided by sharing a nest were investigated by
   measuring resting metabolic rate in the lesser mouse lemur (Microcebus
   murinus), a nocturnal solitary primate that usually groups in a nest
   during its diurnal rest. Resting metabolic rate was measured on 32
   individuals maintained either alone or grouped with one, two, or three
   conspecifics originating from the same social group. In this seasonal
   breeder, individual resting metabolic rate varied significantly from
   1.08 +/- 0.03 to 1.47 +/- 0.05 (SE) ml O-2 h(-1) g(-1) for nonbreeding
   and breeding seasons, respectively. During the breeding season, both
   sexes reduced their energetic expenditure by 20\% when grouped in pairs,
   and maximal energetic benefit (40\%) was achieved when three animals
   nested together. During the nonbreeding season, maximal energetic gain
   was observed when as few as two animals nested together because resting
   metabolic rate was already decreased. Finally, when three or four
   animals shared the same nest, resting metabolic rate was minimal,
   independent of sex and season, at 0.88 mi O-2 h(-1) g(-1), suggesting
   that nest-sharing in this solitary primate is an important strategy to
   minimize energetic costs to cope with seasonal shortage of food.},

Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {43},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate reproductive strategies and
   their consequences in gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), small
   solitary nocturnal primates endemic to Madagascar. Previous reports of
   sexual dimorphism in favor of males and females, respectively, a high
   potential for sperm competition and pheromonal suppression of mating
   activity among captive males, led us to investigate mechanisms of
   intrasexual competition in a wild population. Based on 3 years of
   mark-recapture data, we demonstrate that sexual dimorphism in this
   species fluctuated annually as a result of independent changes in male
   and female body mass. Male body mass increased significantly prior to
   the short annual mating season. Because their testes increased by 100\%
   in the same period and because their canines are not larger than those
   of females, we suggest that large male size may be advantageous in
   searching for estrous females and in enabling them to sustain periods of
   short-term torpor. In contrast to reports from captive colonies, we
   found no evidence for two morphologically distinct classes of males.
   Finally, we also show that most adult males are active throughout the
   cool dry season that precedes the mating season, whereas most adult
   females hibernate for several months. This is in contrast to other
   solitary hibernating mammals, where males typically emerge 1-2 weeks
   before females. Thus, this first extended field study of M. murinus
   clarified previous conflicting reports on sexual dimorphism and male
   reproductive strategies in this primitive primate by showing that their
   apparent deviation from predictions of sexual selection theory is
   brought about by specific environmental conditions which result in
   sex-specific life history tactics not previously described for mammals.
   A general conclusion is that sexual selection can operate more strongly
   on males without resulting in sexual dimorphism because of independent
   selection on the same traits in females.},

Title = {Molar morphology and variation in two Malagasy lemur families (Lemuridae

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {The lemurs of Madagascar represent a radiation of primates exhibiting
   considerable ecological and morphological diversity. Dentally, all
   lemurs possess the characteristic strepsirhine anterior tooth comb, but
   exhibit variation in their postcanine teeth that may be related to
   dietary differences. In this study, I examine two factors that could
   complicate a strictly functional interpretation of tooth form variation
   in two families of Malagasy primates, the Lemuridae and Indriidae. (1)
   Allometry may be responsible for observed variation. Body size, not
   specific tooth features, may be the object of selection; tooth features
   may vary among taxa as a consequence of differences in body size. (2)
   Taxonomic affiliation may ``explain{''} variation without recourse to
   functional explanations. Tooth morphology among closely-related taxa may
   be constrained developmentally or as a result of stabilizing selection.
   Morphological variation between families, therefore, may not be the
   result of current functional differences related to physical dietary
   properties, but may result from past events that are lineage-specific.
   Morphological features from the upper and lower second molars of seven
   lemurid and four indriid taxa are compared. The results of this study
   indicate that the majority of second molar features scale isometrically.
   Initial separation by families is warranted by the homogeneous slopes
   but different elevations in analyses of covariance between families.
   Intrafamilial variation is considerable for lemurids, but more discrete
   among indriids. Functional explanations for tooth form variability
   should take into consideration the degree of variation within taxa. For
   this particular dataset, the two families should be analyzed separately,
   and, because of the considerable overlap of subspecies with full species
   among lemurids, the lowest taxonomic unit recognized should be used. (C)

Abstract = {The goals of this study were to investigate the transmission and
   possible functions of chemical signals in intragroup communication among
   ring-tailed lemurs, Lemur catta. In particular, I examined the effects
   of sex on these processes because sexual selection theory predicts
   specific functions for chemical signals. I recorded all interactions
   with 214 scent marks of 11 male and 9 female ring-tailed lemurs during
   the first 10 min following their deposition. I found that 62\% of these
   scent marks were investigated with a median latency of 30 s and that
   89\% of investigated scents were also counter-marked by the receiver.
   The type of focal scent mark (male or female anogenital and male
   antebrachial mark) had a significant effect on both the timing and type
   of response. Males investigated and counter-marked female scents more
   often than vice versa, but significant second-order transitions
   suggested that the behavior of an animal was not only influenced by the
   immediately preceding scent mark and that a scent;is not completely
   masked by a counter-mark. There was no evidence for an audience effect,
   and only social rank of female senders had an effect on receivers.
   Variation in the response of receivers across reproductive seasons as a
   function of senders' sex indicated that female scents may function in
   mate attraction and competition among females, whereas male scents may
   be primarily used in intrasexual competition. Three main conclusions
   emerged. First, the exchange of olfactory signals within groups was
   highly structured and surprisingly efficient. Second, olfactory signals
   may constitute general mesasages whose transfer is partly controlled by
   the receiver. Finally, sexual selection theory provides a useful
   theoretical framework for functional examinations of mammalian olfactory
   communication.},

Volume = {106},

Abstract = {Biomechanical explanations are fundamental to studies of functional
   dental morphology. Until recently foods were not classified in
   mechanical categories amenable to a rigorous examination of the
   fundamental physical relationship between teeth and foods. Fruit, insect
   and leaf categories, although descriptive, are mechanically
   heterogeneous. The diets of five Malagasy lemur taxa were described in
   terms of two mechanical properties, hardness and sheer strength in an
   earlier study (Yamashita, 1996b). In the present study, correlations
   between these two physical food properties and second molar tooth
   features of two lemur families are examined. Several relationships are
   hypothesized: 1) crest length is expected to be positively correlated
   with food shear strength; 2) the radius of curvature (r) of cusps is
   expected to be positively correlated with food hardness; and 3) basin
   area should Increase relative to cusp radius as food hardness increases,
   and cusp-to-basin ratios should decrease with increasing food hardness.
   Two additional hypotheses address the debate concerning the relative
   influences of the most frequently eaten foods versus the most stressful
   foods in determining tooth form. The results of the predicted
   relationships are equivocal. 1) Crest length is negatively instead of
   positively correlated with strong foods. Crest lengths are correlated
   with quantities of leaf consumption, which are related to leaf shape
   more than to material composition. 2) As expected, r is positively
   correlated with food hardness and negatively with shear strength, but
   this applies to upper molar cusps only. Lower molar cusps complicate
   simple generalizations of relationships. 3) Hard foods are correlated
   with a tight fit of occluding cusps and basins instead of the expected
   loose fit. The mast stressful foods eaten (hardest and strongest) have
   higher correlations with tooth features than the most frequently eaten
   foods. Several functional complexes can be identified. Hard food items
   are correlated with short cusps in lemurids, tight occlusal fit, small
   trigon and large talonid areas, and deep, acute basins. Large, shallow
   trigons, shallow, unrestricted talonids, and large upper molar basins
   are indicative of a diet of strong foods. These results demonstrate that
   some variation in tooth features is explicable with reference to
   mechanical properties of diet, although the relationships are complex.

Abstract = {Free-ranging Old World primates released on St. Catherine's Island,
   Georgia (USA), were tested for infection with Trypanosoma cruzi as part
   of a study of the epizootiology of sylvatic T. cruzi in the southeastern
   USA. The parasite was observed in liver infusion tryptose medium
   cultures of blood from seven of 11 lion-tailed macaques (Macaca silenus)
   and one of 19 ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). Cultures of blood from
   10 black and white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata) were all negative.
   Analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNA gene polymorphisms detected
   using polymerase chain reaction techniques indicates that the parasites
   isolated from both the lion-tailed macaques and the ring-tailed lemur
   are probably the same as T. cruzi parasites isolated from raccoons
   (Procyon lotor) trapped on St. Catherine's Island and other locations in
   the southeastern USA. Foraging lion-tailed macaques were observed to
   handle and partially consume specimens of Triatoma sanguisuga, the
   triatomine bug thought to be a vector of T. cruzi in the southeastern
   USA. Oral transmission of the parasite may have occurred as a result of
   this behavior.},

   variable and was lowest between March and June, coinciding with a dearth
   of ripe fruit. The proportion of night-time spent feeding exceeded the
   proportion of daytime spent feeding during August, September, October
   and December. The group fed more frequently in the undercanopy during
   the day and the canopy during the night. The ratio of time spent feeding
   to time spent travelling was significantly smaller during the day
   compared to the night. These differences can be best explained by the
   group preferring to feed in the undercanopy during the day and the

Abstract = {4.7 Tesla T2-weighted magnetic resonance images showed a highly
   significant signal decrease in the pallidum, substantia nigra, putamen,
   and a less significant decrease in the thalamus and the caudate of aging
   mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). We evaluated the contribution of iron
   deposits to the signal decrease comparing Perls' stained histological
   sections of six mouse lemurs brains aged 1 to 10 years to magnetic
   resonance images. In young animals, none of the brain structures was
   stained. A large number of iron deposits were visible in the pallidum
   and substantia nigra of aged animals and a moderate number in the middle
   aged ones. In the putamen, few iron deposits were visible in aged and
   middle-aged animals. The thalamus and the caudate appeared unstained
   with Perls' technique: iron was too low to be detected. The
   intensification of the reaction by diaminobenzidine revealed iron
   deposits in the thalamus of aging animals. This study suggests that in
   mouse lemurs, iron deposits are responsible for T2-weighted signal
   decrease in the central gray nuclei. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Abstract = {First perfected on humans, and then on animals, techniques of genetic
   analysis from DNA have been great improved over the last twenty years.
   Unlike proteins, DNA is present and directly accessible in most of cells
   : it is stable and sufficiently variable to constitute a very good
   individual genetic marker. Compared with the classical analysis of
   restriction fragments (RFLP), DNA amplification currently allows a rapid
   genetic analysis from very small amounts of DNA. The random amplication
   of DNA (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA : RAPD) produces series of DNA
   fragments which are anonymous and polymorphic, thus representing good
   individual genetic markers.
   Applied to the study of the genetic structure of different lemur
   colonies, the RAPD method revealed some advantages and disadvantages of
   a universal but random amplification of the genome. We conducted various
   studies on an individual scale and then at a group level, in two species
   of lemurs (Microcebus murinus and Eulemur macaco macaco). We used RAPDs
   as a tool for the genetic control of captive breeding management,
   through qualitative and quantitative measurement of the genetic
   diversity of a group. With these markers, we can now monitor variations
   in the genetic diversity according to different parameters in
   association with the management of captive breeding.},

Abstract = {Many communities with a common biogeographic history show a non-random
   pattern of species composition. When occupying similar habitats,
   communities with fewer species tend to represent nested subsets of
   communities with more species. Nestedness can come about by successive
   extinction of species from communities derived from a common species
   pool, or when species from the original species pool have different
   colonization abilities. In the first case extinction depends on site
   characteristics, but is independent of geographical location, In the
   second case, communities at sites close to the original species pool
   have more species in common with the original species pool than do more
   distant communities, The communities of evergreen rain forest lemur
   species in eastern Madagascar show a highly nested pattern, but there is
   no distance effect of species similarity among communities. This finding
   is consistent with the idea of a common species pool for the whole of
   eastern Madagascar, with selective extinction during fragmentation of
   forest during the Pleistocene. In contrast, the communities of dry
   deciduous forest lemur species in western Madagascar show a strong
   distance effect of species similarities, but show nested patterns only
   when the dataset is subdivided into northern and southern community
   subsets. This indicates a common pool of dry forest species which
   originated around Toliara and from there spread towards the north and
   the south.},

   equivalent to the nondescript bird species dismissed by ornithologists

   relatively little attention from primatologists. Yet they are diverse,
   widely distributed, and fill a variety of ecological roles. We review
   what is known of these lemurs, and conclude that small but significant
   behavioral differences exist among them, particularly in the way in
   which they partition available resources. Because they exhibit both
   sympatric and allopatric distributions, these primates provide an ideal
   model for investigating the influences of ecological role vs. phylogeny

   against various parts of the PrP. Strong PrP labelling was observed in
   the epithelial cells lining the pharyngeal and gastrointestinal lumen.
   The tonsils and the walls of the lymph and blood vessels below the
   intestinal epithelium were also labelled. There were no such
   immunoreactions in healthy lemurians killed as controls, i.e. a younger
   congener of the same species housed under the same conditions, and other
   belonging to the smaller species Microebus murinus, reared in the
   laboratory and never fed on commercial food products containing cattle
   meat. These results demonstrate a strong PrP accumulation in the brain,
   the gastrointestinal tract and underlying lymphoreticular structures in
   these primates living in a zoological park and suffering from a
   spongiform encephalopathy.},

Abstract = {Several examples have been documented of novel behaviours which have
   apparently arisen spontaneously in primate groups and then spread
   through the group by learning. Here we describe the first recorded
   instance of such an acquired behaviour in a prosimian. The behaviour,
   consisting of immersing the tail in water and then drinking from the wet
   tail, was observed in a group of semi free-ranging ring-tailed lemurs
   (Lemur catta). Seventeen of 28 animals showed the behaviour, including
   adult males. Several animals which did not show the behaviour were
   observed watching and sometimes sharing the wet tail of animals who did.
   Several incomplete sequences, notably of non-stimulus directed elements,
   were also seen in non-performers. It is likely that stimulus enhancement
   is the mechanism of spread of this behaviour through the group, although
   the presence of the incomplete sequences suggests that imitation is also
   a possibility.},

Abstract = {Previous histological and behavioral studies of aging mouse lemurs have
   demonstrated changes similar to those observed in elderly humans and in
   patients with Alzheimer's disease. We explored 18 animals of ages 6
   months to 9 years. Axial T2-weighted images of the brain were performed
   on a 4.7 Tesla Bruker Biospec 47/30 system. We estimated cerebral
   atrophy by adding measures of high signal areas characteristic of
   cerebrospinal fluid (interlobular and sylvian fissures, lateral and
   third ventricles) of four contiguous cortical slices. We observed a
   significant increase of cerebral atrophy with aging and one case of an
   apathetic 8-year-old animal presenting a considerably higher cerebral
   atrophy. We also observed high correlations between decreased signal
   intensities and age for the pallidum, the substantia nigra, and the
   putamen. These results suggest that aging mouse lemurs present similar
   magnetic resonance images of cerebral alterations to those encountered
   in aging humans and that high-field T2-weighted magnetic resonance
   images can help in the early detection, in vivo, of animals suspected of
   pathological aging. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Abstract = {In the extant lemur communities of Madagascar the number of lemur
   species increases with increasing number of tree species. In forests
   with few tree species lemurs use patches with higher number of tree
   species than average. However, in forest plots with high number of tree
   species, lemurs stay in places with lower number of tree species than
   average. At low tree species diversity a minimum number of different
   tree species seems to be required within the animals' home range to
   assure year-round food availability. At high tree species diversity tree
   species essential for survival might be `'diluted'' by resources which
   are of no use for lemurs, thus increasing energetic expenses for
   traveling between suitable patches. According to the present analyses,
   structural diversity is of subordinate importance to the number of tree
   species as a correlate of lemur species richness.
   Within limits of disturbance intensity and on a small geographic scale,
   disturbances increase forest productivity. Lemurs reach higher species
   numbers and population densities in slightly disturbed areas compared
   with undisturbed sites. This peaked curve of the number of lemur species
   over disturbance, however, may not only be a consequence of `'resource
   dilution'' in undisturbed sites and higher food abundance in slightly
   disturbed areas, but also a consequence of selective extinction of lemur
   species which were unable to cope with the disturbance regime
   exaggerated by human interference over the last few hundred or thousand
   years.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have revealed the presence of tau protein-immunoreactive
   accumulations and beta amyloid protein (A beta) deposits in the cerebral
   cortex of the aged mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus. To examine the
   age-related evolution of these changes and compare their regional
   distribution to that reported for humans and nonhuman primates with
   Alzheimer's disease lesions, we performed a quantitative analysis of a
   large series of mouse lemurs aged from 1 to 13 years. The prevalence and
   density of tau protein-immunoreactive accumulations in the neocortex of
   this prosimian increased steadily with age. Neocortical areas were
   frequently affected even in young mouse lemurs, whereas the subiculum
   and entorhinal cortex were only involved occasionally in animals older
   than 8 years. As in anthropoid primates, diffuse A beta deposits were
   often observed in the cerebral cortex and amygdala of old mouse lemurs.
   Although all animals with diffuse A beta deposits had tau
   protein-immunoreactive accumulations in the neocortex, no correlation
   was found between the densities of these lesions in each area and among
   the areas studied. The age-dependent progression of tau
   protein-immunoreactive accumulations indicates that this prosimian may
   represent a valuable model for the study of the biochemical mechanisms
   of brain aging, while the relative sparing of hippocampus in mouse
   lemurs contrasts sharply with previous reports on neurofibrillary tangle
   formation in humans, and suggests that this animal may also be useful to
   investigate the biological characteristics of neuroprotection in this
   area. Furthermore, the present data indicate that A beta deposition in
   mouse lemurs is not age dependent, but occurs in a few vulnerable old
   animals.},

Volume = {103},

Abstract = {Affiliative relations between adult males and immature group members
   were studied in three naturally occurring groups of ringtailed lemurs
   (Lemur catta) over a 12-month period at Beza-Mahafaly Reserve,
   southwestern Madagascar. No statistically significant difference was
   found in rates of affiliative interactions between adult males and older
   immatures (juveniles and adolescents) over reproductive seasons.
   However, some of the adult males in two focal groups increased their
   rates of affiliative behaviors with older immatures during the lactation
   and subsequent 1993 postmigration periods. Female involvement with
   infants during lactation season, the increasing independence of
   juveniles and adolescents, and length of male tenure may be factors
   contributing to such a pattern. Neither adult males nor immatures were
   significantly responsible for the initiation and maintenance of
   proximity in male-immature dyadic interactions. Neither dominance rank
   nor age-class of the adult male affected their rates of affiliative
   behavior with immatures. The majority of focal males exhibited an
   interest in infants and occasionally participated in alloparental care.
   It is suggested that adult males can benefit from affiliative relations
   with immatures in terms of opportunities for greater spatial centrality
   in the group, which can lead to enhanced predator protection and greater
   opportunities to develop affiliative relationships with females.
   Immatures can benefit from affiliation with males in relation to
   enhanced predator detection and protection, alloparental care, and
   opportunities to develop social skills. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {We observed two free-ranging troops of ring-tailed lemurs at the Berenty
   Reserve Madagascar. Kinship affinities in these troops are known only
   for mothers and their offspring 14 years of age. We attempted to
   quantify social relationships. Almost all agonistic interactions were
   dyadic, and triadic agonistic interactions, such as alliances, were very
   rare. Dominance hierarchies in both sexes in the two troops were not
   linear. As in cercopithecine monkeys, mothers were dominant over their
   adult daughters. However, the daughters were nor ranked immediately
   below their mothers. Close proximity and social grooming occurred more
   frequently between closely related females, such as mother-daughter and
   sister-sister dyads, than between unrelated females. Frequent-proximity
   relations also occurred between adult males that had emigrated from
   another troop and entered the present troop together, even though they
   did not rank closely to one another. Subordinates were likely to groom
   and to greet dominants more frequently than vice versa. During group
   encounters, particular females were involved in agonistic interactions
   with animals of other troops, regardless of dominance rank Adult males,
   regardless of their dominance rank, but not adult females, constantly
   tried to drive solitary males away.},

Abstract = {The mongoose lemur Eulemur mongoz is a prosimian primate native to
   Madagascar. Populations also occur on the islands of Anjouan and Moheli
   in the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comores. The current status of
   the lemur is unknown, but thought to be declining due to habitat
   destruction. The author carried out a short survey by interviewing
   people in 22 villages on Anjouan, in order to gauge the attitude of
   local people to the presence of these animals. The results of the survey
   strongly indicated that mongoose lemurs are routinely caught and kept as
   pets by local children. However, there was no compelling evidence for
   other forms of persecution.},

Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Intermale affiliative behavior was studied in three groups of naturally
   occurring ringtailed lemurs over a one-year period. The adult males in
   the sample exhibited affiliative behavior with all other males in their
   social groups; but affiliative behavior between some male-male dyads
   occurred markedly more often than between others. These dyads are called
   `'preferred partnerships.'' The formation of preferred partnerships did
   not appear to be influenced by male dominance rank or age-class.
   Furthermore, these partnerships were of a short-term nature, and none
   persisted throughout the entire study period. The following factors may
   explain the absence of rank or age effects, and the brevity of preferred
   partnerships: (1) frequent fluctuation in the male dominance hierarchy
   in each study group; (2) the fact that higher-ranking males may not
   offer specific benefits to lower-ranking males; and (3) the fact that
   male dispersal affected the male membership of each group over the
   12-month study period. The focal males engaged in significantly more
   affiliative behavior during the lactation period compared with the other
   reproductive seasons. Migration partners may offer each other predator
   protection during the transfer process, and although males that transfer
   together do not engage in alliance or coalition behavior towards
   resident males, males transferring in pairs or threesomes are in a
   better position to spot and defend themselves against attack by resident
   males. Migration partners also provide social contact for each other
   while in the process of immigration.},

Title = {The nature and frequency of agonism in free-ranging and

Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Agonistic behaviour was studied in three groups each of free-ranging and
   semi-free-ranging brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus) at Berenty, Madagascar
   and the Duke University Primate Center (DUPC) respectively. The purpose
   of the study was to answer questions arising from the work of other
   researchers regarding the frequency and intensity of agonism in this
   species. Authors of field studies generally concluded that agonism was
   rare and mild, whereas those who had studied semi-free-ranging or
   captive animals at the DUPC reported intense agonism during the peaks of
   the mating and birth seasons, with sometimes fatal wounding occurring
   among captive animals.
   I recorded 30 agonistic behaviours or `'signals'' which I grouped into
   seven general categories cuffs, other physical contact, threats, chases,
   third party intervention, unprovoked submissive signals, and reciprocal
   aggression. The seven categories represent the types of signals which
   initiated or otherwise defined agonistic interactions, regardless of
   whether or not there was a submissive response to aggression. The
   relative percentages of all agonism constituted by the seven categories
   were not found to be significantly different between study sites.
   Agonistic signals were also classified as either subtle or obvious, a
   classification which crosscut the seven categories. At both study sites,
   the majority of agonistic signals initiating or defining interactions
   were subtle.
   Rates of agonism for the Berenty groups, studied during the birth season
   only, were significantly lower than those for the DUPC groups during the
   birth season, possibly due to (1) easier observation conditions at the
   DUPC, and (2) the impossibility of successful emigration at the DUPC,
   which might have resulted in social stresses translating into higher
   rates of agonism. In only one DUPC group was there significant variation
   in rates of agonism between seasons.
   I found agonistic behaviour to be mild, at both study sites, in the
   senses of subtlety of both aggressive and submissive signals,
   unlikelihood of response to aggression, and virtual absence of wounding;
   and I noted that serious wounding during other studies at the DUPC
   involved animals captive in caged runs. Comparing rates of the study
   groups with rates reported in other research for brown lemurs, other
   lemuriform species, and some New and Old World anthropoid species, I
   concluded that E. fulvus agonism was in fact not rare except in
   comparison to baboons and macaques.},

Abstract = {Male primates have evolved particular displays to advertise male
   fitness. In nocturnal prosimians it was assumed that such displays
   (vocal advertisement, marking behaviour) are hormonally dependent and
   influenced by olfactory cues of a receptive female. To test this
   assumption mouse lemur males of different gonadal status (males
   castrated as adults, normal males), or of varying olfactory input (males
   vomeronasalectomized or bulbectomized as adults) were paired with intact
   `'stimulus'' preoestrous females and vocalization, vocal rates, and
   marking behaviours were monitored. The vocal rate of only one particular
   vocalization, the `'trill'' advertisement call, was sexually dimorphic
   and changed depending on gonadal status. Vocalization rate declined
   significantly in sexually experienced, castrated males, as did their
   marking behaviour. There was, however, no significant correlation
   between either calling rate or marking behaviour and plasma testosterone
   levels in gonadally intact males. Neither vomeronasalectomy nor
   bulbectomy had a significant effect on trill calling rate or marking
   behaviour. Results imply that testicular hormones have a greater impact
   on advertisement calling and marking motivation than olfactory
   information of preoestrous females. In contrast to rodents, ultrasonic
   calling rate seems to be not only dependent on gonadal status, but also
   on social experience.},

   impose a continuous reinforcement to a strong antipredator response. I
   question such an interpretation and instead suggest that extant birds of

   might not have been necessarily true for the extinct eagle. In addition,

Abstract = {Relationships between tooth morphology and physical food properties are
   well established Because food breakdown is initiated by the dentition,
   one may posit that variations in tooth form are related functionally to
   the physical demands placed on them by the diet. Yet classification of
   diets as leaves, fruits, and insects does not adequately describe foods
   in mechanically significant ways. Furthermore, physical dietary
   properties have not been well quantified. I describe patterns of two
   physical food properties-hardness and shear strength-in the diets of
   five lemur taxa in Madagascar-Propithecus diadema edwardsi, Lemur fulvus
   rufus, and Lemur rubriventer-in the rain forest site of Ranomafana
   National Park and Propithecus v. verreauxi and Lemur catta at the dry
   forest site of Beta Mahafaly special reserve. I compared mean plant
   values for each lemur taxon, the most stressful foods eaten and the
   amount of time spent feeding on each dietary item. Variation in food
   hardness is a site phenomenon with fluctuations within sites. Shear
   strength is strongly seasonal. Lemur diets, as traditionally classified,
   are not mechanically uniform since frugivores and folivores could be
   separated on the basis of the physical properties of their foods.
   Finally, I assign taxa to dietary categories that are mechanically
   descriptive and derive several predictions regarding expected tooth
   morphologies from them.},

Title = {Convergence in community structure and dietary adaptation in Australian
   possums and gliders and Malagasy lemurs},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-46},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The possums and gliders of Australia and the lemurs of Madagascar are
   ideally suited for investigation of radiation and convergence in
   arboreal mammal communities because of their long history of independent
   radiation in similar biophysical environments. Possum and glider
   communities at 22 sites in Australia and lemur communities at 18 sites
   in Madagascar were compared to evaluate patterns of community and
   species convergence in two shared habitats (evergreen and deciduous
   monsoon rainforests) and three derived habitats (Australian eucalypt
   forests and heaths, and Malagasy thorn scrubs). Arboreal mammals were
   classified into five dietary guilds for comparison of community
   structure and species adaptation. There is little evidence of
   convergence in trophic structure at the community level, but strong
   evidence of convergence in dietary adaptation at the species and niche
   level. Malagasy rainforest communities were characterized by a higher
   proportion of frugivore-folivores, and Australian rainforest and moist
   eucalypt communities by a higher proportion of folivores and
   folivore-frugivores. Possum and glider communities in temperate eucalypt
   forests and heaths supported a higher proportion of nectarivores and
   exudivores. Overall species richness was significantly higher in
   Madagascar. Four hypotheses are erected to account for these
   differences. The relative scarcity of frugivores in Australian evergreen
   rainforests is accounted for by the predominance of bird-dispersed
   fruits, and fruiting phenologies unsuitable for mammal exploitation and
   dispersal. Higher folivore diversity in Australian evergreen rainforests
   is associated with a more pronounced seasonal shortage of edible fruits
   and new leaf, which has increased dependence on mature leaf. Folivore
   species richness is greatest in Australian moist eucalypt forests where
   structural complexity, sustained by seral responses to wildfire, permits
   a high level of vertical segregation. Increased nectarivory and
   exudivory in Australian temperate eucalypt forests and heaths is
   associated with Mediterranean winter rainfall regimes, which permit year
   round exudate production, and not with the absence of nectar feeding
   bats as previously supposed. A lower overall species richness in
   Australian rainforests is attributed to a longer history of contraction
   and fragmentation by anthropogenic fires (monsoon rainforests) and
   Pleistocene climatic change (tropical evergreen rainforests). A high
   degree of convergence is apparent between genera occupying folivore and
   wood gouging niches, in terms of gastrointestinal morphology (e.g.
   Pseudocheirus-Lepilemur) and dental morphology (e.g.
   Dactylopsila-Daubentonia). Divergences are most apparent in adaptations
   associated with frugivory, including larger body size, diurnality, and
   bipedal suspension and leaping modes of locomotion (in Eulemur spp.).
   This study highlights the importance of founding effects, competition
   from other vertebrate taxa, coevolution between animals and their food
   plants, and differences in biophysical environments, as determinants of
   mammalian radiation and convergence.},

Abstract = {Research into the diet of Alaotran gentle lemurs Hapalemur griseus
   alaotrensis provided an opportunity to collect blood samples from
   apparently healthy adults, allowing a preliminary database of normal
   brood biochemistry values to be created. Six adults (one female, five
   males) were each sampled once and the range of values obtained are
   presented and compared with ranges observed in other lemur species.
   Values from one individual were excluded because the levels of
   creatinine and urea measured were markedly elevated above those observed
   in the rest of the lemurs. Raised levels of both these blood parameters
   can be used as an indication of renal failure. The animal later died,
   just 15 days after the brood sample was taken, and the cause of death
   was attributed in part to the presence of oxalate crystals in the
   kidneys. A potential source of the oxalate is discussed.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Affiliative behavior between adult male and female ringtailed lemurs was
   examined as part of a project concerning male affiliation with
   conspecifics of all age/sex classes. Males in three social groups were
   studied over a 12 month period. Male-female preferred partnerships
   existed, and were variable according to reproductive season. Dominance
   rank, age, or tenure of the male did not appear to affect either the
   number of partnerships or frequency of affiliative behaviors that males
   had with females. However, males residing in groups with fewer males
   exhibited both higher frequencies of affiliative interactions with
   females and were nearest neighbors to females more often than males
   living in a group containing more males. Females were found to be
   responsible for proximity maintenance of male-female dyads in the
   majority of cases. Neither reproductive season nor seasonal availability
   of food resources strongly affected the frequency of affiliative
   interactions between males and females. it is proposed that an important
   aspect of successful group membership for male ringtailed lemurs relates
   to the development of social relationships with adult females. Males can
   benefit from such relationships in terms of greater centrality to the
   spatial core of the group, which can result in enhanced predator
   protection, greater opportunities for social contact, and potentially
   greater access to estrous females. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   scent-marking to scent from `'strange'' animals. In the experiment where
   individual scents were presented one at a time, the length of time spent
   sniffing was greater for `'strange'' scent but this did not transfer to
   additional scent-marks. Most of the responses were elicited from males
   in the group and involved wrist-marking only, but timing of experiment
   influenced both responses and type of scent-mark probably in relation to
   the onset of oestrus. The role of scent-marking and the concept of group
   scent are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Locomotor diversity among lemurids has been ignored by placing most
   species into a category of arboreal quadrupeds. Recent held studies have
   shown that leaping behaviors comprise a relatively large amount of their
   travel. In this contribution I detail a study of captive lemurs
   locomoting on a designed support network and/or in outdoor enclosures.
   Associations between support context, leaping behaviors, and landing
   kinematics are detailed for Hapalemur griseus, Eulemur rubriventer,
   Eulemur fulvus, Eulemur mongoz, and Varecia variegata. In-air body
   position, including the amount and location of trunk flexion, coupled
   with the extent of shoulder and hip flexion dictates limb use at
   landing. Limb strike pattern when landing onto the same support type
   varies interspecifically. The kinematic variation in leaping behaviors
   may well have implications for functional analyses of the postcranium.

Journal = {DODO-JOURNAL OF THE WILDLIFE PRESERVATION TRUSTS},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {67-75},
Abstract = {Environmental enrichment is an effective method of enhancing the
   wellbeing of zoo animals. A common approach to enriching a captive
   animal's environment is to introduce feeding methods which encourage
   exploratory or manipulative behaviour and which stimulate natural
   foraging behaviours, thus keeping the animal occupied. Such feeding
   enrichment may take a variety of forms. In a study at the Jersey
   Wildlife Preservation Trust two groups of ruffed lemurs Varecia
   variegata were fed under two different conditions. Both groups shared
   their enclosures with ring-tailed lemurs Lemur catta, and interspecific
   and intraspecific aggression was known to occur over food. Food was
   scattered on/near the ground of the enclosure (baseline), or was
   suspended in hanging baskets (experimental). This regime was altered on
   a daily basis over 22 days. Behavioural observations of activity in
   between feeds and of aggression at feeding times were made. On
   experimental days, aggression between ruffed and ring-tailed Lemurs was
   significantly lower than baseline. The ruffed lemurs were also more
   active and spent more time in the trees than on baseline days.
   Explanations far these effects are suggested.},

Abstract = {This study quantifies the effects of low-intensity logging (affecting
   <10\% of the forest surface) on leaf chemistry, leaf and fruit
   production, and their effects on lemurs in a dry deciduous forest in
   western Madagascar. Logging exposed the remaining trees to more
   sunlight. Within a single tree and among trees, this resulted in higher
   protein concentrations in sun-exposed leaves, while fiber content
   remained constant. Concentrations of condensed tannins were also higher
   at higher sun exposure, but they leveled off at lower light intensities
   before protein and sugar concentrations. Within the 2-yr study period,
   crown extension due to higher availability of sunlight could compensate
   only for parts of the crown area lost due to logging. Thus, the biomass
   of leaves available was reduced, while average leaf quality (measured as
   the ratio of protein to fiber) increased.
   Fruit production was also positively correlated with sun exposure of the
   tree crown. Since fruits of the main timber trees (Commiphora spp.) are
   rarely consumed by frugivorous lemurs, removal of these trees increases
   sun exposure of other potential food trees for frugivores.
   At the described level of logging intensity, sightings of all lemur
   species increased (significantly in three out of seven species at P less
   than or equal to 0.05) compared to the pre-logging state and two control
   plots. This increase was attributed to increased fruit production and
   higher protein concentration in sun-exposed leaves.
   In natural forests, treefall gaps may have effects similar to those of
   logging in the present study. Low level disturbances, in general, may be
   important for the carrying capacity for folivorous and frugivorous
   lemurs and possibly for most primates.},

   conducted on several samples of oxyurid nematodes parasitic in
   strepsirrhine primates: Cheirogaleus major, Galago senegalensis, and
   Microcebus murinus. A diagnosis of Lemuricola contagiosus Chabaud \&
   Fetter, 1959 from C. major is given using syntypes, from which a
   lectotype is selected. The rest of the specimens were compared to L.
   contagiosus. From measurements taken from each sex, an initial Principal
   Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on log-transformed data and a
   second PCA was performed on Log-shape ratios after elimination of the
   isometric differences. The parasites collected from M. marinas, which
   can be differentiated from the closely related L. contagiosus by both
   standard morphological characters and morphometric variables, are
   described as Lemuricola microcebi n. sp. The parasites collected from
   Galago are morphologically very similar to L. microcebi n. sp. The most
   probable explanation for this resemblance is considered to be a transfer
   from Microcebus to Galago but, due to the small numbers of individuals
   in our samples, it is impossible to eliminate the possibility that the
   parasites of Galago belong to an undescribed species. Until more
   material or information can be obtained, it is proposed to refer to the
   parasites from Galago as Lemuricola sp.},

Abstract = {Systematics and evolution of Malagasy lemurs has been analyzed using
   morphological characters, fossil evidence, ecological/ethological data,
   and chromosomal banding patterns. Recent developments in DNA technology
   have provided evolutionary biologists with additional and powerful tools
   for making phylogenetic inference. In the last years several studies
   concerning highly repeated DNA sequences (hrDNA) provided new insights
   about the systematic relationships among the differ ent species of
   Lemuridae and Cheirogaleidae.
   Here, a reconstruction of molecular phylogeny of extant Malagasy lemurs
   based on the comparison of cytochrome-b mitochondrial DNA sequences is
   presented. With the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and direct
   sequencing of amplified DNA fragments, both the phylogenetic range and
   resolving power of comparative analysis can be extended. These
   techniques allow to gather sequence data useful to evaluate the pattern
   of molecular evolution offering opportunities for phylogenetic purposes.
   A 290-bp fragment of cytochrome-b gene has been amplified and sequenced
   from the following species: Tupaia glis, Galago alleni, Daubentonia
   madagascariensis, Indri indri, Variegata variegata, Eulemur fulvus,
   Eulemur coronatus, Eulemur rubriventer, Eulemur mongoz, Eulemur macaco,
   Lemur catta, and Hapalemur griseus griseus.
   The phylogenetic trees obtained show the relationships among the Eulemur
   species and confirm the karyological and hrDNA results of a separated
   clade for L. catta/Hapalemur. The separation of Varecia variegata from
   the other genus of the family Lemuridae is discussed.},

Abstract = {From mid-August to late October 1988, we surveyed Marojejy Strict Nature
   Reserve, in the northern part of Madagascar's rain forest. Although
   widely believed to be a keystone site for lemur conservation, only
   incidental information concerning Marojejy's primate communities has
   hitherto been published. The reserve extends from 75 to 2133 m in
   altitude, and its 60,150 ha comprise an almost-intact series of
   altitudinal forest zones, now fundamentally isolated from formerly
   contiguous surrounding forest. We visited all forest zones and all
   altitudes of the reserve. We observed a total of nine species including
   the little-known diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema candidus), for
   which Marojejy is the most important site. Aye-aye (Daubentonia
   madagascarensis) is also present. Brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus albifrons)
   is the most frequently observed species. Little is known about this
   subspecies in the wild. In the interior many lemurs were extremely
   inquisitive of human presence, showing how little hunted they are. This
   contrasted with their lower numbers and evasive behavior in the more
   accessible regions of the reserve. The major threats to the lemurs of
   Marojejy are the ceaseless piecemeal clearance of the reserve's forest,
   which is proceeding inward from the boundary, and direct trapping.},

   In the course of this work we uncover and correct some inaccuracies in
   past codings, and rectify an important error in the cladistic procedure
   used by Tattersall \& Schwartz (1991). According to the tail probability
   tests, it appears that Hapalemur is most likely the sister-group of
   other Lemuridae. We support as valid the genera Eulemur and Varecia. The
   status of subspecies of Eulemur remains equivocal.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-13},
Abstract = {The gross anatomy of white adipose tissue was studied in seven carcasses
   representing three lemurid species (Lemur catta, Eulemur fulvus, E.
   mongoz) to validate in vivo methods of assessing fatness, and to
   contribute to a comprehensive database on the organization of adipose
   tissue in Mammalia. During the years preceding their deaths, subjects
   had been either caged or semi-provisioned under semi-captive conditions,
   and their body masses had been recorded several times annually. All
   specimens were as fat or fatter than anthropoid primates maintained for
   long periods under comparable conditions. At least eight superficial,
   four intra-abdominal, and two intermuscular adipose depots were
   described, all of which were comparable to those described previously
   for macaques and humans. All typical mammalian depots were present. Many
   superficial depots adhered tightly to the skin and/or underlying
   muscles. The superficial `'paunch'' depot on the outer ventral wall of
   the abdomen, characteristic of anthropoid primates, was found in all
   specimens. The existence of this depot in lemurs suggests that it
   evolved early in Primates. As in monkeys and humans, the paunch was very
   variable in size, massive in obese specimens but almost absent in
   moderately lean ones, confirming that extensive accumulation and
   selective depletion of adipose tissue at this depot is a special feature
   of Primates, In some obese specimens, adipose tissue on the ventral and
   lateral thorax and on the inner dorsal wall of the abdomen, extending
   around the kidneys and into the pelvic canal, was also massive. The
   investigation allowed for improvement of protocols for external
   measurement in ongoing research on growth, mass, and fatness in
   ringtailed and redfronted lemurs. Comparisons of subjects' ranges of
   body mass change during adult life with masses of adipose tissue found
   upon dissection suggested that much of lemurs' predictable seasonal
   change in body mass is due to changes in the mass of white adipose
   tissue. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The rate of digesta passage was measured in five captive Philippine
   flying lemurs (Cynocephalus volans). These animals were force fed
   capsules containing known quantities of either particulate or soluble
   markers. The volumes of the gastrointestinal tracts of three flying
   lemurs were determined based on the wet weight of the contents of each
   section of the gut. The mean rate of digesta passage was 14.37 +/- 3.31
   h when determined using the particulate marker and 21.9 +/- 0.03 h when
   determined using the soluble marker. The values based on the particulate
   marker are between 2\% and 10\% of similar values for other arboreal
   folivores. The morphology of the gastrointestinal system of the
   Philippine flying lemur is similar to that of other hindgut fermenters.
   Flying lemurs have a simple stomach and a large caecum. The total gut
   capacity of the Philippine flying lemur is similar to that of other
   herbivores, but is slightly smaller than that of either the koala
   (Phascolarctos cinereus), a hindgut fermenter, or the three-toed sloth
   (Bradypus variegatus), a foregut fermenter. These data suggest that
   flying lemurs deal with the problems of a folivorous diet very
   differently than some other arboreal mammals. Phascolarctos cinereus and
   Bradypus variegatus may represent one extreme with Cynocephalus volans
   representing the other extreme along a continuum of foraging strategies
   that are compatible with the arboreal folivore lifestyle.},

   APPROACH},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {94},
Number = {2},
Pages = {189-202},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Studies of primate positional behavior have only occasionally employed
   statistical testing because these data sets violate the assumptions
   underlying most standard statistical tests. As currently practiced, both
   common methods of collecting data on positional behavior involve
   sequential observations of a limited number of individuals, leading to
   data sets consisting of interdependent observations. Data collected from
   sequential observations may not be as dependent as currently accepted;
   however, approaches are available to deal with such data. Some
   previously applied tests are discussed, and an alternative strategy, a
   randomization test, is demonstrated. Randomization tests are based on
   observed rather than theoretical distributions. Thus, they are robust
   when applied to data sets which do not adhere to the strict assumptions
   inherent in standard tests. Randomization procedures suggested by Manly
   ({[}1991] Randomization and Monte Carlo Methods in Biology {[}New York:
   Chapman and Hall]) and Edgington ({[}1987] Randomization Tests {[}New
   York: Marcel Dekker, Inc.]) are applied to data collected for three
   species of lemurs studied at Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar (Lemur
   fulvus, Lemur rubriventer, and Lemur variegatus). Standard chi-square
   tests indicate statistically significant differences between these
   species in nearly all aspects of locomotor, postural, and substrate use
   behavior. In contrast, the randomization tests showed a significant
   difference only in the postures used by these lemurs. Lemur variegatus
   uses hindlimb suspensory postures much more often than L. fulvus or L.
   rubriventer, and the latter species use vertical clinging more often
   than L. variegatus. The results from the randomization tests are
   considered more reliable because by using individuals rather than
   observations as the units compared, they limit the problem of
   interdependence of observations and thus provide a conservative test.
   The particular randomization tests used also explicitly test the
   proposition that individuals of a species are more similar to each other
   than to individuals of other species. The lack of significant results is
   not surprising in light of the small number of individuals studied and
   the great deal of variability within a species for most of the variables
   considered. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {A 31-year-old woman presented with a clinically otherwise unsuspicious
   area of profuse sweating on her right forearm. Without triggering
   agents, sweating attacks producing a clear, serous fluid were observed
   daily. Histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen showed
   hyperplastic eccrine glands with pale, stippled cytoplasm characteristic
   of eccrine hamartoma. No explanation, however, has been given for the
   fact that several authors observed eccrine hamartomas in the same
   anatomical location. Adolescent lemurs of the species catta (ringtailed
   lemur) are equipped with a pair of antebrachial cutaneous glands located
   on the volar sur-face of the wrist. They exude a clear secretion
   enabling them to `'brachial branch mark'' their territories.
   Histopathologic findings in the ringtailed lemur's antebrachial organ
   show characteristics of both apocrine and eccrine glands. In contrast to
   normal apocrine glands, however, the antebrachial organs of ringtailed
   lemurs reach the epidermis directly and are not connected to hair
   follicles. According to the `'biogenetic law'' of Ernst Haeckel, stating
   that ontogeny has to be seen as a short and incomplete repetition of
   phylogeny, a human fetus passes all evolutional stages from a single
   cell via amphibians and mammals to a human being. Thus, the antebrachial
   organ of the ringtailed lemur may be the `'phylogenetic explanation''
   for eccrine hamartomas of the forearm in humans. The histopathologic

Abstract = {The deposition of amyloid beta (A beta) protein in the brain has been
   demonstrated immunocytochemically in the small Lemurian primate
   Microcebus murinus. Both meningocerebral vascular deposits and cortical
   parenchymal deposits occur. All eight aged (> 8 years old) Microcebus
   examined showed vascular amyloid deposits, whereas only four exhibited
   parenchymal plaques. The vascular amyloid infiltrated the tunica media
   of the leptomeningeal and cortical arteries and arterioles and was also
   found in capillaries. A beta was observed to be deposited in three
   general forms in the cortical neuropil: round or elliptical plaques that
   were thioflavin-negative but sometimes showed a central concentration of
   A beta immunoreactivity; round plaques with a densely immunoreactive
   core that was thioflavin-positive; extensive ribbon-like infiltrations
   enclosing multiple cortical blood vessels. These observations, taken
   together with previous descriptions of age-related neurodegenerative
   changes in Microcebus, indicate that this species undergoes a
   beta-amyloid-associated neuropathology highly similar to that seen in
   Alzheimer's disease. We conclude that this lemurian primate of small
   size and relatively short life expectancy, provides a compelling animal
   model of some principal features of Alzheimer's disease.},

   maintenance of this stereotypic response is enigmatic. Bird bones
   recovered from cave surface deposits in southwestern Madagascar include
   the remains of an eagle (Aquila), a genus that has disappeared from
   Madagascar and that would have been capable of hunting animals the size
   of adult P. verreauxi and L. catta. The stereotypic response of these
   two lemurs toward raptors may have been retained from the period when
   this extinct eagle inhabited the island and is reinforced by rare acts
   of predation by extant birds of prey.},

   insect visitors, nectar-foraging lemurs trigger the pollen
   removal/receipt mechanism of its large flowers. Further evidence
   suggests that several unrelated Malagasy angiosperms have also evolved
   floral traits for lemur pollination. Lemur diets are highly variable,
   however, and the lemur-flower interactions do not reflect coevolution
   but mutualism asymmetry with evolution principally driven on the plant
   side. Lemur pollinated plants may be the only angiosperms that
   successfully have evolved to exploit primates as pollinators.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {30},

Pages = {243-256},
Abstract = {A recent examination of color vision in the ringtail lemur produced
   evidence that these prosimians could make color discriminations
   consistent with a diagnosis of trichromatic color vision. However, it
   was unclear if this behavior reflected the presence of three classes of
   cone or whether lemurs might be able to utilize signals from rods in
   conjunction with those from only two classes of cone. To resolve that
   issue, spectral sensitivity functions were obtained from ringtail lemurs
   (Lemur catta) and brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus) using a noninvasive
   electrophysiological procedure, electroretinographic flicker photometry.
   Results from experiments involving chromatic adaptation indicate that
   these lemurs routinely have only a single class of cone photopigment in
   the middle to long wavelengths (peak sensitivity of about 545 nm); they
   also have a short-wavelength-sensitive cone pigment with peak of about
   437 nm. The earlier behavioral results are suggested to have resulted
   from the ability of lemurs to jointly utilize signals from rods and
   cones. The cone pigment complements of these lemurs differ distinctly
   from those seen among the anthropoids.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1993},

Pages = {195-207},
Abstract = {Lateralized feeding behaviors of 7 wild-born and 6 captive-born
   Hapalemur griseus sp. were evaluated in two conditions, simple food
   reaching and species-typical bamboo foraging. Gentle lemurs were found
   to have the strongest lateral hand preference in simple food reaching of
   any prosimian species yet studied. However in this small sample,
   population-level lateralization was not found: 5 preferred the right
   hand and 8 the left. The movement pattern used by hapalemurs when
   feeding on bamboo leaf shoots was categorized into four components: PULL
   IN, COUNTERFORCE, TURN, and FEED IN. Lateral hand bias was scored for
   all four components and lateral mouth preference was scored for the two
   components that involved the mouth (COUNTERFORCE and FEED IN). Strong
   positive correlations were found between hand preference in the most
   lateralized components of shoot eating (TURN and FEED IN) and simple
   food reaching. This suggests that the gentle lemurs' species-typical
   bamboo feeding behavior may contribute to the exceptionally strong hand
   preference for simple food reaching seen in this species. There were
   negative correlations between the component measure of shoot feeding
   that required strength (COUNTERFORCE) and the components that required
   manipulation (TURN and FEED IN). Within the COUNTERFORCE and FEED IN
   components, mouth preference and hand preference were positively
   associated in a manner that suggested one side of the mouth was
   preferred for removing the shoot and the other side for mastication.
   Asymmetrical dental wear may provide a means of dating behavioral
   lateralization in ancestral species.},

   Subsequently, four groups containing different combinations of
   experienced individuals from the original group and naive individuals
   were tested. Solutions to the problem and access to the food were
   recorded and considered in relation to social factors. In the original
   group, two adult males learned to open the boxes, with one male
   increasingly preventing the other from approaching. In the second group,
   with the subordinate male and certain females removed, the dominant male
   tolerated successful performances by a juvenile female. Group 3
   consisted of three passive female participants from the original group
   and a naive female; one of the three original females now became the
   sole box-opener. The introduction of the subordinate male from the
   original group into the all-female group led to a sharing of box-opening
   by this subject and the skilled female. In the final group, intense
   aggression toward the skilled female by a new, naive adult male resulted
   in two previously passive females succeeding on some occasions. In
   lemurs, at least some `scroungers' appear able to learn to perform a new
   act when the social context permits.},

Abstract = {A study of ten erythrocyte enzymes (PGM I, II, III, G6PD, 6PGD, GLO I,
   ADA, Est D, DIA, AcP, CA II, and AK) performed on 89 wild and 32 captive
   Eulemur macaco macaco shows that most systems are monomorphic except
   four (GLO I, CA II, 6PGD, and NADH DIA). The polymorphism of these
   markers allows us to make a satisfactory analysis of the variability on
   this species, especially on the view of comparing, wild and captive
   populations, and shows that: (1) the population does not contain all
   phenotypes existing in the wild (CA(a), CA(a+b), DIA(IV), GLO I(B-C),
   and PGD(c) are completely absent in all captive populations and
   DIA(III+IV) is only present in three out of 32 animals; (2) in the
   Nosy-komba Island, the PGD(c) and DIA(IV) are absent and DIA(III+IV) and
   GLO I(B-C) are only present in 1 out of 46 analyzed samples, showing
   that this population constitutes an isolate. The possibility to use
   these data for a strategy of Lemur conservation is discussed.},

Abstract = {The influence of social status, reproductive and agonistic contexts and

   in captive groups of Lemur fulvus and Lemur macaco. No evidence of

   fulvus, intrasexual relationships were characterized by the dominance of
   one adult male over another and by the existence of female affiliative
   association ('central' vs. `peripheral' females). In L. macaco, no
   intrasexual dominance relationships were apparent except for a brief
   ostracism of one female. In both species, (1) intrasexual differences in
   social status were related to differences in marking rates, (2) no
   direct relation appeared between marking rates and aggression or
   reproduction, (3) allomarking was not differentially directed towards
   specific individuals and (4) physical environmental factors clearly
   influenced scent-marking and allomarking rates. These results are
   discussed in relation to the possible functions of marking behaviour in

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {58},

Pages = {72-83},
Abstract = {Alloparental care was examined in three free-ranging groups of Lemur
   catta. Group members of all age/sex classes were found to participate to
   varying degrees in alloparental care of infants, and some types of care
   were performed significantly more frequently by animals of particular
   age/sex classes. Adult males, previously reported not to interact with
   infants, were found to groom and play with them occasionally. Rank or
   sex of the infant did not affect the amount of alloparental care it
   received. It is suggested that individuals of all age/sex classes can
   benefit from receiving or performing alloparental care. Infants can
   develop social skills and receive protection from alloparents; mothers
   gain free time to forage and rest; prereproductive females can learn
   parental skills; all adult females and prereproductive animals are
   aiding kin by alloparental care, and adult males, by interacting with
   infants, may have the opportunity to establish a relationship with the
   mother which could enhance future reproductive success.},

Title = {ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF SEXUAL FUNCTION IN THE MALE
   LESSER MOUSE LEMUR (MICROCEBUS-MURINUS)},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-25},
Abstract = {Environmental factors that regulate the sexual activity of male lesser
   mouse lemurs have been studied experimentally with more than 60 captive
   animals over an 8-year period. In this nocturnal Malagasy prosimian,
   variation in day length is the primary factor controlling seasonal
   sexual activity. Plasma testosterone concentrations were low (= 9 ng/ml)
   during short days and reached 60 ng/ml during long days (> 12-hour day).
   This cyclic pattern persists unchanged when artificial photoperiodic
   rhythms are applied and is not altered by ageing. The timing of puberty
   is also regulated by photoperiodic changes. Nevertheless, the sexual
   activity of the male lesser mouse lemur can be dramatically modified by
   the social environment. In heterosexual groups, behavioural and
   physiological components of sexual activity are depressed in all males
   except the dominant one, whose aggressive interactions are always
   successful. Intermale sexual inhibition was shown to be mediated by
   chemical cues present in the urine of dominant or isolated males but not
   in urine of subordinate individuals. The inhibitory signals possess
   lipophilic properties and are not contingent on the gonadal activity of
   the urine donor but are linked to adrenocortical activity. By contrast,
   chemical signals stimulating the reproductive function of all males are
   found in the urine of females, the presence of which is required for the
   establishment of clear dominance among grouped males. Endocrine
   mechanisms underlying intermale sexual inhibition by chemical cues were
   analysed. Variations in prolactin strongly suggest that olfaction
   interacts with the photoperiodic regulation of reproductive function,
   leading to changes in the sensitivity of the negative feedback effect of
   testosterone on gonadotrophin secretion. Inhibitory or stimulatory
   effects of chemical signals are discussed in the context of their
   functional significance for wild populations.},

   of this putative discrimination.  Two semi-captive groups of ringtails
   served as study subjects:  one group had many years of experience living
   in the forest, whereas the other group had relatively little such
   experience.  Responses to play-backs suggested that both groups used the
   same acoustic criteria to discriminate ``calls of large hawks{''} from
   other sounds, but the range of auditory stimuli that evoked antiraptor
   responses was broader for the experienced group than for the
   inexperienced group.  Although several interpretations of the

Abstract = {An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), was adapted to detect

   It was used to define the prevalence of infection and the immunogenicity
   of an Al(OH)3 bacterin in a population of laboratory born A. l.
   lemurinus monkeys.  This represents a preliminary step to reduce K.
   pneumoniae produced mortality.  A striking finding during a
   cross-sectional prevalence study was that none of the babies of less
   than 2 months old had detectable levels of antibody.  The antibody
   prevalence gradually increased in all other age groups reaching 87.5\%
   in the 8-10-month-old group.  These results indicate that infection with
   K. pneumoniae occurred sometime between 2 and 6 months of age, probably
   as a result of oral-faecal contamination and a change in the feeding and
   grooming behaviour.  To determine whether infants had maternal
   antibodies or if they were asymptomatic carriers of the bacterium, a
   cross-sectional study was done in 15 infants less than 4 months old and
   their mothers.  K. pneumonia antibodies were detected in 11/15 mothers
   with serum titers ranging from 1:4 to > 1:256 and the bacterium was
   isolated from 3 babies and one mother and her baby.  Results showed that
   no maternal antibodies remained in babies older than 3 weeks old.  A
   prospective study indicated a reduction in mortality from 20\% for the
   previous 3 years to 3.7\% (3/79) in AL(OH)3 K. pneumoniae bacterin

   Reexamination of variations in pelage color and pattern, size and body

   We identify and name 2 new subspecies in western Madagascar, and 1 in

Abstract = {In 1987, a long-term study of the demography of Lemur catta was begun in
   southern Madagascar.  Eighty-five ringtailed lemurs were captured,
   marked, and released.  Adult age classes were estimated using patterns
   of dental attrition.  Including young, 155 individuals from nine groups
   were identified and monitored over 18 months.  The study population of
   the reserve remained stable, with a growth rate of 0.98.  Group sizes
   ranged from nine to 22 individuals (mean 14).  Home ranges were larger
   (32 ha) and population densities lower (135/km2) than those for
   previously studied populations, and there was a relationship between
   habitat quality (e.g., no. of large trees) and these factors.  At the
   beginning of the study, there were more adult males than females, but
   the sex ratio reached 1.00 by the last census.  Females first gave birth
   at 3 years of age, and 80\% or more of the females gave birth in 2
   consecutive years.  Fifty-two percent of the infants dies in the first
   year and, given preliminary findings, only 40\% of those born reach
   adulthood.  Age-specific fertility patterns were similar to those
   reported for anthropoid primates.  Forty-seven percent of the adult
   males migrated or were missing within a year.  This included 78\% of the
   3-4 year olds and 38\% of older age classes.  No females were observed
   to migrate.  One group split during the study.  Demographic patterns are
   discussed and related to patterns in other populations of ringtailed
   lemurs as well as in anthropoids.},

Abstract = {The gut microbiome is gaining recognition for its role in primate
   nutrition, but we stand to benefit from microbiome comparisons across
   diverse hosts and environmental conditions. We compared gut microbiome
   structure in four lemur species from four phylogenetic lineages,
   including 9 individual mouse lemurs (Microcebus danfossi), 6 brown
   lemurs (Eulemur fulvus), 20 sifakas (Propithecus coquereli), and a
   single sportive lemur (Lepilemur grewcockorum). In northwestern
   Madagascar, these species are sympatric, but use different feeding
   strategies to cope with environmental challenges, including relying on
   tree gums and insects (mouse lemurs), and some vs. significant leaf
   matter (brown lemurs vs. sifakas and sportive lemurs). From one fecal
   sample collected per lemur in the dry season in the Anjajavy Forest, we
   determined gut microbiome diversity, variability, and membership via 16S
   rRNA sequencing. The lemurs harbored strongly species-specific gut
   microbiomes. Brown lemurs showed more diverse and generalized consortia;
   mouse lemurs, sifakas, and the sportive lemur had less diverse consortia
   with more distinct memberships. Consistent with their fallback foods,
   mouse lemur microbiomes included taxa putatively associated with gum and
   insect digestion, whereas those of sifakas and the sportive lemur showed
   stronger and distinct signatures of leaf fiber and secondary compound
   metabolism. These results point to feeding strategy, intertwined with
   host phylogeny, as a driver of gut microbiome composition, but highlight
   real-time dietary specificity as a contributing driver of microbiome
   diversity. While illuminating how gut microbiomes facilitate host
   nutrition on challenging foods, these results help explain how
   ecologically diverse primates living in sympatry may differentially cope
   with seasonal or stochastic lean times.},

Abstract = {Mouse lemurs (Microcebus) are a radiation of morphologically cryptic
   primates distributed throughout Madagascar for which the number of
   recognized species has exploded in the past two decades. This taxonomic
   revision has prompted understandable concern that there has been
   substantial oversplitting in the mouse lemur clade. Here, we
   investigatemouse lemur diversity in a region in northeastern Madagascar
   with high levels of microendemism and predicted habitat loss. We
   analyzed RADseq data with multispecies coalescent (MSC) species
   delimitation methods for two pairs of sister lineages that include three
   named species and an undescribed lineage previously identified to have
   divergent mtDNA. Marked differences in effective population sizes,
   levels of gene flow, patterns of isolation-by-distance, and species
   delimitation results were found among the two pairs of lineages. Whereas
   all tests support the recognition of the presently undescribed lineage
   as a separate species, the species-level distinction of two previously
   described species, M. mittermeieri and M. lehilahytsara is not
   supported-a result that is particularly striking when using the
   genealogical discordance index (gdi). Nonsister lineages occur
   sympatrically in two of the localities sampled for this study, despite
   an estimated divergence time of less than 1 Ma. This suggests rapid
   evolution of reproductive isolation in the focal lineages and in the
   mouse lemur clade generally. The divergence time estimates reported here
   are based on the MSC calibrated with pedigree-based mutation rates and
   are considerably more recent than previously published fossil-calibrated
   relaxed-clock estimates. We discuss the possible explanations for this
   discrepancy, noting that there are theoretical justifications for
   preferring the MSC estimates in this case.},

Abstract = {Delimitation of cryptic species is increasingly based on genetic
   analyses but the integration of distributional, morphological,
   behavioral, and ecological data offers unique complementary insights
   into species diversification. We surveyed communities of nocturnal mouse
   lemurs (Microcebusspp.) in five different sites of northeastern
   Madagascar, measuring a variety of morphological parameters and
   assessing reproductive states for 123 individuals belonging to five
   different lineages. We documented two different non-sister lineages
   occurring in sympatry in two areas. In both cases, sympatric species
   pairs consisted of a locally restricted (M. macarthuriiorM. sp. \#3) and
   a more widespread lineage (M. mittermeieriorM. lehilahytsara). Estimated
   Extents of Occurrence (EOO) of these lineages differed remarkably with
   560 and 1,500 km(2)versus 9,250 and 50,700 km(2), respectively.
   Morphometric analyses distinguished unambiguously between sympatric
   species and detected more subtle but significant differences among
   sister lineages. Tail length and body size were most informative in this
   regard. Reproductive schedules were highly variable among lineages, most
   likely impacted by phylogenetic relatedness and environmental variables.
   While sympatric species pairs differed in their reproductive timing (M.
   sp. \#3/M. lehilahytsaraandM. macarthurii/M. mittermeieri), warmer
   lowland rainforests were associated with a less seasonal reproductive
   schedule forM. mittermeieriandM. lehilahytsaracompared with populations
   occurring in montane forests. Distributional, morphological, and
   ecological data gathered in this study support the results of genomic
   species delimitation analyses conducted in a companion study, which
   identified one lineage,M. sp. \#3, as meriting formal description as a
   new species. Consequently, a formal species description is included.
   Worryingly, our data also show that geographically restricted
   populations ofM. sp. \#3 and its sister species (M. macarthurii) are at
   high risk of local and perhaps permanent extinction from both
   deforestation and habitat fragmentation.},

Title = {Conservation genomic analysis reveals ancient introgression and

Abstract = {Madagascar's biodiversity is notoriously threatened by deforestation and
   climate change. Many of these organisms are rare, cryptic, and severely
   threatened, making population-level sampling unrealistic. Such is the
   case with Madagascar's dwarf lemurs (genus Cheirogaleus), the only
   obligate hibernating primate. We here apply comparative genomic
   approaches to generate the first genome-wide estimates of genetic
   diversity within dwarf lemurs. We generate a reference genome for the
   fat-tailed dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus medius, and use this resource to
   facilitate analyses of high-coverage (similar to 30x) genome sequences
   for wild-caught individuals representing species: C. sp. cf. medius, C.
   major, C. crossleyi, and C. sibreei. This study represents the largest
   contribution to date of novel genomic resources for Madagascar's lemurs.
   We find concordant phylogenetic relationships among the four lineages of
   Cheirogaleus across most of the genome, and yet detect a number of
   discordant genomic regions consistent with ancient admixture. We
   hypothesized that these regions could have resulted from adaptive
   introgression related to hibernation, indeed finding that genes
   associated with hibernation are present, though most significantly, that
   gene ontology categories relating to transcription are over-represented.
   We estimate levels of heterozygosity and find particularly low levels in
   an individual sampled from an isolated population of C. medius that we
   refer to as C. sp. cf. medius. Results are consistent with a recent
   decline in effective population size, which is evident across species.
   Our study highlights the power of comparative genomic analysis for
   identifying species and populations of conservation concern, as well as
   for illuminating possible mechanisms of adaptive phenotypic evolution.},

Title = {The importance of scale in comparative microbiome research: New insights
   from the gut and glands of captive and wild lemurs},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {81},
Number = {10-11, SI},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Research on animal microbiomes is increasingly aimed at determining the
   evolutionary and ecological factors that govern host-microbiome
   dynamics, which are invariably intertwined and potentially synergistic.
   We present three empirical studies related to this topic, each of which
   relies on the diversity of Malagasy lemurs (representing a total of 19
   species) and the comparative approach applied across scales of analysis.
   In Study 1, we compare gut microbial membership across 14 species in the
   wild to test the relative importance of host phylogeny and feeding
   strategy in mediating microbiome structure. Whereas host phylogeny
   strongly predicted community composition, the same feeding strategies
   shared by distant relatives did not produce convergent microbial
   consortia, but rather shaped microbiomes in host lineage-specific ways,
   particularly in folivores. In Study 2, we compare 14 species of wild and
   captive folivores, frugivores, and omnivores, to highlight the
   importance of captive populations for advancing gut microbiome research.
   We show that the perturbational effect of captivity is mediated by host
   feeding strategy and can be mitigated, in part, by modified animal
   management. In Study 3, we examine various scent-gland microbiomes
   across three species in the wild or captivity and show them to vary by
   host species, sex, body site, and a proxy of social status. These rare
   data provide support for the bacterial fermentation hypothesis in
   olfactory signal production and implicate steroid hormones as mediators
   of microbial community structure. We conclude by discussing the role of
   scale in comparative microbial studies, the links between feeding
   strategy and host-microbiome coadaptation, the underappreciated benefits
   of captive populations for advancing conservation research, and the need
   to consider the entirety of an animal's microbiota. Ultimately, these
   studies will help move the field from exploratory to hypothesis-driven
   research.},

Title = {A national survey of household pet lemur ownership in Madagascar},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 8},
Abstract = {Primates are extracted from the wild for the pet trade across the world.
   In Madagascar, lemurs are kept as illegal pets and an understanding of
   lemur pet ownership at the national level is lacking. In 2013 and 2016,
   we undertook a national survey in 11 of Madagascar's 22 administrative
   regions (n = 28 towns) with 1,709 households. To our knowledge, this is
   the first national survey of the household ownership of pet primates in
   a country where they are endemic. In the 1.5 years prior to being
   surveyed, 8\% +/- 4\% (towns as replicates) of respondents had seen a
   captive lemur while a further 0.7\% +/- 0.5\% of respondents had owned
   one personally. We estimate that 33,428 +/- 24,846 lemurs were kept in
   Malagasy households in the six months prior to our survey efforts, with
   18,462 +/- 12,963 of these pet lemurs estimated in urban household
   alone. Rates of lemur ownership did not differ by province but increased
   with the human population of a town and with the popularity of the town
   on Flickr (a proxy indicator for tourism). We found that the visibility
   of pet lemur ownership did not differ across the country, but it did
   increase with the size of the town and popularity with tourists. Areas
   with visible pet lemurs were not always the areas with the highest rates
   of pet lemur ownership, highlighting that many pet lemurs are hidden
   from the general public. Our study highlights the need for conservation
   programs to consider both the proportion of inhabitants that own pet
   lemurs and the total number of lemurs that are potentially being kept as
   pets in those towns. We close by noting that for some species, even just
   a small amount of localized live extraction for pet ownership could be
   enough to cause localized population extinctions over time. Moreover, an
   urgent response is needed to combat a recent and alarming rise in
   illegal exploitation of biodiversity across Madagascar.},

Title = {A viral video and pet lemurs on Twitter},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 9},
Abstract = {Content shared on social media platforms can impact public perceptions
   of wildlife. These perceptions, which are in part shaped by context
   (e.g. non-naturalistic setting, presence of a human), can influence
   people's desires to interact with or acquire wild animals as pets.
   However, few studies have examined whether this holds true for wild
   animals featured in viral videos. This study reports on opportunistic
   data collected on Twitter before, during, and after a video that
   featured a habituated ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), called
   ``Sefo{''}, in southern Madagascar went `viral' (i.e. circulated rapidly
   on the internet). Our dataset of 13,953 tweets (from an 18.5-week time
   period in early 2016) referencing lemurs was collected using targeted
   keywords on the Twitonomy Service. We identified 613 individual tweets
   about people wanting a lemur as a pet. In addition, 744 tweets that were
   captured in our dataset linked to the Sefo viral video. We found that as
   the number of tweets about the viral video increased, so did the number
   of tweets where an individual wanted to have a lemur as a pet. Most
   tweets (91\%) did not make reference to a specific species of lemur, but
   when they did, they often (82\%) referenced ring-tailed lemurs (L.
   catta), ruffed lemurs (Varecia spp.), and mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   spp.). This study serves as a case study to consider how viral content
   can impact how wild animals are perceived. We close by noting that
   social media sites like Twitter, which are increasingly providing their
   users with news and information, should carefully consider how
   information about wild animals is shared on their platforms, as it may
   impact animal welfare.},

Title = {Mix it and fix it: functions of composite olfactory signals in
   ring-tailed lemurs},
Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Animals communicating via scent often deposit composite signals that
   incorporate odorants from multiple sources; however, the function of
   mixing chemical signals remains understudied. We tested both a
   `multiple-messages' and a `fixative' hypothesis of composite olfactory
   signalling, which, respectively, posit that mixing scents functions to
   increase information content or prolong signal longevity. Our
   subjects-adult, male ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)-have a complex
   scent-marking repertoire, involving volatile antebrachial (A)
   secretions, deposited pure or after being mixed with a squalene-rich
   paste exuded from brachial (B) glands. Using behavioural bioassays, we
   examined recipient responses to odorants collected from conspecific
   strangers. We concurrently presented pure A, pure B and mixed A + B
   secretions, in fresh or decayed conditions. Lemurs preferentially
   responded to mixed over pure secretions, their interest increasing and
   shifting over time, from sniffing and countermarking fresh mixtures, to
   licking and countermarking decayed mixtures. Substituting synthetic
   squalene (S)-a well-known fixative-for B secretions did not replicate
   prior results: B secretions, which contain additional chemicals that
   probably encode salient information, were preferred over pure S. Whereas
   support for the `multiple-messages' hypothesis underscores the unique
   contribution from each of an animal's various secretions, support for
   the `fixative' hypothesis highlights the synergistic benefits of
   composite signals.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Zoonotic diseases are a looming threat to global populations, and nearly
   75\% of emerging infectious diseases can spread among wildlife, domestic
   animals and humans. A `One World, One Health' perspective offers us an
   ideal framework for understanding and potentially mitigating the spread
   of zoonoses, and the island of Madagascar serves as a natural laboratory
   for conducting these studies. Rapid habitat degradation and climate
   change on the island are contributing to more frequent contact among
   humans, livestock and wildlife, increasing the potential for pathogen
   spillover events. Given Madagascar's long geographical isolation,
   coupled with recent and repeated introduction of agricultural and
   invasive species, it is likely that a number of circulating pathogens
   remain uncharacterized in lemur populations. Thus, it is imperative that
   new approaches be implemented for de novo pathogen discovery. To this
   end, we used non-targeted deep sequencing of blood transcriptomes from
   two species of critically endangered wild lemurs (Indri indri and
   Propithecus diadema) to characterize blood-borne pathogens. Our results
   show several undescribed vector-borne parasites circulating within
   lemurs, some of which may cause disease in wildlife, livestock and
   humans. We anticipate that advanced methods for de novo identification
   of unknown pathogens will have broad utility for characterizing other
   complex disease transmission systems.},

Abstract = {The acoustic structure of primate loud calls can be used as a powerful,
   inexpensive, and noninvasive tool for intra-and interspecific
   comparative analyses, reconstruction of phylogeny, and primate surveys.
   Despite the range of possibilities offered by acoustic analysis, only
   few studies so far have focused on quantitative descriptions of the
   acoustic structure of primate loud call repertoires. Here we aimed to
   assess the vocal repertoire of the solitary Sahamalaza sportive lemur,
   Lepilemur sahamalazensis, and to investigate potential communication
   functions. We recorded every sportive lemur vocalization we heard during
   1000 h of nocturnal observations of eight collared individuals, as well
   as opportunistic searches in the Ankarafa Forest, Sahamalaza Peninsula
   in northwest Madagascar. In addition, we used playback experiments with
   four call types to clarify call function. We measured both temporal and
   spectral properties to describe calls quantitatively and used
   cross-validated discriminant function analysis to validate call types
   that we identified from a preliminary qualitative inspection of the
   spectrograms of 107 calls. We identified six distinct loud call types
   with the possibility of a seventh call type, with six loud call types
   similar to those of Lepilemur edwardsi and two loud call types similar
   to those of four other sportive lemur species. The described call types
   most likely function in mate advertisement, offspring care, and
   territorial defense. Future studies of loud calling of the Sahamalaza
   sportive lemur are needed to clarify if certain call types are sex
   specific and if loud calls could be used for recognition of individuals
   to enable noninvasive density measurements and species monitoring.},

Abstract = {Studies suggest that haplorhine primates are sensitive to what others
   can see and hear. Using two experimental designs, we tested the
   hypothesis that ring-tailed lemurs (N = 16) are also sensitive to the
   visual and auditory perception of others. In the first task, we used a
   go/no-go design that required lemurs to exploit only auditory
   information. In the second task, we used a forced-choice design where
   lemurs competed against a human who would prevent them from obtaining
   food if their approaches were detected. Subjects were given the choice
   of obtaining food silently or noisily when the competitor's back was
   turned. They were also given the choice to obtain food when the
   competitor could either see them or not. Here, we replicate the findings
   of previous studies indicating that ring-tailed lemurs are sensitive to
   whether they can be seen; however, we found no evidence that subjects
   are sensitive to whether others can hear them. Our findings suggest that
   ring-tailed lemurs converge with haplorhine primates only in their
   sensitivity to the visual information of others. The results emphasize
   the importance of investigating social cognition across sensory domains
   in order to elucidate the cognitive mechanisms that underlie apparently
   complex social behavior. These findings also suggest that the social
   dynamics of haplorhine groups impose greater cognitive demands than
   lemur groups, despite similarities in total group size.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC DATA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {1},
Abstract = {Since its establishment in 1966, the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) has
   accumulated detailed records for nearly 4,200 individuals from over 40
   strepsirrhine primate taxa-the lemurs, lorises, and galagos. Here we
   present verified data for 3,627 individuals of 27 taxa in the form of a
   life history table containing summarized species values for variables
   relating to ancestry, reproduction, longevity, and body mass, as well as
   the two raw data files containing direct and calculated variables from
   which this summary table is built. Large sample sizes, longitudinal data
   that in many cases span an animal's entire life, exact dates of events,
   and large numbers of individuals from closely related yet biologically
   diverse primate taxa make these datasets unique. This single source for
   verified raw data and systematically compiled species values,
   particularly in combination with the availability of associated
   biological samples and the current live colony for research, will
   support future studies from an enormous spectrum of disciplines.},

Abstract = {Sleeping sites may be beneficial for animals in terms of
   thermoregulation, proximity to foraging sites, and protection from
   predators and infectious diseases. The abundance of adequate sleeping
   sites is thus essential for the survival of primates. We investigated
   microhabitats around sleeping sites, and the influence of habitat
   degradation on sleeping site choice and usage, in the nocturnal
   Sahamalaza sportive lemur, Lepilemur sahamalazensis. We used quarter
   point sampling (N = 315) to describe five forest fragments and 57
   sleeping sites and continuous focal animal sampling (N = 45) to
   determine the diurnal activity budget, to determine whether individuals
   inhabiting different fragments or sleeping site types showed different
   levels of vigilance. Our results suggest that tall trees with large
   crowns, a high density of small trees, and dense canopy are particularly
   important for sleeping site choice. Microhabitat structure around
   sleeping sites did not differ between forest fragments or sleeping site
   types. Diameter at breast height, crown diameter, canopy cover, and bole
   height were similar for all sleeping trees, as were the number of lianas
   in trees with tree-tangle sleeping sites, and the volume of tree holes.
   Tree holes used as sleeping sites were most often found in dead trees of
   Bridelia pervilleana (50-62.5 \%), whereas tree tangle sites were most
   often located in Sorindeia madagascariensis (20-62.5 \%). Lemurs were
   active 5-14 \% of the daytime, although they never left their sleeping
   sites or fed. Individuals occupying tree holes had higher levels of
   activity than those in tree tangles, and those in more degraded
   fragments were more active. Our results suggest that Sahamalaza sportive
   lemurs choose their sleeping sites according to specific habitat
   characteristics, and that factors associated with old and intact forest
   are likely to be crucial for their survival.},

Abstract = {Morris Goodman was a revolutionary. Together with a mere handful of
   like-minded scientists, Morris established himself as a leader in the
   molecular phylogenetic revolution of the 1960s. The effects of this
   revolution are most evident in this journal, which he founded in 1992.
   Happily for lemur biologists, one of Morris Goodman's primary interests
   was in reconstructing the phylogeny of the primates, including the
   tooth-combed Lorisifomes of Africa and Asia, and the Lemuriformes of
   Madagascar (collectively referred to as the suborder Strepsirrhini).
   This paper traces the development of molecular phylogenetic and
   evolutionary genetic trends and methods over the 50-year expanse of
   Morris Goodman's career, particularly as they apply to our understanding
   of lemuriform phylogeny, biogeography, and biology. Notably, this
   perspective reveals that the lemuriform genome is sufficiently rich in
   phylogenetic signal such that the very earliest molecular phylogenetic
   studies many of which were conducted by Goodman himself have been
   validated by contemporary studies that have exploited advanced
   computational methods applied to phylogenomic scale data; studies that
   were beyond imagining in the earliest days of phylogeny reconstruction.
   Nonetheless, the frontier still beckons. New technologies for gathering
   and analyzing genomic data will allow investigators to build upon what
   can now be considered a nearly-known phylogeny of the Lemuriformes in
   order to ask innovative questions about the evolutionary mechanisms that
   generate and maintain the extraordinary breadth and depth of biological
   diversity within this remarkable clade of primates. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {An understanding of recruitment is important for estimating population
   growth and viability, and their implications for conservation. We
   present the first results regarding the life history, maternal behavior
   and infant development of the critically endangered blue-eyed black
   lemur (Eulemur flavifrons) of Madagascar. The species breeds seasonally,
   with births occurring at the end of the dry season, between late August
   and October. Over two successive birth seasons in 2006 and 2007, we
   observed a total of 13 lactating females and 22 infants from six groups.
   We inferred age at first reproduction as 3 years, and calculated the
   birth rate as 1.0 infant per female per year with a mean inter-birth
   interval of 358 +/- 24.81 days (319-410 days). Infants spent the first 3
   weeks of life constantly with their mothers; locomotor independence and
   ingestion of solid food began at week 10, and the infants were weaned by
   week 25. After week 28, infants spent less than 20\% of their time in
   contact with their mothers. Over the study period infant mortality was
   22.7\%, with predation and sickness observed as causes. Our results
   suggest that overall recruitment is relatively slow, which has
   implications for the species' survival, particularly given their
   restricted and threatened habitat. Am. J. Primatol. 73: 474-484, 2011.

Title = {Integrating the female masculinization and challenge hypotheses: Female
   dominance, male deference, and seasonal hormone fluctuations in adult
   blue-eyed black lemurs (Eulemur flavifrons){*}},
Journal = {HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {139},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the decades since female social dominance was first described in
   strepsirrhine primates, researchers have sought to uncover the proximate
   and ultimate explanations for its development. In the females of various
   female dominant species, androgens have been implicated as regulators of
   behavior and/or predictors of seasonal fluctuations in aggression (the
   `Female Masculinization Hypothesis'). Males, more generally, respond to
   changing social demands via seasonal fluctuations in androgen-mediated
   behavior (the `Challenge Hypothesis'), that may also entail changes in
   activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Here, we explore
   if androgens, glucocorticoids, and intersexual behavior fluctuate
   seasonally in the female-dominant, blue-eyed black lemur (Eulemur
   flavifrons), with potential consequences for understanding female
   aggression and male deference. Across two studies conducted during the
   breeding and nonbreeding seasons, we assessed rates of mixed-sex, dyadic
   social behavior (aggression and affiliation) and concentrations of fecal
   glucocorticoid metabolites (Study 1) and serum sex hormones
   (androstenedione, testosterone, and estradiol; Study 2). Our results
   align with several predictions inspired by the Female Masculinization
   and Challenge Hypotheses for intersexual relations: During the breeding
   season, specifically, both aggression and androstenedione peaked in
   females, while female initiated affiliation decreased, potentially to
   facilitate female resource access and reproductive control. By
   comparison, all target hormones (androgens, estrogen, and
   glucocorticoids) peaked in males, with glucocorticoid concentrations
   potentially increasing in response to the surge in female aggression,
   and unusually high estrogen concentrations year-round potentially
   facilitating male deference via male-initiated affiliation. These
   results suggest complex, seasonally and hormonally mediated behavior in
   Eulemur flavifrons.},

Title = {Living in tiny fragments: a glimpse at the ecology of Goodman's mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus lehilahytsara) in the relic forest of Ankafobe,
   Central Highlands, Madagascar},

Abstract = {Habitat fragmentation is one of the major types of anthropogenic change,
   though fragmented landscapes predate human intervention. At present, the
   Central Highlands of Madagascar are covered by extensive grasslands
   interspersed with small discrete forest patches of unknown antiquity.
   Ankafobe, an actively protected site, comprises two such fragments of 12
   and 30 ha, respectively, known to harbor three lemur species and other
   endemic wildlife. At this location, we conducted a survey of resident
   Goodman's mouse lemurs, Microcebus lehilahytsara, to determine baseline
   behavioral and ecological conditions for this isolated population. By
   studying primates in forest fragments, investigators can characterize
   the effects of shrinking habitats and decreasing connectivity on species
   diversity and survival, thus providing a glimpse into the potential
   resilience of species in the face of anthropogenic disturbance.
   Investigating the behavioral ecology of Goodman's mouse lemurs across
   their geographic range could help us understand their metabolic and
   ecological flexibility and predict species long-term survival prospects.
   We conducted night transect walks, using capture techniques and
   telemetry, to track eight radio-collared individuals. Preliminary
   density estimates based on a limited number of sightings (n = 18) were
   2.19 ind/ha, and home range assessments ranged between 0.22 and 3.67 ha.
   Mouse lemurs traveled an average of 425 m nightly during the 5-h
   tracking periods and primarily fed on fruits of the mistletoe Bakerella
   clavata. The finding that Goodman's mouse lemurs apparently thrive in
   the seasonally cold and arid forest fragments in the Central Highlands
   indicates that they may be among the most tolerant and adaptable lemur
   species in Madagascar. These results point towards an exciting research
   program that focuses on ecological tolerance as a mechanism for
   long-term species survival.},

Title = {Myological variation in the forearm anatomy of Callitrichidae and
   Lemuridae},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANATOMY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {239},
Number = {3},
Pages = {669-681},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The anatomy of the primate forearm is frequently investigated in terms
   of locomotor mode, substrate use, and manual dexterity. Such studies
   typically rely upon broad, interspecific samples for which one or two
   representative taxa are used to characterize the anatomy of their genus
   or family. To interpret variation between distantly related taxa,
   however, it is necessary to contextualize these differences by
   quantifying variation at lower hierarchical levels, that is, more
   fine-grained representation within specific genera or families. In this
   study, we present a focused evaluation of the variation in muscle
   organization, integration, and architecture within two speciose primate
   families: the Callitrichidae and Lemuridae. We demonstrate that, within
   each lineage, several muscle functional groups exhibit substantial
   variation in muscle organization. Most notably, the digital extensors
   appear highly variable (particularly among callitrichids), with many
   unique configurations represented. In terms of architectural variables,
   both families are more conservative, with the exception of the genus
   Callimico-for which an increase is observed in forearm muscle mass and
   strength. We suggest this reflects the increased use of vertical
   climbing and trunk-to-trunk leaping within this genus relative to the
   more typically fine-branch substrate use of the other callitrichids.
   Overall, these data emphasize the underappreciated variation in forearm
   myology and suggest that overly generalized typification of a taxon's
   anatomy may conceal significant intraspecific and intrageneric variation
   therein. Thus, considerations of adaptation within the forearm
   musculature should endeavor to consider the full range of anatomical
   variation when making comparisons between multiple taxa within an
   evolutionary context.},

Abstract = {Temperature, rainfall, and resource availability may vary greatly within
   a single year in primate habitats. Many primate species show behavioral
   and physiological adaptations to this environmental seasonality,
   including changes to their diets and activity. Sahamalaza sportive
   lemurs (Lepilemur sahamalaza) inhabit the northwest of Madagascar and
   have been studied only during the dry, colder period of the year. We
   investigated potential effects of climate seasonality on this species by
   collecting behavioral data between October 2015 and August 2016,
   encompassing both the warmer wet and the colder dry seasons. We
   collected 773.15hours of behavioral data on 14 individual sportive
   lemurs to investigate year-round activity budgets, ranging behavior, and
   sleeping site locations. Additionally we recorded temperature and
   rainfall data at our study site to describe the environmental conditions
   during the study period. The study individuals significantly decreased
   their time spent traveling and increased their time spent resting in the
   dry season compared to the wet season. Although home range size and path
   lengths did not differ over the study period, sleeping locations were
   significantly different between seasons as the lemurs focused on more
   confined areas in colder periods. Overall, the results indicate that
   Sahamalaza sportive lemur behavior varies with season, in line with
   reports for other primates.},

Title = {Lemurs in a dying forest: Factors influencing lemur diversity and
   distribution in forest remnants of north-eastern Madagascar},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {228},
Pages = {17-26},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A majority of Madagascar's iconic lemurs (Primates, Strepsirrhini) is
   threatened with extinction due to anthropogenic activities like land use
   change (deforestation) and bushmeat hunting.
   We used a multivariate approach combining land cover mapping,
   vegetation/degradation monitoring, the degree of anthropogenic
   disturbance and the status of forest protection by the local community
   to model their impact on lemur diversity, population densities and
   encounter rates within a rural area of lowland rain forest in
   north-eastern Madagascar.
   High mean annual deforestation rates (2.4\%) were calculated since 1990,
   resulting in a landscape of small and isolated forest fragments. A
   limited number of eight lemur species belonging to five lemur families
   were encountered. Diurnal species were absent, while cathemeral lemurs
   avoided human disturbance. Small and nocturnal species were relatively
   abundant. Overall lemur diversity was best explained by forest size and
   a combination of disturbance and hunting. Encounter rates of three
   nocturnal taxa were influenced by forest size and habitat degradation.
   Community-level forest protection had no effect on lemur diversity, but
   coincided with lower levels of habitat degradation. Lemur population
   sizes were relatively small and only few forests remain that offer
   suitable habitats for viable populations.
   We highly recommend external conservation NGOs to support local forest
   management by improving the existing community-based approach. Actions
   should include expansion of protected habitats to increase population
   connectivity (reforestation) and to decrease lemur disturbance by
   villagers. Without external support, the last remaining forest habitats
   will be devastated within a few years resulting in the local extinction
   of most lemur populations.},

Title = {Fossil lemurs from Egypt and Kenya suggest an African origin for
   Madagascar's aye-aye},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {In 1967 G.G. Simpson described three partial mandibles from early
   Miocene deposits in Kenya that he interpreted as belonging to a new
   strepsirrhine primate, Propotto. This interpretation was quickly
   challenged, with the assertion that Propotto was not a primate, but
   rather a pteropodid fruit bat. The latter interpretation has not been
   questioned for almost half a century. Here we re-evaluate the affinities
   of Propotto, drawing upon diverse lines of evidence to establish that
   this strange mammal is a strepsirrhine primate as originally suggested
   by Simpson. Moreover, our phylogenetic analyses support the recognition
   of Propotto, together with late Eocene Plesiopithecus from Egypt, as
   African stem chiromyiform lemurs that are exclusively related to the
   extant aye-aye (Daubentonia) from Madagascar. Our results challenge the
   long-held view that all lemurs are descended from a single ancient
   colonization of Madagascar, and present an intriguing alternative
   scenario in which two lemur lineages dispersed from Africa to Madagascar
   independently, possibly during the later Cenozoic.},

Abstract = {The small-bodied mouse lemurs of Madagascar (Microcebus) are capable of
   heterothermy (i.e., torpor or hibernation). The expression of these
   energy-saving strategies has been physiologically demonstrated in three
   species: M. berthae, the pygmy mouse lemur (daily torpor), M. murinus,
   the gray mouse lemur (daily torpor and hibernation), and M. griseorufus,
   the reddish-gray mouse lemur (daily, prolonged torpor and hibernation).
   Additional evidence, based on radiotracking and seasonal body mass
   changes, indicated that mouse lemur capabilities for heterothermy
   extended to M. lehilahytsara, the Goodman's mouse lemur. In this study,
   we confirm the use of hibernation in Goodman's mouse lemurs at a new
   location, a high-plateau forest fragment in Ankafobe, central
   Madagascar. Our evidence is based on sleeping site monitoring of
   radiocollared individuals and the retrieval of three mouse lemurs from
   inside a tree hole, all of which displayed a lethargic state. Though our
   data are preliminary and scant, we show that hibernation occurs in
   high-plateau mouse lemurs, and suggest that a buffered environment
   (i.e., tree holes instead of nests) may be crucial to avoiding
   potentially extreme ambient temperatures.},

Title = {Visual ecology of true lemurs suggests a cathemeral origin for the
   primate cone opsin polymorphism},
Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {30},
Number = {6},
Pages = {932-942},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. In contrast to the majority of primates, which exhibit dedicated
   diurnality or nocturnality, all species of Eulemur are cathemeral.
   Colour vision, in particular, is strongly affected by the spectral
   composition and intensity of ambient light, and the impact of activity
   period on the evolution of primate colour vision is actively debated.
   2. We studied three groups of wild brown lemurs (Eulemur fulvus) in
   Ankarafantsika National Park, Madagascar, over a 1-year span. We also
   used non-invasive faecal DNA collection and analysis to study the opsin
   genes underlying the colour vision of 24 individuals. We quantified the
   colour and brightness of dietary fruits and modelled the chromaticity
   and discriminability of food objects to different visual phenotypes
   under daylight, twilight and moonlight conditions.
   3. We found that E. fulvus possesses routine dichromacy, unlike its
   congener E. flavifrons, for which polymorphic trichromacy has been
   reported. Our models suggest that dichromacy is well suited to the
   foraging ecology of E. fulvus. The performance of modelled dichromats
   and trichromats is comparable under nocturnal illuminants, and the
   luminance values of most diet items are detectable across light
   conditions. The trichromatic phenotype demonstrates a modest advantage
   under daylight conditions.
   4. Our results, taken together with reports of polymorphic trichromacy
   in E. flavifrons, suggest functional ecological variation in the visual
   system of the genus Eulemur. Interspecific phenotypic variation in the
   colour vision of a genus is both unexpected and instructive.
   5. Ecological differences between species of Eulemur could reveal
   thresholds for the origins of polymorphic trichromacy, which preceded
   the evolution of routine trichromatic vision in humans and other
   primates.},

Title = {Species discovery and validation in a cryptic radiation of endangered

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Implementation of the coalescent model in a Bayesian framework is an
   emerging strength in genetically based species delimitation studies. By
   providing an objective measure of species diagnosis, these methods
   represent a quantitative enhancement to the analysis of multilocus data,
   and complement more traditional methods based on phenotypic and
   ecological characteristics. Recognized as two species 20 years ago,
   mouse lemurs (genus Microcebus) now comprise more than 20 species,
   largely diagnosed from mtDNA sequence data. With each new species
   description, enthusiasm has been tempered with scientific scepticism.
   Here, we present a statistically justified and unbiased Bayesian
   approach towards mouse lemur species delimitation. We perform validation
   tests using multilocus sequence data and two methodologies: (i)
   reverse-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to assess the likelihood
   of different models defined a priori by a guide tree, and (ii) a Bayes
   factor delimitation test that compares different species-tree models
   without a guide tree. We assess the sensitivity of these methods using
   randomized individual assignments, which has been used in BPP studies,
   but not with Bayes factor delimitation tests. Our results validate
   previously diagnosed taxa, as well as new species hypotheses, resulting
   in support for three new mouse lemur species. As the challenge of
   multiple researchers using differing criteria to describe diversity is
   not unique to Microcebus, the methods used here have significant
   potential for clarifying diversity in other taxonomic groups. We echo
   previous studies in advocating that multiple lines of evidence,
   including use of the coalescent model, should be trusted to delimit new
   species.},

Abstract = {Fecal samples from captive and free-living lemurs at Ivoloina Zoological
   Park (IZP) and domestic carnivores from six villages surrounding IZP
   were evaluated between July and August 2012. Free-living lemurs from
   Betampona Natural Reserve (BNR), a relatively pristine rainforest
   fragment 40 km away, were also evaluated in November 2013. All 33 dogs
   sampled (100\%) and 16 of 22 cats sampled (72.7\%) were parasitized,
   predominantly with nematodes (strongyles, ascarids, and spirurids) as
   well as cestodes and protozoans. Similar types of parasites were
   identified in the lemur populations. Identification of spirurid
   nematodes and protozoans in the lemur fecal samples were of concern due
   to previously documented morbidity and mortality in lemurs from these
   parasitic agents. Twelve of 13 free-living (93\%) and 31 of 49 captive
   (63\%) lemurs sampled at IZP had a higher parasite prevalence than
   lemurs at BNR, with 13 of 24 (54\%) being parasitized. The lemurs in BNR
   are likely at risk of increased exposure to these parasites and,
   therefore, increased morbidity and mortality, as humans and their
   domestic animals are encroaching on this natural area.},

Title = {Gait kinetics of above- and below-branch quadrupedal locomotion in

Year = {2016},
Volume = {219},

Abstract = {For primates and other mammals moving on relatively thin branches, the
   ability to effectively adopt both above- and below-branch locomotion is
   seen as critical for successful arboreal locomotion, and has been
   considered an important step prior to the evolution of specialized
   suspensory locomotion within our Order. Yet, little information exists
   on the ways in which limb mechanics change when animals shift from
   above- to below-branch quadrupedal locomotion. This study tested the
   hypothesis that vertical force magnitude and distribution do not vary
   between locomotor modes, but that the propulsive and braking roles of
   the forelimb change when animals shift from above- to below-branch
   quadrupedal locomotion. We collected kinetic data on two lemur species
   (Varecia variegata and Lemur catta) walking above and below an
   instrumented arboreal runway. Values for peak vertical, braking and
   propulsive forces as well as horizontal impulses were collected for each
   limb. When walking below branch, both species demonstrated a significant
   shift in limb kinetics compared with above-branch movement. The forelimb
   became both the primary weight-bearing limb and propulsive organ, while
   the hindlimb reduced its weight-bearing role and became the primary
   braking limb. This shift in force distribution represents a shift toward
   mechanics associated with bimanual suspensory locomotion, a locomotor
   mode unusual to primates and central to human evolution. The ability to
   make this change is not accompanied by significant anatomical changes,
   and thus likely represents an underlying mechanical flexibility present
   in most primates.},

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {Population viability analysis is an important tool to assess the
   extinction risk in small populations of highly specialized primates. The
   blue-eyed black lemur (Eulemur flavifrons) is critically endangered with
   a restricted range in the north-western dry deciduous forest of
   Madagascar, where habitat fragmentation and loss of forest connectivity
   threaten its survival. We performed a population viability analysis
   (PVA) of this lemur in Ankarafa Forest in the Sahamalaza Peninsula
   National Park, north-western Madagascar, to determine the demographic
   parameters most influential for population persistence and to assess
   extinction probabilities. We conducted PVA analyses using different
   demographic parameters which characterize the species including
   reproduction, lifespan and population size using the software VORTEX for
   six scenarios with 100 iterations and simulated over 100 years. The
   simulations suggested the first extinction within 13 years when the
   percentage of habitat destruction increased up to 12\%. Severe habitat
   destruction such as fire and logging was the major cause which led to
   the risk of population extinction. Conservation strategies, in
   particular measures to reduce habitat destruction, are proposed to
   ensure the survival of this critically endangered lemur.},

Title = {The influence of growth patterns on sexual size monomorphism in lemurs},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1670-1681},

Abstract = {The lack of sexual size dimorphism among lemurs is puzzling given the
   high degree of polygyny in this clade. It has been proposed that the
   unique ecological conditions of Madagascar favour rapid completion of
   growth, limiting the opportunities for bimaturism and sexual size
   dimorphism in lemurs. Using recently compiled large data sets on many
   species across the lemur clade, I examined the prevalence of sexual size
   monomorphism of body mass among lemurs and tested the hypothesis that
   limited growth durations constrain sexual size dimorphism. I used
   segmented regression analyses to accurately model growth in each
   species. The majority of species analysed exhibited a period of rapid
   growth followed by a distinct period of slow growth prior to attainment
   of adult body mass. Whereas the first period of growth was constrained
   by the need to attain the majority of adult body mass prior to the onset
   of the infant's first dry season, the subsequent period of slow growth
   was unconstrained and sufficiently long to promote sexual bimaturism.
   Sex differences in the duration and rate of growth during this second
   growth phase appeared to account for the sexual size dimorphism
   exhibited by three lemur species. Therefore, constraints on growth
   processes do not limit sexual size dimorphism in lemurs, and other
   explanations for the prevalence of sexual size monomorphism in this
   clade should be examined. The importance of considering ontogeny in
   future investigations of sexual size monomorphism in lemurs is
   highlighted.},

Title = {Comparative and population mitogenomic analyses of Madagascar's extinct,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {79},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {45-54},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Humans first arrived on Madagascar only a few thousand years ago.
   Subsequent habitat destruction and hunting activities have had
   significant impacts on the island's biodiversity, including the
   extinction of megafauna. For example, we know of 17 recently extinct
   `subfossil' lemur species, all of which were substantially larger (body
   mass similar to 11-160 kg) than any living population of the similar to
   100 extant lemur species (largest body mass similar to 6.8 kg). We used
   ancient DNA and genomic methods to study subfossil lemur extinction
   biology and update our understanding of extant lemur conservation risk
   factors by i) reconstructing a comprehensive phylogeny of extinct and
   extant lemurs, and ii) testing whether low genetic diversity is
   associated with body size and extinction risk. We recovered complete or
   near-complete mitochondrial genomes from five subfossil lemur taxa, and
   generated sequence data from population samples of two extinct and eight
   extant lemur species. Phylogenetic comparisons resolved prior taxonomic
   uncertainties and confirmed that the extinct subfossil species did not
   comprise a single clade. Genetic diversity estimates for the two sampled
   extinct species were relatively low, suggesting small historical
   population sizes. Low genetic diversity and small population sizes are
   both risk factors that would have rendered giant lemurs especially
   susceptible to extinction. Surprisingly, among the extant lemurs, we did
   not observe a relationship between body size and genetic diversity. The
   decoupling of these variables suggests that risk factors other than body
   size may have as much or more meaning for establishing future lemur
   conservation priorities. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Interspecific Semantic Alarm Call Recognition in the Solitary Sahamalaza
   Sportive Lemur, Lepilemur sahamalazensis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {As alarm calls indicate the presence of predators, the correct
   interpretation of alarm calls, including those of other species, is
   essential for predator avoidance. Conversely, communication calls of
   other species might indicate the perceived absence of a predator and
   hence allow a reduction in vigilance. This ``eavesdropping{''} was
   demonstrated in birds and mammals, including lemur species.
   Interspecific communication between taxonomic groups has so far been
   reported in some reptiles and mammals, including three primate species.
   So far, neither semantic nor interspecific communication has been tested
   in a solitary and nocturnal lemur species. The aim of this study was to
   investigate if the nocturnal and solitary Sahamalaza sportive lemur,
   Lepilemur sahamalazensis, is able to access semantic information of
   sympatric species. During the day, this species faces the risk of
   falling prey to aerial and terrestrial predators and therefore shows
   high levels of vigilance. We presented alarm calls of the crested coua,
   the Madagascar magpie-robin and aerial, terrestrial and agitation alarm
   calls of the blue-eyed black lemur to 19 individual Sahamalaza sportive
   lemurs resting in tree holes. Songs of both bird species' and contact
   calls of the blue-eyed black lemur were used as a control. After alarm
   calls of crested coua, Madagascar magpierobin and aerial alarm of the
   blue-eyed black lemur, the lemurs scanned up and their vigilance
   increased significantly. After presentation of terrestrial alarm and
   agitation calls of the blue-eyed black lemur, the animals did not show
   significant changes in scanning direction or in the duration of
   vigilance. Sportive lemur vigilance decreased after playbacks of songs
   of the bird species and contact calls of blue-eyed black lemurs. Our
   results indicate that the Sahamalaza sportive lemur is capable of using
   information on predator presence as well as predator type of different
   sympatric species, using their referential signals to detect predators
   early, and that the lemurs' reactions are based on experience and
   learning.},

Title = {Does Hibernation Slow the ``Pace of Life{''} in Dwarf Lemurs

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {The classic mammalian life history continuum polarizes small-bodied
   species that live fast and die young from larger-bodied species with
   longer life spans and reduced adult mortality rates. Hibernating
   mammals, however, deviate from this pattern and tend to have short
   gestations, accelerated early infant growth in preparation for
   hibernation, retardation of growth and development in association with
   hibernation, and delayed achievement of full adult size and first
   reproduction. This pattern has never been systematically tested in
   hibernating primates. We examine body mass, growth trajectories, dental
   development, and reproductive status of dwarf lemurs (genus
   Cheirogaleus), the only obligate hibernators among primates, to
   determine whether life histories in these small-bodied strepsirrhines
   vary in accord with expectations based on the use of energy-saving
   strategies. We show that this pattern does indeed hold for primates.
   Unlike similarly sized nonhibernating strepsirrhines such as bush babies
   (genus Galago), wild dwarf lemurs display short gestation and lactation
   periods, rapid early (pre-hibernation) growth and development followed
   by retardation of growth and dental development during hibernation,
   delayed attainment of adult size, and delayed first reproduction. We
   conclude that hibernation constrains the degree to which dwarf lemurs
   can experience life in the fast lane. Cheirogaleus have life history
   profiles that are neither fast nor slow but a combination of both.},

   composition and genetic relatedness},
Journal = {CONTRIBUTIONS TO ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {82},
Number = {2},
Pages = {71-83},
Abstract = {Shelters such as leaf nests, tree holes or vegetation tangles play a
   crucial role in the life of many nocturnal mammals. While information
   about characteristics and availability of these resources may help in
   conservation planning, nest use gives an indication about a species'
   social organisation. The northern giant mouse lemur (Mirza zaza) is
   threatened by habitat loss within its restricted range. Our aim was to
   examine nest site preferences of M. zaza and to explore the species'
   social organisation by examining sleeping site aggregation size and
   genetic relatedness within and between such aggregations. In the
   Ankarafa Forest inside Sahamalaza - Iles Radama National Park,
   northwestern Madagascar, we radio-tagged five male and three female M.
   zaza and followed them for 2.5 months during the dry season. We
   identified sleeping trees and observed animals during emergence in the
   evening and return in the morning. We compared sleeping trees and
   microhabitats around nest sites to trees and habitat used during nightly
   activity and to random sites. We found that nests were well covered by
   canopy, even during the dry season, and were located near the tree trunk
   a few meters below the tree top. Nest sites were characterised by large
   (> 30 cm DBH) and tall trees (>16 m) with many lianas. Up to four
   animals shared one to three group-exclusive nests for up to 50 days. Two
   of the nest groups included two and three males with fully developed
   testes. Relatedness data revealed that the adult males sharing nests
   were either unrelated or closely related. These data suggest that M.
   zaza is sleeping in social nest groups including multiple males, which
   is unusual among nocturnal strepsirrhines. Apart from protecting
   suitable sleeping trees and discouraging selective logging of large
   trees, we recommend conducting further studies on the species' social
   organisation throughout an entire season.},

Title = {Anti-predator behaviour of Sahamalaza sportive lemurs, Lepilemur
   sahamalazensis, at diurnal sleeping sites},
Journal = {CONTRIBUTIONS TO ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {82},
Number = {3},
Pages = {131-143},
Abstract = {In response to predation pressure by raptors, snakes, and carnivores,
   primates employ anti-predator behaviours such as avoiding areas of high
   predation risk, cryptic behaviour and camouflage, vigilance and group
   formation (including mixed-species associations), and eavesdropping on
   other species' alarm calls. After detecting a predator, primates can
   produce alarm calls, show predator-specific escape strategies or even
   mob the predator. It remains unclear how solitary nocturnal primates
   respond to diurnal predation pressure while they sleep or rest. The aim
   of this study was to investigate the diurnal anti-predator behaviour of
   the nocturnal and solitary Sahamalaza sportive lemur, Lepilemur
   sahamalazensis, which regularly rests in exposed locations. We observed
   the responses of 32 Sahamalaza sportive lemurs to playbacks of
   territorial calls of an aerial predator (Madagascar harrier hawk),
   mating calls of a terrestrial predator (fossa), and the contact calls of
   a medium-sized bird (crested coua) as a control, at different diurnal
   sleeping sites. Lemurs never showed a flight response after replays of
   predator or control calls, but regularly froze after harrier hawk calls.
   Lemurs scanned the sky immediately after playback of harrier hawk calls,
   and the ground or trees after fossa calls. Lemur vigilance increased
   significantly after both predator calls. After crested coua calls the
   animals became significantly less vigilant, suggesting that contact
   calls of this bird serve as indicators of predator absence. We found no
   response differences between different types of sleeping sites. Our
   results show that resting Sahamalaza sportive lemurs recognise predator
   vocalisations as indicators of increased predation risk, discern
   vocalizations of different predators, and employ anti-predator
   behaviours specific for different predator classes. Their behavioural
   responses while resting or sleeping are comparable to those of active
   primates, and their response rate of 80\% shows that this solitary and
   nocturnal primate is constantly aware of its environment.},

Title = {Sight or Scent: Lemur Sensory Reliance in Detecting Food Quality Varies
   with Feeding Ecology},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 3},
Abstract = {Visual and olfactory cues provide important information to foragers, yet
   we know little about species differences in sensory reliance during food
   selection. In a series of experimental foraging studies, we examined the
   relative reliance on vision versus olfaction in three diurnal, primate
   species with diverse feeding ecologies, including folivorous Coquerel's
   sifakas (Propithecus coquereli), frugivorous ruffed lemurs (Varecia
   variegata spp), and generalist ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). We used
   animals with known color-vision status and foods for which different
   maturation stages (and hence quality) produce distinct visual and
   olfactory cues (the latter determined chemically). We first showed that
   lemurs preferentially selected high-quality foods over low-quality foods
   when visual and olfactory cues were simultaneously available for both
   food types. Next, using a novel apparatus in a series of discrimination
   trials, we either manipulated food quality (while holding sensory cues
   constant) or manipulated sensory cues (while holding food quality
   constant). Among our study subjects that showed relatively strong
   preferences for high-quality foods, folivores required both sensory cues
   combined to reliably identify their preferred foods, whereas generalists
   could identify their preferred foods using either cue alone, and
   frugivores could identify their preferred foods using olfactory, but not
   visual, cues alone. Moreover, when only high-quality foods were
   available, folivores and generalists used visual rather than olfactory
   cues to select food, whereas frugivores used both cue types equally.
   Lastly, individuals in all three of the study species predominantly
   relied on sight when choosing between low-quality foods, but species
   differed in the strength of their sensory biases. Our results generally
   emphasize visual over olfactory reliance in foraging lemurs, but we
   suggest that the relative sensory reliance of animals may vary with
   their feeding ecology.},

Abstract = {Interest in social learning has been fueled by claims of culture in wild
   animals. These remain controversial because alternative explanations to
   social learning, such as asocial learning or ecological differences,
   remain difficult to refute. Compared with laboratory-based research, the
   study of social learning in natural contexts is in its infancy. Here,
   for the first time, we apply two new statistical methods, option-bias
   analysis and network-based diffusion analysis, to data from the wild,
   complemented by standard inferential statistics. Contrary to common
   thought regarding the cognitive abilities of prosimian primates, our
   evidence is consistent with social learning within subgroups in the
   ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), supporting the theory of directed
   social learning (Coussi-Korbel \& Fragaszy, 1995). We also caution that,
   as the toolbox for capturing social learning in natural contexts grows,
   care is required in ensuring that the methods employed are appropriate
   in particular, regarding social dynamics among study subjects.

Title = {Seasonality, sociality, and reproduction: Long-term stressors of

Volume = {57},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Fecal glucocorticoid (fGC) concentrations are reliable, non-invasive
   indices of physiological stress that provide insight into an animal's
   energetic and social demands. To better characterize the long-term
   stressors in adult members of a female-dominant, seasonally breeding
   species - the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) - we first validated fecal
   samples against serum samples and then examined the relationship between
   fGC concentrations and seasonal, social, demographic, genetic, and
   reproductive variables. Between 1999 and 2006, we collected 1386 fecal
   samples from 32 adult, semi-free-ranging animals of both sexes. In males
   and non-pregnant, non-lactating females, fGC concentrations were
   significantly elevated during the breeding season, specifically during
   periods surrounding known conceptions. Moreover, group composition
   (e.g., multi-male versus one-male) significantly predicted the fGC
   concentrations of males and females in all reproductive states. In
   particular, the social instability introduced by intra-male competition
   likely created a stressor for all animals. We found no relationship,
   however, between fGC and the sex, age, or heterozygosity of animals. In
   reproducing females, fGC concentrations were significantly greater
   during lactation than during the pre-breeding period. During pregnancy,
   fGC concentrations were elevated in mid-ranking dams, relative to
   dominant or subordinate dams, and significantly greater during the third
   trimester than during the first or second trimesters. Thus, in the
   absence of nutritional stressors, social dominance was a relatively poor
   predictor of fGC in this female-dominant species. Instead, the animals
   were maximally challenged by their social circumstances and reproductive
   events-males by competition for mating opportunities and females by
   late-term gestation and lactation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {In this study we describe tree hole characteristics and use by the
   hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis) to determine habitat
   needs, potential functions of tree holes and sleeping group composition.
   We radio-tracked 6 adult individuals between April and November 2007 in
   the Analamazaotra Special Reserve. Tree holes were 1-9 m high (median: 7
   m), in living trees measuring 26-54 cm in diameter at breast height
   (median: 32 cm), and could be a limiting resource. Each individual used
   4 or 5 tree holes and had high nest fidelity. Animals most often slept
   socially in mixed-sex groups of 2-6 individuals and occasionally shared
   a tree hole with white-tailed tree rats (Brachytarsomys albicauda). We
   identified two sleeping groups: one composed of 2 adult males, 2 adult
   females and 2 juveniles; one composed of at least 2 adult females and 2
   juveniles. Although tree holes were generally group exclusive, some
   intergroup sleeping was observed. Tree holes could have antipredator and
   thermoregulatory functions. Further research into sleeping hole
   availability, nest use and the degree of niche separation or competition
   between sympatric Cheirogaleidae and other tree hole users (e. g.
   endemic rodents) is needed to assess better the conservation needs of
   these species. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Title = {Inbreeding depression in ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta): genetic
   diversity predicts parasitism, immunocompetence, and survivorship},
Journal = {CONSERVATION GENETICS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1605-1615},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The consequences of inbreeding have been well studied in a variety of
   taxa, revealing that inbreeding has major negative impacts in numerous
   species, both in captivity and in the wild; however, as
   trans-generational health data are difficult to obtain for long-lived,
   free-ranging species, similar analyses are generally lacking for
   nonhuman primates. Here, we examined the long-term effects of inbreeding
   on numerous health estimates in a captive colony of ring-tailed lemurs
   (Lemur catta), housed under semi-natural conditions. This vulnerable
   strepsirrhine primate is endemic to Madagascar, a threatened hotspot of
   biodiversity; consequently, this captive population represents an
   important surrogate. Despite significant attention to maintaining the
   genetic diversity of captive animals, breeding colonies invariably
   suffer from various degrees of inbreeding. We used neutral
   heterozygosity as an estimate of inbreeding and showed that our results
   reflect genome-wide inbreeding, rather than local genetic effects. In
   particular, we found that genetic diversity affects several fitness
   correlates, including the prevalence and burden of Cuterebra parasites
   and a third (N = 6) of the blood parameters analyzed, some of which
   reflect immunocompetence. As a final validation of inbreeding depression
   in this captive colony, we showed that, compared to outbred individuals,
   inbred lemurs were more likely to die earlier from diseases. Through
   these analyses, we highlight the importance of monitoring genetic
   variation in captive animals-a key objective for conservation
   geneticists-and provide insight into the potential negative consequences
   faced by small or isolated populations in the wild.},

Title = {Development and application of a phylogenomic toolkit: Resolving the

Journal = {GENOME RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {489-499},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Lemurs and the other strepsirrhine primates are of great interest to the
   primate genomics community due to their phylogenetic placement as the
   sister lineage to all other primates. Previous attempts to resolve the
   phylogeny of lemurs employed limited mitochondrial or small nuclear data
   sets, with many relationships poorly supported or entirely unresolved.
   We used genomic resources to develop 11 novel markers from nine
   chromosomes, representing similar to 9 kb of nuclear sequence data. In
   combination with previously published nuclear and mitochondrial loci,
   this yields a data set of more than 16 kb and adds similar to 275 kb of
   DNA sequence to current databases. Our phylogenetic analyses confirm
   hypotheses of lemuriform monophyly and provide robust resolution of the
   phylogenetic relationships among the five lemuriform families. We verify
   that the genus Daubentonia is the sister lineage to all other lemurs.
   The Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae are sister taxa and together form
   the sister lineage to the Indriidae; this clade is the sister lineage to
   the Lemuridae. Divergence time estimates indicate that lemurs are an
   ancient group, with their initial diversification occurring around the
   Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. Given the power of this data set to
   resolve branches in a notoriously problematic area of primate phylogeny,
   we anticipate that our phylogenomic toolkit will be of value to other
   studies of primate phylogeny and diversification. Moreover, the methods
   applied will be broadly applicable to other taxonomic groups where
   phylogenetic relationships have been notoriously difficult to resolve.},

Abstract = {Holocene cave, marsh, and stream deposits on the island of Madagascar
   have yielded thousands of ``subfossil{''} specimens that document recent
   megafaunal extinctions. Excavations conducted during the past 15 years
   of archaeological and paleontological sites in northern, northwestern
   and southwestern Madagascar have unearthed, in addition to new specimens
   of extinct lemurs and other megafauna, an abundance of bones of
   still-extant lemur species. These specimens, as well as specimens of
   extant lemurs from subfossil sites excavated in the early and
   mid-1900's, prove that living lemur species once had much broader
   geographic ranges than they have today, and they help to explain the
   currently disjunct distributions of a number of species. This paper
   examines the pattern of distribution of extant primate species at
   subfossil sites, and compares recent to modern primate communities.},

Abstract = {Hapalemur griseus alaotrensis, a relatively small-bodied (1240 +/- 140
   g, n = 58), folivorous lemur, was studied over a period of 15 months at
   Lac Alaotra. The study showed that H. g. alaotrensis had an exclusively
   folivorous diet and mainly fed on leaves and stems of grasses and
   sedges. However, since folivorous diets are known to be poor sources of
   readily available energy and small-bodied animals generally have high
   metabolic requirements, H. g. alaotrensis is expected to have
   adaptations at several levels (morphological, physiological, behavioral)
   to resolve this conflict. The present study on H. g. alaotrensis showed
   that dietary diversity was extremely low and food choice highly
   selective, but chemical composition of the food items yielded no
   evidence that H. g. alaotrensis selected higher quality foods than
   larger folivores, nor was there evidence that H. g. alaotrensis
   minimized energy expenditure at the behavioral or physiological level.
   This lack of behavioral or physiological adaptations to folivory imply
   that the digestive ability of H. g. alaotrensis may be higher than
   predicted for an animal of its size.},

Abstract = {Research on lemurs contributes importantly to evaluation of hypotheses
   on primate development and evolution. A central question about social
   behavior has asked why adult females in many lemur species socially
   dominate males while this trait is rare among Anthropoids and other
   mammals. At present, the favored hypothesis-that female lemurs undertake
   unusually costly reproduction and dominance over males is necessary for
   females to access sufficient nutrition throughout Madagascar's dry
   season-has both supporters and detractors. We propose that confusion
   concerning female dominance in lemurs derives from failing to appreciate
   that adaptation should have minimized prospects for seasonal stress and
   that success during months of food abundance. not months of food
   scarcity, is most likely to be the primary foraging factor influencing
   relative fitness among today's lemurs. Analyses of hair growth, somatic
   growth, food intake, fatness, and two metabolically-active hormones
   (thyroxine and insulin-like growth factor 1) revealed that Lemur catta
   and Eulemur fulvus rufus prepare during the photoperiod of Madagascar's
   annual wet season for upcoming dry seasons and also make adjustments
   during dry seasons that make life less expensive.
   Phenological data from three Malagasy ecosystems suggest that seasonal
   changes in fruit availability may be a less important selection pressure
   in the evolution of lemur life histories than previously thought,
   whereas changes in availabilities of leaves and flowers might be
   crucial. Detailed new fieldwork in nutritional ecology will be required
   to evaluate this hypothesis and also to help determine why Eulemur
   fulvus does not show female dominance. ideally, such work would be
   accompanied by information on metabolic physiology, reproduction, and
   social behavior from a variety of lemurs. More generally, increased
   research on metabolic strategies in primates and other mammals would
   contribute as much to illuminating adaptive patterns of behavior as has
   research on sexual selection and mating strategies to date.},

   fulvus rufus for displacement and feeding were studied in the Kirindy
   Forest/CFPF of southwestern Madagascar. Support dimensions were

   Support orientation was classified in four categories (horizontal,
   oblique, angled, and vertical). Comparisons between the structures
   available in the forest and the supports used by these lemurs showed
   that P. verreauxi used mainly intermediate and large sized supports and
   vertical structures for locomotion; while E. fulvus used the different
   sized supports according to their availability in the forest, but moved
   disproportionally more often quadrupedally on horizontal and oblique
   supports. Both species used small and horizontal supports to feed from.
   Comparing the two lemur species, P. verreauxi used larger trunks and
   branches that were more often vertical or angular than the supports used
   by E. fulvus for locomotion and feeding. In contrast, E. fulvus used
   horizontal branches more frequently for locomotion and especially when

Abstract = {We present preliminary results from an ongoing study of ancient DNA in
   Madagascar's subfossil lemurs. These animals, though extinct, are the
   evolutionary contemporaries of the living lemurs. Any phylogenetic study
   that focuses only on the extant Malagasy primates is therefore
   incomplete. Here, we present a cytochrome b phylogeny that includes
   sequences for Palaeopropithecus and Megaladapis. We also discuss the
   various methodological challenges that we have faced in acquiring these
   sequences along with our solutions for overcoming them. In addition to
   serving as a report of primary data, we hope that this contribution will
   serve as a guide for other projects facing similar challenges. Our
   analyses suggest that Palaeopropithecus is sister to the living indrids,
   as predicted by morphological studies. Contrary to morphological data,
   however, Megaladapis appears to belong to an independent lemuriform
   lineage rather than form a clade with Lepilemur. Our results are subject
   to further testing as longer sequences and additional subfossil taxa are
   added to the study.},

Abstract = {Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot that is facing rapid rates of
   deforestation, habitat destruction, and poverty. Urgent action is
   required to document the status of biodiversity to facilitate
   efficacious conservation plans. With the recent advent of portable and
   affordable genetic technologies, it is now possible to take genomic
   approaches out of the lab and into the field. Mobile genetics labs can
   produce scientifically reproducible data under field conditions,
   dramatically minimizing the time between sample collection and data
   analysis. Here, we show ``proof of concept{''} by deploying miniPCR
   bio's miniaturized thermal cycler alongside Oxford Nanopore's MinION DNA
   sequencer in Madagascar. Specifically, we deployed this technology at
   Anjajavy, northwestern Madagascar for rapid biodiversity assessment. We
   successfully extracted mouse lemur DNA, amplified and sequenced a
   phylogenetically informative mitochondrial gene (cytochrome-b; cytb),
   and thereby confirmed the presence of Danfoss' mouse lemur (M. danfossi)
   within the Anjajavy Reserve. We show that a mobile genetics lab can
   provide expeditious results, and allow scientists to conduct genetic
   analyses, potentially allowing for rapid interventions under emergency
   conditions in situ. Additionally, mobile labs offer powerful training
   opportunities for in-country scientists for whom training opportunities
   were previously confined to ex-situ locations. By bringing genomic
   technologies to Madagascar and other economically challenged and
   biodiverse regions of the world, the next generation of scientists and
   conservationists can more fully implement their leadership roles. Local
   laboratory and training facilities are changing the polarity of research
   programs in Madagascar and empowering national researchers to take
   charge of environmental stewardship.},

Abstract = {For captive primates, greater provisioning of leafy greens or foliage
   can promote natural foraging behavior while boosting fiber intake.
   Recalcitrant fiber, although minimally available to endogenous
   metabolism, is readily fermented into nutrients by gut microbes. Whereas
   most primates in captivity consume fiber-limited diets and harbor
   imbalanced gut microbiota compared to their wild conspecifics, the
   importance of fiber provisioning to primate gut microbiota has
   predominately been studied in folivores. We, therefore, determined if
   commercial lettuce could be used to encourage foraging behavior and
   modify the gut microbiota of captive frugivores. We provisioned ruffed
   lemurs (Varecia rubraandV. variegata) with romaine lettuce, on top of
   the standard dietary fare, for 10 consecutive days. Before and across
   the period of lettuce supplementation, we collected observational data
   of animal feeding and fecal samples for microbiome analysis, determined
   via amplicon sequencing. The ruffed lemurs and their gut microbes
   responded to lettuce provisioning. In particular, younger animals
   readily ate lettuce and showed no decline in consumption across study
   days. When controlling for the effects of host species and social-group
   membership, lettuce consumption shifted the composition of the gut
   microbiome away from each lemur's own baseline, an effect that became
   stronger as the study progressed. In the final study
   days,Ruminococcaceae UCG-008andAkkermansia, microbes typically and
   respectively associated with fiber metabolism and host health, were
   significantly enriched in the consortia of lettuce-provisioned subjects.

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {The scratching-stress linkage has been demonstrated in monkeys and apes
   but never in strepsirrhines, either in the wild or in captivity. We
   analysed data collected on a 14-animal group of Eulemur fulvus in the
   Berenty forest (South Madagascar, March-July 2008). We applied a
   protocol (same weather conditions, time slot, social/activity context,
   forest quadrat, and subgroup formation) involving four conditions, under
   which we recorded the scratching response: predation attempt, reconciled
   conflict, non-reconciled conflict, and control. We found that the
   scratching-stress linkage remains valid in strepsirrhines. Scratching
   increased after predatory attacks by the hawk Polyboroides radiatus and
   intra-group aggressions and decreased after reconciliation, probably
   buffering post-conflict stress. Scratching negatively correlated with
   the linear hierarchy, but only in the absence of stressful events.
   Compared to aggressions, predation attempts induced a greater increase
   in scratching, with dominants showing the highest differential increase.
   Thus, scratching is sensitive to different kinds of homeostasis
   perturbation (predation/aggression) and does not simply provide
   all-or-nothing information. Following a theoretical framework based on
   previous cortisol analyses, we showed that scratching and hormonal data
   converge in indicating that the stress profile of a species is shaped by
   its social network features.},

   diadema and P. verreauxi are compared to each other and to that of P.
   tattersalli, as well as those previously reported of Indri indri and
   Avahi laniger. This comparison shows that the different subspecies of P.
   verreauxi possess the same karyotype and that, among P. diadema, P. d.
   diadema and P. d. perrieri share the same karyotype differing from that
   of P. d. edwardsi by one Robertsonian translocation. The karyotype of P.
   tattersalli differs at least through 17 and 9 rearrangements from those
   of P. diadema and P. verreauxi, respectively. This provides strong
   arguments in favor of its specific status. The phylogenetic diagram
   proposed confirms the early separation of Avahi and the relatively late
   divergence of the four other species. A populational evolution has
   occurred between these four species, P. tattersalli and P. verreauxi
   sharing the largest number of rearrangements ( six), while the numbers
   of rearrangements shared by the other species are two for Indri and P.
   verreauxi, three for P. tattersalli and Indri, and three for P.
   tattersalli and P. diadema. No branch is common to two species of
   Propithecus.},

Abstract = {Cheirogaleidae currently comprises five genera whose relationships
   remain contentious. The taxonomic status and phylogenetic position of
   both Mirza coquereli and Allocebus trichotis are still unclear. The
   taxonomic status of the recently discovered Microcebus ravelobensis (a
   sympatric sibling species of Microcebus murinus) and its phylogenetic
   position also require further examination. A similar to2.4-kb
   mitochondrial DNA sequence including part of the COIII gene, complete
   ND3, ND4L, and ND4 genes, and 5 tRNAs was used to clarify relationships
   among cheirogaleids. Mirza and Microcebus form a clade representing the
   sister group of Allocebus, with a clade containing Cheirogaleus major
   and Cheirogaleus medius diverging first. M. ravelobensis and Microcebus
   rufus form a subclade within Microcebus, with M. murinus as its sister
   group. The molecular data support the generic status of Mirza coquereli
   and species-level divergence of M ravelobensis. Furthermore, ``M.
   rufus{''} may well represent more than one species. (C) 2001 Academic

Title = {Sex differences in audience effects on anogenital scent marking in the
   red-fronted lemur},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {How the presence of conspecifics affects scent mark deposition remains
   an understudied aspect of olfactory communication, even though scent
   marking occurs in different social contexts. Sex differences in
   scent-marking behaviour are common, and sex-specific effects of the
   audience could therefore be expected. We investigated sex differences in
   intra-group audience effects on anogenital scent marking in four groups
   of wild red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) by performing focal
   scent-marking observations. We observed a total of 327 events divided
   into 223 anogenital scent-marking events and 104 pass-by events (i.e.
   passage without scent marking). Using a combination of generalised
   linear mixed models and exponential random graph models, we found that
   scent marking in red-fronted lemurs is associated with some behavioural
   flexibility linked to the composition of the audience at the time of
   scent deposition. In particular, our study revealed sex differences in
   the audience effects, with males being overall more sensitive to their
   audience than females. Moreover, we show that these audience effects
   were dependent on the relative degree of social integration of the focal
   individual compared to that of individuals in the audience (difference
   in Composite Sociality Index) as well as the strength of the dyadic
   affiliative relationship (rank of Dyadic Composite Sociality Index
   within the group). The audience effects also varied as a function of the
   audience radius considered. Hence, we showed that scent marking in
   red-fronted lemurs is associated with some behavioural flexibility
   linked to the composition of the audience, ascribing red-fronted lemurs'
   social competence in this context.},

Abstract = {Background and objectives Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs frequently in
   prosimians, but the cause of these liver cancers in this group is
   unknown. Characterizing the genetic changes associated with
   hepatocellular carcinoma in prosimians may point to possible causes,
   treatments and methods of prevention, aiding conservation efforts that
   are particularly crucial to the survival of endangered lemurs. Although
   genomic studies of cancer in non-human primates have been hampered by a
   lack of tools, recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using
   human exome capture reagents across primates. Methodology In this
   proof-of-principle study, we applied human exome capture reagents to
   tumor-normal pairs from five lemurs with hepatocellular carcinoma to
   characterize the mutational landscape of this disease in lemurs. Results
   Several genes implicated in human hepatocellular carcinoma, including
   ARID1A, TP53 and CTNNB1, were mutated in multiple lemurs, and analysis
   of cancer driver genes mutated in these samples identified enrichment of
   genes involved with TP53 degradation and regulation. In addition to
   these similarities with human hepatocellular carcinoma, we also noted
   unique features, including six genes that contain mutations in all five
   lemurs. Interestingly, these genes are infrequently mutated in human
   hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting potential differences in the
   etiology and/or progression of this cancer in lemurs and humans.
   Conclusions and implications Collectively, this pilot study suggests
   that human exome capture reagents are a promising tool for genomic
   studies of cancer in lemurs and other non-human primates. Lay Summary
   Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs frequently in prosimians, but the cause
   of these liver cancers is unknown. In this proof-of-principle study, we
   applied human DNA sequencing tools to tumor-normal pairs from five
   lemurs with hepatocellular carcinoma and compared the lemur mutation
   profiles to those of human hepatocellular carcinomas.},

Title = {The gut microbiome as an indicator of habitat disturbance in a
   Critically Endangered lemur},
Journal = {BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {Background Habitat disturbance affects the biology and health of animals
   globally. Understanding the factors that contribute to the differential
   responses of animals to habitat disturbance is critical for
   conservation. The gut microbiota represents a potential pathway through
   which host responses to habitat disturbance might be mediated. However,
   a lack of quantitative environmental data in many gut microbiome (GM)
   studies of wild animals limits our ability to pinpoint mechanisms
   through which habitat disturbance affects the GM. Here, we examine the
   impact of anthropogenic habitat disturbance on the diet and GM of the
   Critically Endangered black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata
   editorum). We collected fecal samples and behavioral data from Varecia
   occupying habitats qualitatively categorized as primary forest,
   moderately disturbed forest, and heavily disturbed forest. Results
   Varecia diet and GM composition differed substantially across sites.
   Dietary richness predicted GM richness across sites, and overall GM
   composition was strongly correlated to diet composition. Additionally,
   the consumption of three specific food items positively correlated to
   the relative abundances of five microbial strains and one microbial
   genus across sites. However, diet did not explain all of the GM
   variation in our dataset, and differences in the GM were detected that
   were not correlated with diet, as measured. Conclusions Our data suggest
   that diet is an important influence on the Varecia GM across habitats
   and thus could be leveraged in novel conservation efforts in the future.
   However, other factors such as contact with humans should also be
   accounted for. Overall, we demonstrate that quantitative data describing
   host habitats must be paired with GM data to better target the specific
   mechanisms through which environmental change affects the GM.},

Abstract = {The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), one of the world's smallest
   primates, is thought to share a similar ecological niche and many
   anatomical traits with early euprimates. As a result, it has been
   considered a suitable model system for early primate physiology and
   behavior. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that mouse lemurs
   have comparable cognitive abilities and cortical functional organization
   as haplorhines. Finally, the small brain size of mouse lemurs provides
   us with actual lower limits for miniaturization of functional brain
   circuits within the primate clade. Considering its phylogenetic position
   and early primate-like traits, the mouse lemurs are a perfect model
   species to study the early evolution of primate brains.},

Title = {The influence of seasonality, anthropogenic disturbances, and cyclonic

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic tropical deforestation and degradation imminently threaten
   primates today. Primates living in these disturbed habitats may also be
   subjected to increasingly severe tropical storms such as cyclones or
   hurricanes. These disturbances pose an immediate risk to their
   livelihood and can dramatically alter their habitats, in turn
   potentially shifting behavioral patterns. We had the unique opportunity
   to study the effects of seasonality, anthropogenic disturbances, and the
   immediate effects of a cyclone on the behavior of the critically
   endangered northern sportive lemur (NSL) in an anthropogenically
   disturbed forest in Madagascar. Cyclone Enawo made landfall on March 7,
   2017 in northeast Madagascar with sustained wind speeds of 230 km/h. We
   collected behavioral data on nine individual NSLs during both wet and
   dry seasons, before and after Cyclone Enawo, and in areas of differing
   human activity, using scan sampling at 5-min intervals. We ran
   generalized linear mixed models to test the effects of seasonality and
   disturbances on behavior. We found that NSLs spent more time feeding in
   dry months compared with wet (Z = -4.21, p < 0.001). More specifically,
   they spent more time-consuming leaves and vine species in the dry season
   (Z = -2.26, p = 0.02; Z = -2.3; p = 0.02). We also found that NSLs were
   observed at lower heights in trees after the cyclone (Z = -2.45; p =
   0.016) and spent more time in the interior portions of trees (Z = 3.44;
   p < 0.001), perhaps due to extensive limb damage of emergent trees
   documented after the cyclone. Our analyses show that seasonality
   affected most aspects of NSL behavior, followed by the effects of
   Cyclone Enawo, with anthropogenic disturbances having little effect. Our
   data suggest that the behavioral flexibility of NSLs in response to
   predictable seasonality may enable them to respond similarly to
   stochastic climatic disturbances. However, their generalist diet may
   allow them to persist in anthropogenically disturbed landscapes without
   the need to greatly alter their behavior.},

Title = {Population Dynamics of Nocturnal Lemurs in Littoral Forest Fragments:
   The Importance of Long-Term Monitoring},

Abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation pose a significant threat to many primate
   species worldwide, yet community-level responses are complex and
   nuanced. Despite repeated calls from primatologists and the wider
   conservation community to increase monitoring initiatives that assess
   long-term population dynamics, such studies remain rare. Here we
   summarize results from a longitudinal study set in the littoral forests
   of southeast Madagascar. Littoral forests are a useful model for
   monitoring lemur population dynamics, as they are relatively well
   studied and their highly fragmented nature enables the effect of forest
   size and anthropogenic impacts to be examined. This study focuses on
   three Endangered nocturnal lemur species-Avahi meridionalis,
   Cheirogaleus thomasi, and Microcebus tanosi-across three forest
   fragments of different size and with different usage histories. Between
   2011 and 2018, we walked 285 km of line transect and recorded 1968 lemur
   observations. Based on distance sampling analysis our results indicate
   that nocturnal lemurs respond to forest patch size and to levels of
   forest degradation in species-specific ways. The largest species, A.
   meridionalis, declined in density and encounter rate over time across
   the three study forests. C. thomasi populations appeared stable in all
   three fragments, with densities increasing in the most degraded forest.
   M. tanosi encounter rates were extremely low across all study fragments
   but were lowest in the most heavily degraded forest fragment. Our
   results emphasize the importance of localized pressures and
   species-specific responses on population dynamics. Monitoring population
   trends can provide an early warning signal of species loss and
   species-specific responses can inform crucial intervention strategies.},

Title = {Molecular Adaptation to Folivory and the Conservation Implications for
   Madagascar's Lemurs},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {The lemurs of Madagascar include numerous species characterized by
   folivory across several families. Many extant lemuriform folivores exist
   in sympatry in Madagascar's remaining forests. These species avoid
   feeding competition by adopting different dietary strategies within
   folivory, reflected in behavioral, morphological, and microbiota
   diversity across species. These conditions make lemurs an ideal study
   system for understanding adaptation to leaf-eating. Most folivorous
   lemurs are also highly endangered. The significance of folivory for
   conservation outlook is complex. Though generalist folivores may be
   relatively well equipped to survive habitat disturbance, specialist
   folivores occupying narrow dietary niches may be less resilient.
   Characterizing the genetic bases of adaptation to folivory across
   species and lineages can provide insights into their differential
   physiology and potential to resist habitat change. We recently reported
   accelerated genetic change in RNASE1, a gene encoding an enzyme (RNase
   1) involved in molecular adaptation in mammalian folivores, including
   various monkeys and sifakas (genus Propithecus; family Indriidae). Here,
   we sought to assess whether other lemurs, including phylogenetically and
   ecologically diverse folivores, might show parallel adaptive change in
   RNASE1 that could underlie a capacity for efficient folivory. We
   characterized RNASE1 in 21 lemur species representing all five families
   and members of the three extant folivorous lineages: (1) bamboo lemurs
   (family Lemuridae), (2) sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), and (3)
   indriids (family Indriidae). We found pervasive sequence change in
   RNASE1 across all indriids, a d(N)/d(S) value > 3 in this clade, and
   evidence for shared change in isoelectric point, indicating altered
   enzymatic function. Sportive and bamboo lemurs, in contrast, showed more
   modest sequence change. The greater change in indriids may reflect a
   shared strategy emphasizing complex gut morphology and microbiota to
   facilitate folivory. This case study illustrates how genetic analysis
   may reveal differences in functional traits that could influence
   species' ecology and, in turn, their resilience to habitat change.
   Moreover, our results support the body of work demonstrating that not
   all primate folivores are built the same and reiterate the need to avoid
   generalizations about dietary guild in considering conservation outlook,
   particularly in lemurs where such diversity in folivory has probably led
   to extensive specialization via niche partitioning.},

Abstract = {Quaternary climatic changes have been invoked as important drivers of
   species diversification worldwide. However, the impact of such changes
   on vegetation and animal population dynamics in tropical regions remains
   debated. To overcome this uncertainty, we integrated high-resolution
   paleoenvironmental reconstructions from a sedimentary record covering
   the past 25,000 years with demographic inferences of a forest-dwelling
   primate species (Microcebus arnholdi), in northern Madagascar. Result
   comparisons suggest that climate changes through the African Humid
   Period (15.2 - 5.5 kyr) strongly affected the demographic dynamics of M.
   arnholdi. We further inferred a population decline in the last
   millennium which was likely shaped by the combination of climatic and
   anthropogenic impacts. Our findings demonstrate that population
   fluctuations in Malagasy wildlife were substantial prior to a
   significant human impact. This provides a critical knowledge of
   climatically driven, environmental and ecological changes in the past,
   which is essential to better understand the dynamics and resilience of
   current biodiversity.
   Teixeira et al. combine genomic and palaeoecological datasets to infer
   the demographic history of a forest-dwelling lemur in Madagascar. Their
   findings indicate that historical environmental changes drove population
   demographic changes prior to anthropogenic impact, which was detected in
   the study region during the last millennium.},

Abstract = {Mutations are the raw material on which evolution acts, and knowledge of
   their frequency and genomic distribution is crucial for understanding
   how evolution operates at both long and short timescales. At present,
   the rate and spectrum of de novo mutations have been directly
   characterized in relatively few lineages. Our study provides the first
   direct mutation-rate estimate for a strepsirrhine (i.e., the lemurs and
   lorises), which comprises nearly half of the primate clade. Using
   high-coverage linked-read sequencing for a focal quartet of gray mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus murinus), we estimated the mutation rate to be among
   the highest calculated for a mammal at 1.52 x 10(-8) (95\% credible
   interval: 1.28 x 10(-8)-1.78 x 10(-8)) mutations/site/generation.
   Further, we found an unexpectedly low count of paternal mutations, and
   only a modest overrepresentation of mutations at CpG sites. Despite the
   surprising nature of these results, we found both the rate and spectrum
   to be robust to the manipulation of a wide range of computational
   filtering criteria. We also sequenced a technical replicate to estimate
   a false-negative and false-positive rate for our data and show that any
   point estimate of a de novo mutation rate should be considered with a
   large degree of uncertainty. For validation, we conducted an independent
   analysis of context-dependent substitution types for gray mouse lemur
   and five additional primate species for which de novo mutation rates
   have also been estimated. These comparisons revealed general consistency
   of the mutation spectrum between the pedigree-based and the
   substitution-rate analyses for all species compared.},

   odour in specific places to transmit a message to other animals). We
   studied two pairs of crowned lemurs at Colchester and Twycross zoos (UK)
   by combining behavioural observations and chemical analyses of odour
   secretions released via scent-marking. Male lemurs scent-marked most
   frequently, showing three types of behaviours: ano-genital marking for
   applying their scent onto females; head marking for placing their
   secretions on or near the mark left by another individual; and wrist
   marking to deposit their mark in specific meaningful areas of the
   enclosure. Female lemurs displayed only ano-genital marking, primarily
   on feeding devices. We detected a total of 38 volatile compounds in male
   ano-genital scent-marks and 26 in female ano-genital odour secretions,
   including many compounds that have been identified in odour profiles of
   other primates. In conclusion, we found sexual dimorphism in crowned
   lemur scent-marking. In males, head and wrist marking behaviours would
   play defensive territorial functions, while ano-genital marking may be
   related to socio-sexual communication; female ano-genital marking could
   be involved in resource defense. This study contributes to improving our
   understanding of lemur communication. Primates are traditionally
   considered to have a poor sense of smell. However, olfaction is
   important for non-human primates as demonstrated by conspicuous
   scent-marking behaviours in lemurs. We studied two pairs (n = 4) of
   crowned lemurs (Eulemur coronatus) housed at Colchester and Twycross
   zoos (UK) by combining behavioural observations and chemical analyses of
   scent-marks and glandular swabs. We recorded observations of olfactory
   behaviours for 201 h using instantaneous scan sampling. We investigated
   the volatile compounds of ano-genital odour secretions (n = 16) using
   solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
   Males scent-marked most frequently, displaying ano-genital marking for
   allomarking, head marking for countermarking and wrist marking in
   specific areas of the enclosure. Females displayed ano-genital marking,
   predominantly on feeding devices. We detected a total of 38 volatile
   components in all male ano-genital scent-marks and 26 in all female
   samples of ano-genital odour secretions, including a series of esters,
   aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, terpenes, volatile fatty acids and
   hydrocarbons that have been identified in odour profiles of other
   primates. In conclusion, we found sexual dimorphism in crowned lemur
   scent-marking. Male head and wrist marking behaviours might play
   defensive territorial functions, while ano-genital marking would be
   related to socio-sexual communication as chemical mate-guarding. Female
   ano-genital marking might be involved in resource defense.},

Title = {Evolutionary and phylogenetic insights from a nuclear genome sequence of

Abstract = {No endemic Madagascar animal with body mass >10 kg survived a relatively
   recent wave of extinction on the island. From morphological and isotopic
   analyses of skeletal ``subfossil{''} remains we can reconstruct some of
   the biology and behavioral ecology of giant lemurs (primates; up to
   similar to 160 kg) and other extraordinary Malagasy megafauna that
   survived into the past millennium. Yet, much about the evolutionary
   biology of these now-extinct species remains unknown, along with
   persistent phylogenetic uncertainty in some cases. Thankfully, despite
   the challenges of DNA preservation in tropical and subtropical
   environments, technical advances have enabled the recovery of ancient
   DNA from some Malagasy subfossil specimens. Here, we present a nuclear
   genome sequence (similar to 2x coverage) for one of the largest extinct
   lemurs, the koala lemur Megaladapis edwardsi (similar to 85 kg). To
   support the testing of key phylogenetic and evolutionary hypotheses, we
   also generated high-coverage nuclear genomes for two extant lemurs,
   Eulemur rufifrons and Lepilemur mustelinus, and we aligned these
   sequences with previously published genomes for three other extant
   lemurs and 47 nonlemur vertebrates. Our phylogenetic results confirm
   that Megaladapis is most closely related to the extant Lemuridae
   (typified in our analysis by E. rufifrons) to the exclusion of L.
   mustelinus, which contradicts morphology-based phylogenies. Our
   evolutionary analyses identified significant convergent evolution
   between M. edwardsi and an extant folivore (a colobine monkey) and an
   herbivore (horse) in genes encoding proteins that function in plant
   toxin biodegradation and nutrient absorption. These results suggest that
   koala lemurs were highly adapted to a leaf-based diet, which may also
   explain their convergent craniodental morphology with the small-bodied
   folivore Lepilemur.},

Abstract = {Several studies have shown higher costs of rearing sons than daughters
   in mammals where males are larger than females. These studies typically
   focus on females by examining how the offspring sex ratio during a
   single reproductive event affected mothers' subsequent reproduction or
   survival probability. Here, we examine relationships between offspring
   sex ratio during single or multiple reproductive events and several
   survival metrics in mothers and fathers, using data from zoo-housed
   tigers (Panthera tigris) and ruffed lemurs (Varecia sp.). Our analyses
   failed to reveal an overall cost of reproduction or a higher cost of
   sons to mothers. In male ruffed lemurs, the proportion of sons produced
   during early life (before 10 years old) was negatively correlated with
   lifespan later in life. In tigers, males with a higher proportion of
   sons during their lifetime had shorter lifespans. One likely mechanism
   is the difference in testosterone levels between males: a high
   concentration of testosterone can increase the proportion of sons and
   compromise immune function. Our results suggest studies in wild
   populations should address the outstanding challenge of understanding
   consequences of sex allocation for males, and open an opportunity to
   predict lifespan in an applied conservation context.},

Title = {Insights from macroevolutionary modelling and ancestral state

Abstract = {Background Lemurs once rivalled the diversity of rest of the primate
   order despite thier confinement to the island of Madagascar. We test the
   adaptive radiation model of Malagasy lemur diversity using a novel
   combination of phylogenetic comparative methods and geometric methods
   for quantifying tooth shape. Results We apply macroevolutionary model
   fitting approaches and disparity through time analysis to dental
   topography metrics associated with dietary adaptation, an aspect of
   mammalian ecology which appears to be closely related to diversification
   in many clades. Metrics were also reconstructed at internal nodes of the
   lemur tree and these reconstructions were combined to generate dietary
   classification probabilities at internal nodes using discriminant
   function analysis. We used these reconstructions to calculate rates of
   transition toward folivory per million-year intervals. Finally, lower
   second molar shape was reconstructed at internal nodes by modelling the
   change in shape of 3D meshes using squared change parsimony along the
   branches of the lemur tree. Our analyses of dental topography metrics do
   not recover an early burst in rates of change or a pattern of early
   partitioning of subclade disparity. However, rates of change in
   adaptations for folivory were highest during the Oligocene, an interval
   of possible forest expansion on the island. Conclusions There was no
   clear phylogenetic signal of bursts of morphological evolution early in
   lemur history. Reconstruction of the molar morphologies corresponding to
   the ancestral nodes of the lemur tree suggest that this may have been
   driven by a shift toward defended plant resources, however. This
   suggests a response to the ecological opportunity offered by expanding
   forests, but not necessarily a classic adaptive radiation initiated by
   dispersal to Madagascar.},

Title = {Variation in predicted COVID-19 risk among lemurs and lorises},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {83},
Number = {6, SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which in humans leads to the disease
   COVID-19, has caused global disruption and more than 2 million
   fatalities since it first emerged in late 2019. As we write, infection
   rates are at their highest point globally and are rising extremely
   rapidly in some areas due to more infectious variants. The primary
   target of SARS-CoV-2 is the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting
   enzyme-2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene predict that
   many nonhuman primates are also likely to be highly susceptible to
   infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order.
   Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid
   conservation, while others exhibit high variability at this locus. As an
   example of the latter, analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2 sequences
   to date indicate large variation among lemurs and lorises compared to
   other primate clades despite low sampling effort. Here, we report ACE2
   gene and protein sequences for 71 individual strepsirrhines, spanning 51
   species and 19 genera. Our study reinforces previous results while
   finding additional variability in other strepsirrhine species, and
   suggests several clades of lemurs have high potential susceptibility to
   SARS-CoV-2 infection. Troublingly, some species, including the rare and
   endangered aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), as well as those in
   the genera Avahi and Propithecus, may be at high risk. Given that lemurs
   are endemic to Madagascar and among the primates at highest risk of
   extinction globally, further understanding of the potential threat of
   COVID-19 to their health should be a conservation priority. All feasible
   actions should be taken to limit their exposure to SARS-CoV-2.},

Title = {The Vocal Repertoire of the Northern Giant Mouse Lemur (Mirza zaza) in
   Captivity},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},

Abstract = {Detailed knowledge of a species' vocal repertoire is an essential
   component for the interpretation of its social interactions and
   behavior. In the case of cryptic nocturnal primates, vocalizations are
   also a valuable tool for species identification, and possibly to
   discriminate between the sexes and/or group memberships during
   noninvasive field identification, monitoring, and conservation efforts.
   Here we describe the vocal repertoire of the northern giant mouse lemur,
   Mirza zaza, a small nocturnal primate endemic to northwest Madagascar,
   and analyze the repertoire to identify vocalizations for field
   identification and monitoring. We recorded vocalizations of a captive
   population of 40 M. zaza individuals at the Duke Lemur Center, USA, with
   detailed observations of call-associated behaviors of eight individuals
   in two groups. Based on their acoustic structure, we identified 10
   different call types, which were correctly classified (92.8\%) by a
   discriminant function analysis. The described adult call types occurred
   in the context of advertisement, alarm, affiliative behavior, agonistic
   behavior, and locomotion. Nine of these call types were already present
   in infants. To aid call classification, we used the acoustic structure
   of calls to construct a set of call classification rules for M. zaza.
   Among the loud vocalizations that were candidates for acoustic
   monitoring we document significant sex differences in the acoustic
   structure of trill calls of M. zaza, and significant differences between
   two groups in their loud whistle calls. The vocal repertoire described
   here will not only form the basis for future comparative and
   phylogenetic studies of lemur vocalizations; it will also enable rapid
   identification of this species for noninvasive acoustic surveys in their
   natural habitat to assess and monitor population densities and establish
   range boundaries, thus aiding conservation efforts for this threatened
   lemur species.},

Title = {Prolonged Torpor in Goodman's Mouse Lemur (Microcebus lehilahytsara)
   from the High-Altitude Forest of Tsinjoarivo, Central-Eastern Madagascar},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The nocturnal mouse and dwarf lemurs from Madagascar are known to
   express heterothermy. Whereas dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus) are obligate
   hibernators, mouse lemurs (Microcebus) can express a great range of
   heterothermic responses, including daily torpor, prolonged torpor or
   hibernation, depending on the species, population or individual.
   Although there is indirect evidence of heterothermy in a handful of
   mouse lemur species, direct physiological confirmation is currently
   limited to four: Microcebus berthae(dry forest), M. ravelobensis(dry
   forest), M. griseorufus(spiny forest), M. murinus(dry forest/littoral
   forest). We studied Goodman's mouse lemurs (M. lehilahytsara) at the
   high-altitude rain forest of Tsinjoarivo, central-eastern Madagascar. We
   captured a total of 45 mouse lemurs during pre- and post-torpor seasons.
   We recorded body mass and measured tail base circumference, which was
   used as proxy for fattening. Moreover, using telemetry, we obtained
   sporadic skin temperature data from a mouse lemur female between March
   and June. From June 9 to 16, we performed more intensive data sampling
   and thereby confirmed the expression of prolonged torpor in this female,
   when skin temperatures consistently displayed values below 25 degrees C
   for more than 24 h. We documented 3 torpor bouts, 2 of which were
   interrupted by naturally occurring arousals. Torpor bout duration ranged
   from approximately 47 to maximally about 69 h. We found similarities
   between the Goodman's mouse lemur torpor profile and those known from
   other species, including the fact that only a portion of any mouse lemur
   population deposits fat stores and undergoes torpor in a given year. The
   variable expression of heterothermy in Goodman's mouse lemurs contrasts
   with obligatory hibernation displayed by two sympatric species of dwarf
   lemurs, suggesting cheirogaleids use a range of metabolic strategies to
   cope with seasonality and cold environments.},

Title = {Effects of seasonality and previous logging on faecal

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},

Month = {OCT 8},
Abstract = {Gastrointestinal helminth-microbiota associations are shaped by various
   ecological processes. The effect of the ecological context of the host
   on the bacterial microbiome and gastrointestinal helminth parasites has
   been tested in a number of ecosystems and experimentally. This study
   takes the important step to look at these two groups at the same time
   and to start to examine how these communities interact in a changing
   host environment. Fresh faecal samples (N=335) from eight wild Eulemur
   populations were collected over 2 years across Madagascar. We used 16S
   ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to characterise the bacterial microbiota
   composition, and faecal flotation to isolate and morphologically
   identify nematode eggs. Infections with nematodes of the genera
   Callistoura and Lemuricola occurred in all lemur populations.
   Seasonality significantly contributed to the observed variation in
   microbiota composition, especially in the dry deciduous forest.
   Microbial richness and Lemuricola spp. infection prevalence were highest
   in a previously intensely logged site, whereas Callistoura spp. showed
   no such pattern. In addition, we observed significant correlations
   between gastrointestinal parasites and bacterial microbiota composition
   in these lemurs, with 0.4-0.7\% of the variation in faecal bacterial
   microbiota composition being explained by helminth infections. With this
   study, we show effects of environmental conditions on gastrointestinal
   nematodes and bacterial interactions in wild lemurs and believe it is
   essential to consider the potential role of microbiome-parasite
   associations on the hosts' GI stability, health, and survival.},

Abstract = {The outcome of restoration plantings depends on the selection of plant
   species and their traits. Regeneration could be facilitated and
   diversified by attracting native seed dispersers into the sites to be
   restored. To provide a basis for the selection of plant species that
   Lemur food plantscould attract lemurs, the main seed dispersers in
   Madagascar, I compiled a list of known lemur food plants (LFP). A
   literature search revealed 204 data sources from 64 study sites on the
   exploitation of plants by 56 free-ranging lemur species. I aggregated
   the information, updated the taxonomy, and included further aspects,
   such as plant origin and life form, which may be of relevance for
   restoration. Lemur species exploited mainly fruits and leaves of 1,026
   plant species (9.14\% of all vascular plant species present in
   Madagascar), from 599 genera and 147 families. The data revealed many
   promising aspects for restoration, such as integrating the 10 most
   important LFP that are also used by people. The integration of LFP would
   increase the value of restoration areas for both animals and humans.
   Despite some limitations, the assembled database can provide assistance
   and guidance in the selection of plant species for restoration programs,
   whereby facilitating future regeneration may be accomplished passively
   through lemur seed dispersal.},

Abstract = {During routine surveys of owl distributions on St. Catherines Island, we
   observed naturalized ring-tailed lemurs displaying antipredator
   responses to owl auditory cues. In the 32 y since the introduction of
   ring-tailed lemurs to the island, two successful depredation events by
   two different owl species have been documented. We investigated the
   behavioral response of ring-tailed lemurs to determine if they responded
   consistently to social calls from all three owl species present on St.
   Catherines Island despite size differences among the owl species that
   could affect the likelihood of them serving as predators on ring-tailed
   lemurs. We observed while ring-tailed lemurs responded to all the
   auditory owl calls, they exhibited more intense, longer and more
   consistent responses to the two larger owl species - the barred owl and
   great horned owl - relative to the small Eastern screech owl. These data
   suggest naturalized species are capable of learning threat-sensitive
   antipredator behaviors to novel predator communities.},

Abstract = {The geographic distribution of a species can provide insights into its
   population size, ecology, evolution, and how it responded to past (and
   may respond to future) environmental change. Improving our knowledge of
   the distribution of threatened species thus is a high priority in
   assessing their conservation status. However, there are few data
   available for many recently described yet understudied and potentially
   threatened primate taxa, making their conservation difficult. Here, we
   investigated the distribution of the Montagne d'Ambre fork-marked lemur,
   Phaner electromontis, a threatened nocturnal primate endemic to northern
   Madagascar and classified as Endangered by the IUCN. Because fork-marked
   lemurs are highly vocal, we used acoustic surveys to assess the species'
   presence-absence and relative population density within 66 distinct
   forest survey sites in northern Madagascar. Further, we compared data
   among five forest types within the study area and investigated the
   relationship between relative population density and climate variables.
   We report the presence of P. electromontis in 22 study sites; several of
   these populations were unknown previously. Although we found P.
   electromontis most frequently in drytransitional forests, our results
   suggest that geography (spatial autocorrelation) rather than
   enviromnental variables explains the species' distribution. We
   hypothesize that environmental unpredictability and gummivory, combined
   with the presence of several distinct Phaner species in the studied
   area, could explain the observed distribution.},

Abstract = {Host-associated microbiomes shape and are shaped by myriad processes
   that ultimately delineate their symbiotic functions. Whereas a host's
   stable traits, such as its lineage, relate to gross aspects of its
   microbiome structure, transient factors, such as its varying
   physiological state, relate to shorter term, structural variation. Our
   understanding of these relationships in primates derives principally
   from anthropoid studies and would benefit from a broader, comparative
   perspective. We thus examined the vaginal, labial and axillary
   microbiota of captive, female ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) and
   Coquerel's sifakas (Propithecus coquereli), across an ovarian cycle, to
   better understand their relation to stable (e.g. species identity/mating
   system, body site) and transient (e.g. ovarian hormone concentration,
   forest access) host features. We used 16S amplicon sequencing to
   determine microbial composition and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
   to measure serum hormone concentrations. We found marked variation in
   microbiota diversity and community composition between lemur species and
   their body sites. Across both host species, microbial diversity was
   significantly correlated with ovarian hormone concentrations: negatively
   with progesterone and positively with estradiol. The hosts' differential
   forest access related to the diversity of environmental microbes,
   particularly in axillary microbiomes. Such transient endogenous and
   exogenous modulators have potential implications for host reproductive
   health and behavioral ecology.},

Title = {Occurrence of lemurs in landscapes and their species-specific scale
   responses to habitat loss},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Number = {4, SI},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Studies on the impact of habitat loss on species occurrence consistently
   find that the amount of habitat (measured as patch area) is a major
   determinant of species occurrence at a patch-level. However, patch-level
   research may fail to detect important patterns and processes only
   observable at a landscape-level. A landscape-level approach that
   incorporates species-specific scale responses is needed to better
   understand what drives species occurrence. Our aim was to determine the
   landscape-level scale of effect of habitat amount on the occurrence of
   three species of nocturnal lemurs (Cheirogaleus medius, Microcebus
   murinus, and M. ravelobensis). We surveyed line transects to determine
   the occurrence of three lemur species within a fragmented landscape of
   deciduous dry forest and anthropogenic grassland in northwestern
   Madagascar. To determine the scale of effect of habitat loss on lemur
   occurrence, we compared logistic regression models of occurrence against
   habitat amount among eight different landscape scales using Akaike's
   Information Criterion values. We found differing scale responses among
   the lemurs in our study. Occurrence of C. medius responded to habitat
   amount at scales between 0.5-4 ha, M. murinus at scales between 1 and 4
   ha and M. ravelobensis at scales between 0.125 and 4 ha. We suggest that
   the scale of effect for C. medius is mediated by their ability to
   hibernate. A relatively lower scale-response for Microcebus spp. likely
   reflect their omnivorous diet, small habitat requirements, and limited
   dispersal ability. Differences in scale responses between M. murinus and
   M. ravelobensis are likely a result of differing dispersal ability and
   responses to edge effects between these species. Our study is among the
   first on lemurs to show the value of a landscape-level approach when
   assessing the effects of habitat loss on species occurrence.},

Abstract = {Ecometric modelling relates spatial environmental variables to
   phenotypic characters to better understand morphological adaptation and
   help reconstruct past environments. Here, the community means of the
   dental topography metrics Dirichlet normal energy (DNE) and orientation
   patch count (OPC) are tested against annual precipitation and
   precipitation seasonality among lemurs across Madagascar. Dry, seasonal
   environments are expected to be associated with high DNE and OPC, as
   lemurs living in these environments are more likely to rely on tougher
   foods. Ecometric models are also used to calculate ecometric loads for
   lemur taxa hypothesized to be experiencing evolutionary disequilibria
   and to reconstruct annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality at
   the similar to 500 years BP subfossil cave site of Ankilitelo. DNE was
   highest in highly seasonal but wet environments. Seasonal exploitation
   of fallback foods and the availability of new leaves during wet periods
   may be most important in driving community DNE. OPC was weakly predicted
   by annual precipitation and seasonality but its distribution appeared to
   be driven by a stepwise increase in its community values in rainforest
   environments. The lemur fauna from Ankilitelo appears to resemble
   communities from moister environments than occur in the spiny desert
   zone in which the site is situated today.},

Abstract = {Scientific study of lemurs, a group of primates found only on
   Madagascar, is crucial for understanding primate evolution.
   Unfortunately, lemurs are among the most endangered animals in the
   world, so there is a strong impetus to maximize as much scientific data
   as possible from available physical specimens. MicroCT scanning efforts
   at Duke University have resulted in scans of more than 100 strepsirrhine
   cadavers representing 18 species from the Duke Lemur Center. An error
   study of the microCT scanner recovered less than 0.3\% error at multiple
   resolution levels. Scans include specimen overviews and focused,
   high-resolution selections of complex anatomical regions (e.g., cranium,
   hands, feet). Scans have been uploaded to MorphoSource, an online
   digital repository for 3D data. As captive (but free ranging)
   individuals, these specimens have a wealth of associated information
   that is largely unavailable for wild populations, including detailed
   life history data. This digital collection maximizes the information
   obtained from rare and endangered animals with minimal degradation of
   the original specimens.},

Title = {Convergent evolution in lemur environmental niches},

Volume = {47},
Number = {4},
Pages = {795-806},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Aim To test the hypothesis that adaptive convergent evolution of climate
   niches occurred in multiple independent lemur lineages. Location
   Madagascar. Taxon Lemurs. Methods I collected climate and altitude data
   from WorldClim and summarized the niches of almost all living lemurs (83
   species) into phylogenetically controlled principal components. To test
   for convergent evolution, I searched for multiple, similar climate
   optima using multi-peak Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models (surface, l1-ou,
   bayou). I compared the observed level of climate convergence to that
   simulated under neutral and single-optimum models. To test if
   behavioural or morphological traits were related to climate niches, I
   used phylogenetic regressions with activity pattern, diet, and body
   size. Results From an ancestral niche with high rainfall and low
   seasonality, four lemur lineages independently converged on climate
   niche optima characterized by high temperatures and low rainfall,
   supporting adaptive evolution in southwest deciduous and arid habitats.
   The observed level of convergence was more frequent than expected under
   Brownian motion and single-optimum simulations, which illustrates that
   the results are likely not a result of stochastic evolution over long
   time periods. Nocturnal and cathemeral activity patterns were common
   among lineages in the arid climate niche. Conclusion Lemur climate niche
   evolution demonstrated that convergence explains the distribution of
   four independent clades in hot, arid environments of southwest
   Madagascar. The timing of these convergent shifts coincided with the
   origination of modern arid-adapted plant genera, some of which are
   important lemur food sources. These communities have high endemicity and
   are especially threatened by habitat loss. Arid environments are arenas
   in which convergent evolution is predicted to occur frequently.},

Title = {Anthropogenic pressures drive population genetic structuring across a
   Critically Endangered lemur species range},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {In recent decades Madagascar has experienced significant habitat loss
   and modification, with minimal understanding of how human land use
   practices have impacted the evolution of its flora and fauna. In light
   of ongoing and intensifying anthropogenic pressures, we seek new insight
   into mechanisms driving genetic variability on this island, using a
   Critically Endangered lemur species, the black-and-white ruffed lemur
   (Varecia variegata), as a test case. Here, we examine the relative
   influence of natural and anthropogenic landscape features that we
   predict will impose barriers to dispersal and promote genetic
   structuring across the species range. Using circuit theory, we model
   functional connectivity among 18 sampling localities using
   population-based genetic distance (FST). We optimized resistance
   surfaces using genetic algorithms and assessed their performance using
   maximum-likelihood population-effects mixed models. The best supported
   resistance model was a composite surface that included two anthropogenic
   features, habitat cover and distance to villages, suggesting that rapid
   land cover modification by humans has driven change in the genetic
   structure of wild lemurs. Primary conservation priority should be placed
   on mitigating further forest loss and connecting regions identified as
   having low dispersal potential to prevent further loss of genetic
   diversity and promote the survival of other moist forest specialists.},

Title = {Molecular edge effects in the Endangered golden-brown mouse lemur
   Microcebus ravelobensis},
Journal = {ORYX},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {53},
Number = {4},
Pages = {716-726},

Abstract = {Habitat fragmentation creates habitat edges, and ecological edge effects
   can cause major changes in the ecology and distribution of many taxa.
   However, these ecological changes may in turn influence animal movements
   and lead to molecular edge effects and edge-related genetic structure,
   matters that are largely unexplored. This study aims to infer molecular
   edge effects and to test three possible underlying mechanisms in the
   Endangered golden-brown mouse lemur Microcebus ravelobensis, a nocturnal
   species in the dry deciduous forest of the Ankarafantsika National Park
   in north-western Madagascar. Mouse lemurs were sampled in one edge and
   two interior habitats in close proximity to each other (500-1,400 m) in
   a continuous forest. A total of 41 mouse lemur samples were genotyped
   with seven nuclear microsatellites, and a fragment of the mitochondrial
   control region was sequenced for all samples. The overall genetic
   diversity (allelic richness, heterozygosity, haplotype richness,
   nucleotide diversity) was lower in the edge habitat compared to the two
   interior sites and all subpopulations showed signals of relatively low
   genetic exchange and significant genetic differentiation between them
   despite the short geographical distances, supporting the local
   preference model. These findings can be interpreted as preliminary
   signals of a molecular edge effect and suggest the potential for local
   adaptation. They are highly relevant for the conservation of fragmented
   populations, because a further subdivision of already small populations
   may increase their vulnerability to stochastic demographic changes and
   collapse.},

Title = {Organizational and activational androgens, lemur social play, and the
   ontogeny of female dominance},
Journal = {HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {115},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The role of androgens in shaping ``masculine{''} traits in males is a
   core focus in behavioral endocrinology, but relatively little is known
   about an androgenic role in female aggression and social dominance. In
   mammalian models of female dominance, including the ring-tailed lemur
   (Lemur catta), links to androgens in adulthood are variable. We studied
   the development of ring-tailed lemurs to address the behavioral basis
   and ontogenetic mechanisms of female dominance. We measured behavior and
   serum androgen concentrations in 24 lemurs (8 males, 16 females) from
   infancy to early adulthood, and assessed their `prenatal' androgen
   milieu using serum samples obtained from their mothers during gestation.
   Because logistical constraints limited the frequency of infant blood
   sampling, we accounted for asynchrony between behavioral and postnatal
   hormone measurements via imputation procedures. Imputation was
   unnecessary for prenatal hormone measurements. The typical sex
   difference in androgen concentrations in young lemurs was consistent
   with adult conspecifics and most other mammals; however, we found no
   significant sex differences in rough-and-tumble play. Female (but not
   male) aggression increased beginning at approximately 15 months,
   coincident with female puberty. In our analyses relating sexually
   differentiated behavior to androgens, we found no relationship with
   activational hormones, but several significant relationships with
   organizational hormones. Notably, associations of prenatal
   androstenedione and testosterone with behavior were differentiated, both
   by offspring sex and by type of behavior within offspring sexes. We
   discuss the importance of considering (1) missing data in behavioral
   endocrinology research, and (2) organizational androgens other than
   testosterone in studies of female dominance.},

Abstract = {Interspecific competition can strongly influence patterns of space use
   in animal communities, particularly between closely related species, and
   may be exacerbated in marginal habitat. This may be important in
   Madagascar, as lemurs face diminishing resources due to deforestation.
   We examined the range overlap and spatiotemporal relationships of three
   species of frugivorous lemur in the fragmented forests of Kianjavato,
   Madagascar. We conducted simultaneous location and behaviour sampling of
   black-and-white ruffed lemurs, Varecia variegata, red-fronted lemurs,
   Eulemur rufifrons, and red-bellied lemurs, Eulemur rubriventer, at two
   sites over a period of 11 months. We used Doncaster's index of dynamic
   interaction to investigate the relative amount of time species spent
   within 30 m and 100 m of each other, compared to the time expected based
   on random use of location points. All three species showed low core
   range overlap compared to home range overlap, and while core overlap was
   higher between interspecific groups than intraspecific groups, the
   difference was not substantial. Conversely, no spatiotemporal avoidance
   was observed, and red-fronted lemurs showed positive association
   (indicating possible attraction) with both red-bellied and ruffed
   lemurs. These positive spatiotemporal associations may be related to
   shared resource use in small forests, or predation avoidance strategies.
   At present, these species may rely more on spatial segregation and niche
   separation than spatiotemporal avoidance to minimize interspecific
   competition. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Title = {Genetic variation at MHC class II loci influences both olfactory signals
   and scent discrimination in ring-tailed lemurs},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Background Diversity at the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is
   critical to health and fitness, such that MHC genotype may predict an
   individual's quality or compatibility as a competitor, ally, or mate.
   Moreover, because MHC products can influence the components of bodily
   secretions, an individual's body odors may signal its MHC composition
   and influence partner identification or mate choice. Here, we
   investigated MHC-based signaling and recipient sensitivity by testing
   for odor-gene covariance and behavioral discrimination of MHC diversity
   and pairwise dissimilarity in a strepsirrhine primate, the ring-tailed
   lemur (Lemur catta). Methods First, we coupled genotyping of the MHC
   class II gene, DRB, with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of genital
   gland secretions to investigate if functional genetic diversity is
   signaled by the chemical diversity of lemur scent secretions. We also
   assessed if the chemical similarity between individuals correlated with
   their MHC-DRB similarity. Next, we assessed if lemurs discriminated this
   chemically encoded, genetic information in opposite-sex conspecifics.
   Results We found that both sexes signaled overall MHC-DRB diversity and
   pairwise MHC-DRB similarity via genital secretions, but in a sex- and
   season-dependent manner. Additionally, the sexes discriminated absolute
   and relative MHC-DRB diversity in the genital odors of opposite-sex
   conspecifics, suggesting that lemur genital odors function to advertise
   genetic quality. Conclusions In summary, genital odors of ring-tailed
   lemurs provide honest information about an individual's absolute and
   relative MHC quality. Complementing evidence in humans and Old World
   monkeys, we suggest that reliance on scent signals to communicate MHC
   quality may be important across the primate lineage.},

Abstract = {Lepilemur mittermeieri, a little-studied sportive lemur of north-west
   Madagascar, endemic to the Ampasindava Peninsula, faces habitat loss
   through forest degradation and rapid fragmentation. Understanding its
   habitat requirement is the first step toward preservation of this
   threatened forest-dependent species. In this study, we gathered data on
   the use of space and home range characteristics of L. mittermeieri. We
   studied individuals from early March to the end of June 2015 and 2016,
   in three sites of the Ampasindava peninsula. We radio-tracked 15
   individuals to obtain detailed information on the size and location of
   home ranges (around 450 hr of tracking). Direct observation and
   morphometric measurements provided additional data sets. Both kernel
   density estimation (KDE) and minimum convex polygon (MCP) methods
   yielded similar home range sizes (an average of 2.01 ha with KDE method
   and 1.96 ha with MCP method). We did not find differences in home range
   size between males and females, with respect to forest type or proximity
   to the forest edge. Home ranges overlapped and individuals showed low
   levels of territoriality. We highlighted a sexually-dimorphic trait:
   males have longer upper canine than females. Our results constitute the
   first set of ecological information on Lepilemur mittermeieri and could
   be the basis for a conservation strategy for this endangered species
   with a very small distribution area.},

Title = {Navigation strategies in three nocturnal lemur species: diet predicts
   heuristic use and degree of exploratory behavior},
Journal = {ANIMAL COGNITION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Humans generally solve multi-destination routes with simple
   rules-of-thumb. Animals may do the same, but strong evidence is limited
   to a few species. We examined whether strepsirrhines, who diverged from
   haplorhines more than 58 mya, would demonstrate the use of three
   heuristics used by humans and supported in vervets, the nearest neighbor
   rule, the convex hull, and a cluster strategy, when solving a
   multi-destination route. We hypothesized that the evolution of these
   strategies may depend on a species' dietary specialization. Three
   nocturnal lemur species were tested on an experimental array at the Duke
   Lemur Center. Frugivorous fat-tailed dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus medius)
   were expected to follow paths most consistent with distance-saving
   navigational heuristics because fruit trees are stationary targets. Gray
   mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) and aye-ayes (Daubentonia
   madagascariensis), which rely on more mobile and ephemeral foods, were
   expected to use fewer paths consistent with these heuristics and be more
   exploratory. Our data supported all of these hypotheses. Dwarf lemurs
   used paths consistent with all three heuristics, took the shortest
   paths, and were the least exploratory. Mouse lemurs were quite
   exploratory but sometimes used paths consistent with heuristics.
   Aye-ayes showed no evidence of heuristic use and were the most
   exploratory. Distinguishable patterns of inter- and intra-individual
   variation in ability to solve the route, speed, and behavior occurred in
   each species. This research suggests that these simple navigational
   heuristics are not part of a readily available set of cognitive tools
   inherited by all primates but instead evolve due to need in each
   lineage.},

Abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats to biodiversity
   worldwide. Madagascar is among the top biodiversity hotspots and in the
   past 100years several species became endangered on the island as a
   consequence of anthropogenic activities. In this study, we assessed the
   levels of genetic diversity and variation of a population of mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus tavaratra) inhabiting the degraded forests of the
   Loky-Manambato region (Northern Madagascar). We used a panel of 15
   microsatellite markers to genotype 149 individuals. Our aim was to
   understand if the elements contributing to the heterogeneity of the
   landscape, such as forest fragmentation, roads, rivers and open habitat,
   influence the genetic structure of this population. The results showed
   that geographic distance along with open habitat, vegetation type and,
   to some extent, the Manankolana River, seem to be the main factors
   responsible for M. tavaratra population structure in this region. We
   found that this species still maintains substantial levels of genetic
   diversity within each forest patch and at the overall population, with
   low genetic differentiation observed between patches. This seems to
   suggest that the still existing riparian forest network connecting the
   different forest patches in this region, facilitates dispersal and
   maintains high levels of gene flow. We highlight that special efforts
   targeting riparian forest maintenance and reforestation might be a good
   strategy to reduce the effect of habitat fragmentation on the genetic
   diversity of extant M. tavaratra populations.},

Abstract = {We used species-area relationships (SARs) to investigate the effects of
   habitat loss on lemur biogeography. We measured species richness via
   visual surveys on line transects within 42 fragments of dry deciduous
   forest at the Ambanjabe field site in Ankarafantsika National Park,
   Madagascar. We measured human disturbance and habitat characteristics
   within 38 of the 42 fragments. We measured the distance between each
   fragment and the nearest settlement, continuous forest, and nearest
   neighboring fragment. We fit 10 candidate SAR models to the data using
   nonlinear least squares regression and compared them using Akaike's
   Information Criterion (AIC). To determine how habitat characteristics,
   as well as area, influenced species richness, we ran a hierarchical
   partitioning procedure to select which variables to include in
   generalized additive models (GAMs) and compared them using AIC. Contrary
   to expectations, we found that lemurs form convex SARs, without a small
   island effect, and with the power model being the most likely SAR model.
   Although we found that four variables (area, survey effort, and total
   human disturbance, and mean tree height) independently contributed
   greater than 10\% of the variation in lemur species richness, only area
   was included in the most likely model. We suggest that the power model
   was the most likely SAR model and our inability to detect a small island
   effect are the result of Microcebus spp. being edge tolerant and capable
   of dispersing through matrix, scale issues in the study design, and low
   -diversity in the landscape. However, more study is needed to determine
   what role human disturbance plays in influencing species richness in
   lemurs.},

Abstract = {Long-term genetic monitoring of populations is essential for efforts
   aimed at preserving genetic diversity of endangered species. Here, we
   employ a framework of long-term genetic monitoring to evaluate the
   effects of fragmentation and the effectiveness of the establishment of
   corridors in restoring population connectivity and genetic diversity of
   mouse lemurs Microcebus ganzhorni. To this end, we supplement estimates
   of neutral genetic diversity with the assessment of adaptive genetic
   variability of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In addition,
   we address the challenges of long-term genetic monitoring of functional
   diversity by comparing the genotyping performance and estimates of MHC
   variability generated by single-stranded conformation polymorphism
   (SSCP)/Sanger sequencing with those obtained by high-throughput
   sequencing (next-generation sequencing {[}NGS], Illumina), an issue that
   is particularly relevant when previous work serves as a baseline for
   planning management strategies that aim to ensure the viability of a
   population. We report that SSCP greatly underestimates individual
   diversity and that discrepancies in estimates of MHC diversity
   attributable to the comparisons of traditional and NGS genotyping
   techniques can influence the conclusions drawn from conservation
   management scenarios. Evidence of migration among fragments in Mandena
   suggests that mouse lemurs are robust to the process of fragmentation
   and that the effect of corridors is masked by ongoing gene flow.
   Nonetheless, results based on a larger number of shared private alleles
   at neutral loci between fragment pairs found after the establishment of
   corridors in Mandena suggest that gene flow is augmented as a result of
   enhanced connectivity. Our data point out that despite low effective
   population size, M. ganzhorni maintains high individual heterozygosity
   at neutral loci and at MHC II DRB gene and that selection plays a
   predominant role in maintaining MHC diversity. These findings highlight
   the importance of long-term genetic monitoring in order to disentangle
   between the processes of drift and selection maintaining adaptive
   genetic diversity in small populations.},

Abstract = {Lemurs are highly endangered mammals inhabiting the forests of
   Madagascar. In this study, we performed virus discovery on serum samples
   collected from 84 wild lemurs and identified viral sequence fragments
   from 4 novel viruses within the family Flaviviridae, including members
   of the genera Hepacivirus and Pegivirus. The sifaka hepacivirus (SifHV,
   two genotypes) and pegivirus (SifPgV, two genotypes) were discovered in
   the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema), while other pegiviral
   fragments were detected in samples from the indri (Indri indri, IndPgV)
   and the weasel sportive lemur (Lepilemur mustelinus, LepPgV). Although
   data are preliminary, each viral species appeared host species-specific
   and frequent infection was detected (18 of 84 individuals were positive
   for at least one virus). The complete coding sequence and partial 5' and
   3' untranslated regions (UTRs) were obtained for SifHV and its genomic
   organization was consistent with that of other hepaciviruses, with one
   unique polyprotein and highly structured UTRs. Phylogenetic analyses
   showed the SifHV belonged to a clade that includes several viral species
   identified in rodents from Asia and North America, while SifPgV and
   IndPgV were more closely related to pegiviral species A and C, that
   include viruses found in humans as well as New- and Old-World monkeys.
   Our results support the current proposed model of virus-host
   co-divergence with frequent occurrence of cross-species transmission for
   these genera and highlight how the discovery of more members of the
   Flaviviridae can help clarify the ecology and evolutionary history of
   these viruses. Furthermore, this knowledge is important for conservation
   and captive management of lemurs.},

Title = {Sex differences in scent-marking in captive red-ruffed lemurs},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {81},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Primate chemical communication remains underappreciated, as primates are
   considered to rely on other sensory modalities. However, various lines
   of evidence suggest that olfaction plays an important role in primate
   societies, including the conspicuous scent-marking behavior of many
   strepsirrhines and callitrichines. Although lemurs typically show
   scent-marking, little is known about this behavior in red-ruffed lemurs
   (Varecia variegata rubra). We combined behavioral observations and
   semiochemistry analyses to improve our understanding of scent-marking in
   two captive troops housed at Dudley and Twycross zoos (UK). We collected
   olfactory behavioral observations by focusing on two family troops (N =
   7) for 132 hr. We investigated the volatile compounds of ano-genital
   scent-marks using solid-phase microextraction and gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry and compared volatile chemical profiles
   with features of the signaller. Males scent-marked most frequently and
   predominantly in specific meaningful areas of the enclosure, while
   within females the occurrence of scent-marking was related to their age.
   We found behavioral sexual dimorphism, with male predominantly
   depositing secretions via neck and mandible glands and females via
   ano-genital glands. We identified a total of 32 volatile components of
   ano-genital gland secretion, including compounds that have already been
   found in other mammals as sex pheromones and cues to fitness, in
   ano-genital scent-marks spontaneously left on filter paper by adult
   females. Our findings suggest that red-ruffed lemurs might use
   scent-marking to convey information about sex and female age, with male
   neck-marking behavior playing defensive territorial functions and
   ano-genital marking related to socio-sexual communication.},

Volume = {90},

Abstract = {Stereotypical vocalisations can facilitate long-distance communication
   in dense and, thus, sound-degrading forest habitats. Despite this,
   primate vocal repertoires often also include gradations between
   different call types that are used in social interactions. Because many
   nocturnal primates show a solitary social structure, it has been
   difficult to assess the role vocalisations play in mediating their
   social encounters. Here we aim to expand on the call types of Sahamalaza
   sportive lemurs, Lepilemur sahamalaza, as well as investigate their
   variability and use in social contexts. Through long-term behavioural
   observations with concurrent recording of vocalisations of known and
   unknown individuals between 2015 and 2016, we described three previously
   unrecorded calls and expanded the vocal repertoire to 12 different call
   types that were used in both targeted social and broadcast solitary
   contexts. Linear discriminant function and cluster analysis supported
   initial observations that vocalisations within call types were variable
   and that at least two call types can be classified as graded, contrary
   to expectations. Despite variations in call-context connections, no
   clear patterns of call use could be established. However, measurable
   differences in vocal behaviour between the seasons and the sexes
   indicate that calling is used in a reproductive context, similar to
   other nocturnal and diurnal primates. (c) 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {MicroRNA (miRNA) are endogenous small noncoding RNA gene products, on
   average 22 nt long, that play important regulatory roles in mediating
   gene expression by binding to and targeting mRNAs for degradation or
   translational repression. In this paper we identify both novel and
   conserved miRNA sequences present in the genome of the gray mouse lemur,
   Microcebus marinus. In total, 122 conserved and 44 novel miRNA were
   identified with high confidence from the lemur genome (Mmur\_2.0) and
   were used for expression analysis. All conserved and novel miRNA were
   subjected to relative quantification by RT-qPCR in liver samples from
   control and torpid lemurs. A total of 26 miRNA (16 conserved and 10
   novel) showed increased levels during primate torpor, whereas 31 (30
   conserved and 1 novel) decreased. Additional in silico mapping of the
   predicted mRNA targets of torpor-responsive mature miRNA suggested that
   miRNA that increased during torpor were collectively involved in cell
   development and survival pathways, while miRNA that decreased were
   enriched in targeting immune function. Overall, the study suggests new
   regulatory mechanisms of primate torpor via miRNA action.},

Abstract = {Self-anointing, referring to the behaviour of rubbing a material object
   or foreign substance over different parts of the body, has been observed
   in several vertebrate species, including primates. Several functions,
   such as detoxifying a rich food source, social communication and
   protection against ectoparasites, have been proposed to explain this
   behaviour. Here, we report observations of six wild red-fronted lemurs
   (Eulemur rufifrons) of both sexes and different age classes anointing
   their perianal-genital areas and tails with chewed millipedes. Several
   individuals also ingested millipedes after prolonged chewing. In light
   of the features of the observed interactions with millipedes, and the
   nature and potential metabolic pathways of the released chemicals, we
   suggest a potential self-medicative function. Specifically, we propose
   that anointing combined with the ingestion of millipedes' benzoquinone
   secretions by red-fronted lemurs may act in a complementary fashion
   against gastrointestinal parasite infections, and more specifically
   Oxyuridae nematodes, providing both prophylactic and therapeutic
   effects.},

Title = {Infant nest and stash sites of variegated lemurs (Varecia rubra): The
   extended phenotype},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {80},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Very few primate species give birth to litters and build nests in which
   to care for them. Those that do are small-bodied, nocturnal, and
   solitary. Variegated lemurs are exceptional in that they bear litters in
   arboreal nests, yet are relatively large-bodied, day-active, and
   gregarious. Furthermore, they raise their young cooperatively and
   practice absentee parenting; non-clinging young are transported orally
   and periodically stashed in arboreal spots that are supportive,
   sheltered, and usually concealed. Following birth, infant nest and stash
   trees were mapped, measured, and taxonomically identified in a
   population of red variegated lemurs in Masoala National Park. About 40
   trees were used per litter for nesting and stashing young in adjacent,
   non-overlapping core areas within the community. These were the largest
   trees in the forest, even larger than those used for feeding.
   Furthermore, most occur in valleys and are laced with lianas, creating
   sites that buffer young from predation, accidental falls, and to some
   degree, thermal stress. In combination, the number of nest and stash
   trees used per litter, their characteristics, and their geo-spatial
   arrangement indicate that such sites are both select and limited in the
   landscape, exposing the dependence of red variegated lemurs on intact
   forest canopies for raising non-clinging young within the context of an
   absentee parenting system. Nest and stash sites are in effect Varecia's
   extended phenotype. Logging of large trees in Madagascar's eastern rain
   forests is considered a major factor resulting in local extinctions of
   variegated lemurs because they rely heavily upon large, mature trees for
   fruit. However, this study suggests that removal of large trees may more
   directly precipitate local extinctions by impeding their ability to
   reproduce. Long-term survival of red variegated lemurs will depend upon
   efforts to end harmful timber extraction in its remaining stronghold,
   the Masoala Peninsula.},

Title = {Lemur species-specific metapopulation responses to habitat loss and

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {Determining what factors affect species occurrence is vital to the study
   of primate biogeography. We investigated the metapopulation dynamics of
   a lemur community consisting of eight species (Avahi occidentalis,
   Propithecus coquereli, Microcebus murinus, Microcebus ravelobensis,
   Lepilemur edwardsi, Cheirogaleus medius, Eulemur mongoz, and Eulemur
   fulvus) within fragmented tropical dry deciduous forest habitat in
   Ankarafantsika National Park, Madagascar. We measured fragment size and
   isolation of 42 fragments of forest ranging in size from 0.23 to 117.7
   ha adjacent to continuous forest. Between June and November 2011, we
   conducted 1218 surveys and observed six of eight lemur species (M.
   murinus, M. ravelobensis, C. medius, E. fulvus, P. coquereli, and L.
   edwardsi) in the 42 fragments. We applied among patch incidence function
   models (IFMs) with various measures of dispersal and a mainland-island
   IFM to lemur species occurrence, with the aim of answering the following
   questions: 1) Do lemur species in dry deciduous forest fragments form
   metapopulations? 2) What are the separate effects of area (extinction
   risk) and connectivity/isolation (colonization potential) within a lemur
   metapopulation? 3) Within simulated metapopulations over time, how do
   area and connectivity/isolation affect occurrence? and 4) What are the
   conservation implications of our findings? We found that M. murinus
   formed either a mainland-island or an among patch metapopulation, M.
   ravelobensis formed a mainland-island metapopulation, C. medius and E.
   fulvus formed among patch metapopulations, and neither P. coquereli or
   L. edwardsi formed a metapopulation. Metapopulation dynamics and
   simulations suggest that area was a more consistent positive factor
   determining lemur species occurrence than fragment isolation and is
   crucial to the maintenance of lemur populations within this fragmented
   landscape. Using a metapopulation approach to lemur biogeography is
   critical for understanding how lemur species respond to forest loss and
   fragmentation.},

Title = {Behavioral responses of three lemur species to different food enrichment
   devices},
Journal = {ZOO BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {146-155},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Environmental enrichment is a tool used to promote the welfare and
   well-being of captive animals by encouraging the display of
   species-specific behaviors and reducing the stress or boredom induced by
   captive environments. Lemurs are highly endangered, yet few studies have
   analyzed the behavioral impacts of enrichment on captive populations. We
   studied the impacts of two novel enrichment devices on three lemur
   species (ring-tailed lemurs {[}Lemur catta], red-ruffed lemurs
   {[}Varecia rubra], and Coquerel's sifaka {[}Propithecus coquereli]) to
   determine both the overall and species-specific impacts of enrichment on
   lemur behavior. We recorded lemur behavior using the continuous sampling
   method to obtain behavior duration and analyzed our results using ANOVA
   Repeated Measures. Results showed enrichment effectiveness differed for
   each species and that different enrichment devices had varying impacts
   on lemur behavior across all species. We attributed the differences in
   species-specific responses to the unique locomotor patterns and methods
   of diet acquisition of each species, and the variances in behavioral
   responses across all species to the characteristics of each device. Our
   study highlights the importance of species-specific enrichment and
   encourages further research in this field in order to maximize the
   positive effects of enrichment, which in turn has the potential to
   affect the overall well-being of captive populations.},

Title = {Knowledgeable Lemurs Become More Central in Social Networks},
Journal = {CURRENT BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1306+},
Month = {APR 23},
Abstract = {Strong relationships exist between social connections and information
   transmission {[}1-9], where individuals' network position plays a key
   role in whether or not they acquire novel information {[}2, 3, 5, 6].
   The relationships between social connections and information acquisition
   may be bidirectional if learning novel information, in addition to being
   influenced by it, influences network position. Individuals who acquire
   information quickly and use it frequently may receive more affiliative
   behaviors {[}10, 11] and may thus have a central network position.
   However, the potential influence of learning on network centrality has
   not been theoretically or empirically addressed. To bridge this
   epistemic gap, we investigated whether ring-tailed lemurs' (Lemur catta)
   centrality in affiliation networks changed after they learned how to
   solve a novel foraging task. Lemurs who had frequently initiated
   interactions and approached conspecifics before the learning experiment
   were more likely to observe and learn the task solution. Comparing
   social networks before and after the learning experiment revealed that
   the frequently observed lemurs received more affiliative behaviors than
   they did before-they became more central after the experiment. This
   change persisted even after the task was removed and was not caused by
   the observed lemurs initiating more affiliative behaviors. Consequently,
   quantifying received and initiated interactions separately provides
   unique insights into the relationships between learning and centrality.
   While the factors that influence network position are not fully
   understood, our results suggest that individual differences in learning
   and becoming successful can play a major role in social centrality,
   especially when learning from others is advantageous.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the pattern of adult neurogenesis throughout the
   brains of three prosimian primate species using immunohistochemical
   techniques for endogenous markers of this neural process. Two species,
   Galago demidoff and Perodicticus potto, were obtained from wild
   populations in the primary rainforest of central Africa, while one
   species, Lemur catta, was captive-bred. Two brains from each species,
   perfusion-fixed with 4\% paraformaldehyde, were sectioned (50 mu m
   section thickness) in sagittal and coronal planes. Using Ki-67 and
   doublecortin (DCX) antibodies, proliferating cells and immature neurons
   were identified in the two canonical neurogenic sites of mammals, the
   subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle (SVZ) giving rise to the
   rostral migratory stream (RMS), and the subgranular zone of the dentate
   gyrus of the hippocampus. In addition a temporal migratory stream (TMS),
   emerging from the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle to supply the
   piriform cortex and adjacent brain regions with new neurons, was also
   evident in the three prosimian species. While no Ki67-immunoreactive
   cells were observed in the cerebellum, DCX-immunopositive cells were
   observed in the cerebellar cortex of all three species. These findings
   are discussed in a phylogenetic context. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by

Abstract = {Hibernation is an adaptive strategy some mammals use to survive highly
   seasonal or unpredictable environments. We present the first
   investigation on the transcriptomics of hibernation in a natural
   population of primate hibernators: Crossley's dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus
   crossleyi). Using capture-mark-recapture techniques to track the same
   animals over a period of 7 months in Madagascar, we used RNA-seq to
   compare gene expression profiles in white adipose tissue (WAT) during
   three distinct physiological states. We focus on pathway analysis to
   assess the biological significance of transcriptional changes in dwarf
   lemur WAT and, by comparing and contrasting what is known in other model
   hibernating species, contribute to a broader understanding of genomic
   contributions of hibernation across Mammalia. The hibernation signature
   is characterized by a suppression of lipid biosynthesis, pyruvate
   metabolism and mitochondrial-associated functions, and an accumulation
   of transcripts encoding ribosomal components and iron-storage proteins.
   The data support a key role of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4
   (PDK4) in regulating the shift in fuel economy during periods of severe
   food deprivation. This pattern of PDK4 holds true across representative
   hibernating species from disparate mammalian groups, suggesting that the
   genetic underpinnings of hibernation may be ancestral to mammals.},

Abstract = {The reproductive cycle of several lemur species is synchronized by
   photoperiodic changes and it is attuned to the seasonal fluctuations in
   food supply. Nevertheless, irregular periods of food shortage occur in
   Madagascar, which can result in a negative energy balance and reduced
   fitness, especially in frugivorous species. Here, we tested whether
   ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) and brown lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons x
   collaris) use fat stores to maintain their energy balance in a gallery
   forest of Madagascar (Berenty Reserve). We assessed the energy intake
   from weight-based estimates of food intake (mouthful count) and
   macronutrient contents in the diet during dry and wet months. The
   metabolizable energy ingested by these frugivorous/folivorous species
   was high during the late wet season, but it was insufficient to meet
   their energy requirements during the dry season. These preliminary data
   suggest that these lemurs must store sufficient amount of fat mass
   during the period of food abundance to meet their maintenance
   requirements and to cope with the energetic burden of the mating season.
   Estimates based on models assuming no fiber digestibility during the dry
   season are consistent with the prediction that brown lemurs should
   supplement their daytime diet with nighttime feeding in addition to the
   use of body fat stores.},

Abstract = {Prehension is essential for animal survival and fitness. It is involved
   in locomotion and feeding behavior and subject to physical and
   physiological constraints. Studies of prehension in primates have
   explored the importance of food properties and of the environment, but
   aging has rarely been studied although prehensile capacity may
   deteriorate with age in humans. To test the hypothesis that aging
   affects grasping abilities and to reveal possible behavioral adaptations
   to this, we quantified behavioral grasping strategies and pull strength
   in 10 young adult (2-3 yr old) and 10 aged (7-8 yr old) gray mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus murinus). We assessed grasping strategies in an
   experimental cage by quantifying grip types used to grasp static and
   mobile foods. We measured strength using a Kistler triaxial force
   platform. Our results show that 1) mobile and static foods affected
   individuals of different ages in similar ways; 2) older individuals used
   more mouth grasps than young ones; 3) aged individuals made twice as
   many attempts as young ones when grasping mobile food items but this
   difference was not significant; and 4) there were no differences in hand
   grip strength between age classes but young individuals showed a higher
   foot pull strength compared to old ones. These data suggest that the
   observed differences in behavior may be due to a decrease in foot grip
   strength, which in turn influences stability on narrow branches, forcing
   animals to use their hands to maintain stability and preventing them
   from using their hands for food-related tasks.},

Title = {``Stink flirting{''} in ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta): Male olfactory
   displays to females as honest, costly signals},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {79},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Sexual selection for honest behavioral displays of quality has driven
   the development of remarkably complex courtship behavior in many animal
   species. Olfactory displays are often overlooked as an area of inquiry
   compared to auditory and visual displays. Ring-tailed lemur (Lemur
   catta) scent marking of substrates has been studied extensively,
   although the male olfactory displays of anointing and wafting tails to
   females has received relatively little attention. We studied the role of
   male olfactory displays to females, evaluating whether such signals
   function as honest, costly signals of male dominance status in two
   groups of wild L. catta at Berenty Reserve, Madagascar. Our results
   suggest that male tail anointing and tail wafting displays to
   pre-estrous and estrous females are correlated with male dominance rank,
   and moreover appear to operate as costly signals, as such displays
   increase aggression received from males and females while other types of
   scent marking do not. Furthermore, females showed greater mating
   preference (as measured by sexual presents) for resident males who
   performed the ``anoint tail{''} and ``waft tail{''} displays towards
   them. When males perform the ``anoint tail{''} and ``waft tail{''}
   displays to females, they receive higher levels of aggression than if
   they were to perform other types of scent marking. Interestingly,
   immigrating (peripheral) males performed the ``anoint tail{''} and
   ``waft tail{''} displays at higher rates than resident males, which
   could honestly indicate their quality or may simply be associated with
   the alternative mating strategy of transferring between groups to gain
   mating opportunities. Our finding that tail anointing and tail wafting
   displays function as honest signals of dominance for resident males-and
   that these costly displays appear to positively affect female mate
   choice-is the first evidence of this function for this particular
   olfactory signal in L. catta.},

Title = {Hybrid de novo genome assembly and centromere characterization of the
   gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus)},
Journal = {BMC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Background: The de novo assembly of repeat-rich mammalian genomes using
   only high-throughput short read sequencing data typically results in
   highly fragmented genome assemblies that limit downstream applications.
   Here, we present an iterative approach to hybrid de novo genome assembly
   that incorporates datasets stemming from multiple genomic technologies
   and methods. We used this approach to improve the gray mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus) genome from early draft status to a near
   chromosome-scale assembly.
   Methods: We used a combination of advanced genomic technologies to
   iteratively resolve conflicts and super-scaffold the M. murinus genome.
   Results: We improved the M. murinus genome assembly to a scaffold N50 of
   93.32 Mb. Whole genome alignments between our primary super-scaffolds
   and 23 human chromosomes revealed patterns that are congruent with
   historical comparative cytogenetic data, thus demonstrating the accuracy
   of our de novo scaffolding approach and allowing assignment of scaffolds
   to M. murinus chromosomes. Moreover, we utilized our independent
   datasets to discover and characterize sequences associated with
   centromeres across the mouse lemur genome. Quality assessment of the
   final assembly found 96\% of mouse lemur canonical transcripts nearly
   complete, comparable to other published high-quality reference genome
   assemblies.
   Conclusions: We describe a new assembly of the gray mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus) genome with chromosome-scale scaffolds produced
   using a hybrid bioinformatic and sequencing approach. The approach is
   cost effective and produces superior results based on metrics of
   contiguity and completeness. Our results show that emerging genomic
   technologies can be used in combination to characterize centromeres of
   non-model species and to produce accurate de novo chromosome-scale
   genome assemblies of complex mammalian genomes.},

   large primate radiation may shed light on convergences and divergences
   in this context. We therefore compiled published social and ecological
   data and analyzed facial photographs of 65 lemur species to categorize
   variation in hair length, hair and skin coloration as well as color
   brightness. Phylogenetically controlled analyses revealed that group
   size and the number of sympatric species did not influence the evolution
   of facial color complexity in lemurs. Climatic factors, however,
   influenced facial color complexity, pigmentation and hair length in a
   few facial regions. Hair length in two facial regions was also
   correlated with group size and may facilitate individual recognition.
   Since phylogenetic signals were moderate to high for most models,
   genetic drift may have also played a role in the evolution of facial
   color patterns of lemurs. In conclusion, social factors seem to have
   played only a subordinate role in the evolution of facial color
   complexity in lemurs, and, more generally, group size appears to have no
   systematic functional effect on facial color complexity across all
   primates.},

Abstract = {Plants producing toxic plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) deter
   folivores from feeding on them. Animals that can cope with noxious PSMs
   have a niche with a competitive advantage over other species. However,
   the ability to cope with toxic PSMs incurs the costs of detoxification.
   To assess possible compensations for the ingestion of toxic PSMs, we
   compare the chemical quality of plants consumed by bamboo lemurs (genera
   Hapalemur and Prolemur; strepsirrhine primates of Madagascar) in areas
   with and without bamboo. Some bamboo lemurs consume bamboo containing
   concentrations of cyanogenic substances 10-50 times above the average
   lethal dosage for mammals, and we postulate that animals consuming
   cyanogenic substances need supplementary protein or readily available
   energy for detoxification. We compared the chemical composition of food
   consumed by three species of bamboo lemurs that feed mainly (>80\% of
   their time) on bamboo in the evergreen rainforest of Ranomafana
   (Madagascar) with published data of the diets of bamboo lemurs at two
   sites without highly cyanogenic plants (reed beds of Lac Alaotra and the
   evergreen littoral forest of Mandena) and with food of sympatric
   folivorous lemur species that do not feed on bamboo. Lemurs feeding on
   bamboo consumed up to twice as much protein as bamboo lemurs in areas
   without bamboo and sympatric lemur species that feed on leaves of trees.
   Concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates (a source of energy)
   showed the opposite trend. This result supports the hypothesis that
   feeding on cyanogenic plants is linked to high protein intake, either as
   a source of protein or for sulfur-containing amino acids that can be
   used for detoxification. Owing to the high protein concentrations in
   bamboo, however, we cannot distinguish between the hypothesis that
   lemurs that eat bamboo target additional food items with higher protein
   from the hypothesis that lemurs feeding on bamboo unavoidably obtain
   higher concentrations of protein than animals feeding on leaves of
   trees, without an added nutritional benefit.},

Title = {Genetic wealth, population health: Major histocompatibility complex
   variation in captive and wild ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Across species, diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
   is critical to individual disease resistance and, hence, to population
   health; however, MHC diversity can be reduced in small, fragmented, or
   isolated populations. Given the need for comparative studies of
   functional genetic diversity, we investigated whether MHC diversity
   differs between populations which are open, that is experiencing gene
   flow, versus populations which are closed, that is isolated from other
   populations. Using the endangered ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) as a
   model, we compared two populations under long-term study: a relatively
   ``open,{''} wild population (n=180) derived from Beza Mahafaly Special
   Reserve, Madagascar (2003-2013) and a ``closed,{''} captive population
   (n=121) derived from the Duke Lemur Center (DLC, 1980-2013) and from the
   Indianapolis and Cincinnati Zoos (2012). For all animals, we assessed
   MHC-DRB diversity and, across populations, we compared the number of
   unique MHC-DRB alleles and their distributions. Wild individuals
   possessed more MHC-DRB alleles than did captive individuals, and
   overall, the wild population had more unique MHC-DRB alleles that were
   more evenly distributed than did the captive population. Despite
   management efforts to maintain or increase genetic diversity in the DLC
   population, MHC diversity remained static from 1980 to 2010. Since 2010,
   however, captive-breeding efforts resulted in the MHC diversity of
   offspring increasing to a level commensurate with that found in wild
   individuals. Therefore, loss of genetic diversity in lemurs, owing to
   small founder populations or reduced gene flow, can be mitigated by
   managed breeding efforts. Quantifying MHC diversity within individuals
   and between populations is the necessary first step to identifying
   potential improvements to captive management and conservation plans.},

Title = {Shared evolutionary origin of major histocompatibility complex

Abstract = {Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a central role
   in adaptive immune responses of vertebrates. They exhibit remarkable
   polymorphism, often crossing species boundaries with similar alleles or
   allelic motifs shared across species. This pattern may reflect parallel
   parasite-mediated selective pressures, either favouring the long
   maintenance of ancestral MHC allelic lineages across successive
   speciation events by balancing selection ({''}trans-species
   polymorphism{''}), or alternatively favouring the independent emergence
   of functionally similar alleles post-speciation via convergent
   evolution. Here, we investigate the origins of MHC similarity across
   several species of dwarf and mouse lemurs (Cheirogaleidae). We examined
   MHC class II variation in two highly polymorphic loci (DRB, DQB) and
   evaluated the overlap of gut-parasite communities in four sympatric
   lemurs. We tested for parasite-MHC associations across species to
   determine whether similar parasite pressures may select for similar MHC
   alleles in different species. Next, we integrated our MHC data with
   those previously obtained from other Cheirogaleidae to investigate the
   relative contribution of convergent evolution and co-ancestry to shared
   MHC polymorphism by contrasting patterns of codon usage at functional
   vs. neutral sites. Our results indicate that parasites shared across
   species may select for functionally similar MHC alleles, implying that
   the dynamics of MHC-parasite co-evolution should be envisaged at the
   community level. We further show that balancing selection maintaining
   trans-species polymorphism, rather than convergent evolution, is the
   primary mechanism explaining shared MHC sequence motifs between species
   that diverged up to 30 million years ago.},

Abstract = {Objectives: The Endangered collared brown lemur (Eulemur collaris) is
   the largest primate living in the littoral forest of southeastern
   Madagascar, a top priority habitat for biodiversity conservation on the
   island. Because this lemur is a key seed-disperser, an evaluation of the
   structure and connectivity of the populations surviving in the forest
   fragments is urgently needed to guide conservation plans.
   Materials and Methods: Genetic variability at autosomal microsatellites
   and mitochondrial DNA was investigated in a total of 49 collared brown
   lemurs sampled by non-invasive methods in three littoral forest
   fragments and in the nearby lowland humid forest.
   Results: The overall genetic diversity of E. collaris in the
   southeastern coastal region of Madagascar was lower than in other
   populations, as well as in other lemur species. The population appears
   highly structured, with less variable and more inbred groups inhabiting
   the littoral forest fragments compared to the inland area. Major
   barriers to gene flow were identified isolating littoral forest
   fragments from each other and from the inland lowland humid forest.
   Discussion: Medium to long-term drift and scarce gene flow is the
   scenario that best explains the current genetic distribution. Habitat
   discontinuities such as rivers and grassland between forest fragments
   played a major role in structuring the population. A common history of
   size contraction is pointed out by several genetic estimators,
   indicating a possible ecological crisis triggered around 1,300 years
   ago. The adoption of strategies aimed at facilitating gene flow and
   population growth appears crucial to delay further loss of genetic
   diversity.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to determine the minimum alveolar
   concentration (MAC) and cardiopulmonary effects of isoflurane in
   ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). The MAC of isoflurane was determined
   by using a tail-clamp stimulus in adult ring-tailed lemurs (6 male, 4
   female). Once MAC was determined, another group of 10 adult ring-tailed
   lemurs (5 male, 5 female) were anesthetized and instrumented similarly
   as the previous group and maintained at 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 times MAC for
   15 min each with no external stimulation. Five lemurs were exposed to
   increasing concentrations (that is, 0.5 times MAC increasing to 2 times
   MAC), and the other 5 animals were exposed to decreasing concentrations.
   MAC of isoflurane for ring-tailed lemurs was 1.9\%. The animals became
   hypotensive, but no significant differences were found in heart rate or
   systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressures at the different multiples
   of MAC examined. At 1 MAC, all lemurs developed a moderate respiratory
   acidosis, which became more severe at 2 MAC. Given these findings,
   isoflurane at 0.5 to 2 times MAC in ring-tailed lemurs does not result
   in predictable depression of blood pressure, but hypoventilation occurs
   at 1 MAC or greater.},

Title = {Activity patterns in seven captive lemur species: Evidence of
   cathemerality in Varecia and Lemur catta?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {79},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Cathemerality, or activity throughout the 24-hr cycle, is rare in
   primates yet relatively common among lemurs. However, the diverse
   ecological conditions under which cathemerality is expressed complicates
   attempts to identify species-typical behavior. For example, Lemur catta
   and Varecia have historically been described as diurnal, yet recent
   studies suggest that they might exhibit cathemeral behavior under some
   conditions. To investigate this variation, we monitored activity
   patterns among lemurs that are exposed to similar captive environments.
   Using MotionWatch 8 (R) actigraphy data loggers, we studied 88 lemurs
   across seven species at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC). Six species were
   members of the family Lemuridae (Eulemur coronatus, E. flavifrons, E.
   mongoz, L. catta, V. rubra, V. variegata), while a seventh was strictly
   diurnal and included as an out-group (Propithecus coquereli). For each
   24-hr cycle (N = 503), we generated two estimates of cathemerality: mean
   night (MN) activity and day/night (DN) activity ratio (day and night
   cutoffs were based on astronomical twilights). As expected, P. coquereli
   engaged in the least amount of nocturnal activity according to both
   measures; their activity was also outside the 95\% confidence intervals
   of all three cathemeral Eulemur species, which exhibited the greatest
   evidence of cathemerality. By these estimates, Varecia activity was most
   similar to Eulemur and exhibited substantial deviations from P.
   coquereli (beta (MN) = 0.22 +/- SE 0.12; beta (DN) = -0.21 +/- SE 0.12).
   L. catta activity patterns also deviated from P. coquereli (beta (MN) =
   0.12 +/- SE 0.11; beta (DN) = -0.15 +/- SE 0.12) but to a lesser degree
   than either Varecia or Eulemur. Overall, L. catta displayed an
   intermediate activity pattern between Eulemur and P. coquereli, which is
   somewhat consistent with wild studies. Regarding Varecia, although
   additional observations in more diverse wild habitats are needed, our
   findings support the existence of cathemeral behavior in this genus.},

Title = {Characterisation of urinary WFDC12 in small nocturnal basal primates,
   mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.)},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {Mouse lemurs are basal primates that rely on chemo-and acoustic
   signalling for social interactions in their dispersed social systems. We
   examined the urinary protein content of two mouse lemurs species, within
   and outside the breeding season, to assess candidates used in species
   discrimination, reproductive or competitive communication. Urine from
   Microcebus murinus and Microcebus lehilahytsara contain a predominant 10
   kDa protein, expressed in both species by some, but not all, males
   during the breeding season, but at very low levels by females. Mass
   spectrometry of the intact proteins confirmed the protein mass and
   revealed a 30 Da mass difference between proteins from the two species.
   Tandem mass spectrometry after digestion with three proteases and
   sequencing de novo defined the complete protein sequence and located an
   Ala/Thr difference between the two species that explained the 30 Da mass
   difference. The protein (mature form: 87 amino acids) is an atypical
   member of the whey acidic protein family (WFDC12). Seasonal excretion of
   this protein, species difference and male-specific expression during the
   breeding season suggest that it may have a function in intra-and/or
   intersexual chemical signalling in the context of reproduction, and
   could be a cue for sexual selection and species recognition.},

Title = {Relationships between steroid hormones in hair and social behaviour in
   ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)},
Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {199-209},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Relationships between the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal and
   hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal axes and social behaviour in primates are
   complex. By using hair to quantify steroid hormones, one can obtain
   retrospective estimates of long-term free hormone levels from a single
   sample. In this study, hair was used to quantify long-term levels of
   cortisol, testosterone, and estradiol among members of a colony of
   ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) to explore associations between intra-
   and intersexual levels of these hormones and social behaviour between
   the breeding and birthing seasons. Positive trends between hair cortisol
   and rates of receiving aggression approached significance for males and
   females after controlling for age. While there was no relationship
   between sex steroid concentrations and intrasexual social interactions,
   high rates of aggression in females over the study period coincided with
   females exhibiting the same average concentrations of testosterone as
   males. We, therefore, conclude that being the recipient of aggression
   might be more stressful than being aggressive in ring-tailed lemurs, and
   that testosterone potentially mediates female dominance in this species.
   We suggest that further investigation of hair hormones and behaviour in
   additional primate species could provide a useful comparative framework
   to guide interpretation of these novel findings.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Population decline and fragmentation often lead to reduced genetic
   diversity and population differentiation. Habitat destruction throughout
   Madagascar has caused population decline and extinction of many endemic
   species. Lemur populations, including those of the largest extant lemur,
   Indri indri, have been fragmented into remaining forest patches. We
   assessed the level of genetic diversity in indri populations in three
   protected reserves by genotyping a total of 43 individuals at 17
   microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity in terms of heterozygosity was
   high in all three reserves, with no differences between reserves.
   Population structure and F (ST) analyses revealed Analamazaotra Forest
   Station and the Torotorofotsy Conservation Area, which are separated by
   ca. 18 km to be genetically differentiated from each other with some
   admixture. Betampona Strict Nature Reserve, which is separated from the
   other reserves by ca. 130 km, exhibited clear population genetic
   differentiation, with no signs of admixture with the other reserves. Our
   genetic diversity estimates are similar to those for other Indridae in
   similar habitats and may reflect past rather than current population
   processes, given that populations have declined recently. Our results
   suggest that Betampona may be genetically isolated and that it is
   important to maintain gene flow between remaining populations to prevent
   loss of genetic diversity for the future conservation of Indri indri.},

Abstract = {The nasal cavity of strepsirrhine primates (lemurs and lorises) has the
   most primitive arrangement of extant primates. In nocturnal species, the
   numerous turbinals of the ethmoid bear a large surface area of olfactory
   mucosa (OM). In this study, we examine turbinal development in four
   genera of diurnal or cathemeral lemuriformes. In addition, we examined
   an age series of each genus to detect whether structures bearing OM as
   opposed to respiratory mucosa (RM) develop differently, as has been
   observed in nocturnal strepsirrhines. In adults, the maxilloturbinal is
   covered by highly vascular respiratory mucosa throughout its entire
   length, with large sinusoidal vessels in the lamina propria; any parts
   of other turbinals that closely borders the maxilloturbinal has a
   similar mucosa. Posteriorly, the most vascular RM is restricted in the
   nasopharyngeal duct, which becomes partitioned from the dorsal olfactory
   region. A comparison of newborns to adults reveals that the first
   ethmoturbinal increases more in length in the parts that are covered
   with RM than OM, which supports the idea that ethmoturbinals can
   specialize in more than one function. Finally, we observe that the
   regions of turbinals that are ultimately covered with RM develop more
   accessory lamellae or additional surface area of existing scrolls
   compared to the regions covered with OM. Because such outgrowths of bone
   develop postnatally and without cartilaginous precursors, we hypothesize
   that the complexity of olfactory lamellae within the ethmoturbinal
   complex is primarily established at birth, while respiratory lamellae
   become elaborated due to the epigenetic influence of respiratory
   physiology. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Paleontological and neontological systematics seek to answer
   evolutionary questions with different data sets. Phylogenies inferred
   for combined extant and extinct taxa provide novel insights into the
   evolutionary history of life. Primates have an extensive, diverse fossil
   record and molecular data for living and extinct taxa are rapidly
   becoming available. We used two models to infer the phylogeny and
   divergence times for living and fossil primates, the tip-dating (TD) and
   fossilized birth-death process (FBD). We collected new morphological
   data, especially on the living and extinct endemic lemurs of Madagascar.
   We combined the morphological data with published DNA sequences to infer
   near-complete (88\% of lemurs) time-calibrated phylogenies. The results
   suggest that primates originated around the Cretaceous-Tertiary
   boundary, slightly earlier than indicated by the fossil record and later
   than previously inferred from molecular data alone. We infer novel
   relationships among extinct lemurs, and strong support for relationships
   that were previously unresolved. Dates inferred with TD were
   significantly older than those inferred with FBD, most likely related to
   an assumption of a uniform branching process in the TD compared with a
   birth-death process assumed in the FBD. This is the first study to
   combine morphological and DNA sequence data from extinct and extant
   primates to infer evolutionary relationships and divergence times, and
   our results shed new light on the tempo of lemur evolution and the
   efficacy of combined phylogenetic analyses.},

Title = {Mechanical food properties and dental topography differentiate three

Abstract = {Determining the proximate causes of tooth wear remains a major focus of
   dental study. Here we compare the diets of three ring-tailed lemur
   (Lemur catta) populations and examine how different dietary components
   may contribute to patterns of wear-related tooth shape. Casts were made
   from dental impressions collected between 2003 and 2010 from lemurs in
   the gallery and spiny/mixed forests of the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve
   (BMSR; Parcels 1 and 2) and the spiny/mixed forests of Tsimanampesotse
   National Park (TNP), Madagascar. Tooth shape variables (occlusal relief
   and slope, angularity) were analyzed using dental topographic analysis.
   Focal observations and food mechanical properties (FMPs: toughness,
   hardness, elastic modulus) were conducted and tested, respectively,
   during wet and dry seasons from 2008 to 2012. We found that FMPs
   correlate with patterns of dental topography in these three populations.
   Specifically, food toughness and elastic modulus correlate with the
   dental variables, but hardness does not. Average food toughness and
   elastic modulus, but not hardness, are highest in BMSR Parcel 2,
   followed by BMSR Parcel 1 and TNP. Occlusal relief and slope, which
   serve as proxies for tooth wear, show the greatest wear in Parcel 2 and
   the least in TNP. Angularity is also more pronounced in TNP. Further,
   dental topographic patterns correspond to reliance on Tamarindus indica
   (tamarind) fruit. Both BMSR populations consume tamarind at high
   frequencies in the dry season, but the fruits are rare at TNP and only
   occasionally consumed. Thus, high seasonal tamarind consumption and its
   mechanical values help explain the low dental relief and slope among
   BMSR lemurs. By investigating the ecology of a single widespread species
   across a variety of habitats, we have been able to link specific
   components of diet to patterns of dental topography in this species.
   This provides a context for interpreting wear-related tooth shape
   changes more generally, illustrating that populations can develop
   different dental wear patterns resulting from a mix of intrinsic factors
   (thin enamel) and local conditions (food properties, frequency of
   consumption). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We recorded vocalisations of wild Eulemur mongoz groups in Madagascar
   and the Comoros Islands, as well as from habituated captive groups
   housed in European and Madagascan zoos. Each vocalisation was
   quantitatively described by means of an acoustic analysis procedure
   implemented in Praat, and vocal types were distinguished both by ear and
   by the visual screening of spectrograms. Vocal signals were then
   associated with the context in which they were produced, to explore
   whether they occur only in specific behavioural contexts or are uttered
   in a range of situations. We found that mongoose lemurs possess highly
   context-specific aerial alarm calls and territorial calls, while the
   `croui-croui' is usually emitted to communicate between individuals
   regrouping at sunset. The other calls we recorded, such as those
   including low-pitched pulse trains sometimes followed by harmonic
   elements, were not tightly associated with a particular context.
   Mongoose lemur utterances included calls produced with closed mouths and
   the involvement of nasal resonance, or with constant degrees of mouth
   opening or mandible `articulation' during phonation. We observed 15
   vocal types, nine of which were entered into a multivariate model that
   classified vocal types with a high degree of reliability. The second and
   third formants played an important role in discriminating among types of
   calls.},

Abstract = {Overexploitation is a significant threat to biodiversity, with live
   capture of millions of animals annually. An improved understanding of
   live capture of primates is needed, especially for Madagascar's
   threatened lemurs. Our objectives were to provide the first quantitative
   estimates of the prevalence, spatial extent, correlates and timing of
   lemur ownership, procurement methods, within-country movements, and
   numbers and duration of ownership. Using semi-structured interviews of
   1,093 households and 61 transporters, across 17 study sites, we found
   that lemur ownership was widespread and affected a variety of taxa. We
   estimate that 28,253 lemurs have been affected since 2010. Most lemurs
   were caught by owners and kept for either short (<= 1 week) or long (>=
   3 years) periods. The live capture of lemurs in Madagascar is not highly
   organized but may threaten several Endangered and Critically Endangered
   species.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {69-88},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Endogenous selection is often implicated in the maintenance of stability
   of natural hybrid zones. Environmental conditions often vary across
   these zones, suggesting that local adaptation to ecological conditions
   could also play a role in this process. We used niche modeling to
   investigate these alternatives in a hybrid zone between two species of
   brown lemur (Eulemur rufifrons and E. cinereiceps) in southeastern
   Madagascar. We produced ecological niche models (ENMs) for parental and
   hybrid populations and compared values of niche overlap to null
   expectations using identity and background tests. All three taxonomic
   groups had nonequivalent ENMs with limited spatial overlap, supporting a
   role for niche divergence and local adaptation in the maintenance of
   this zone. However, values of niche overlap between ENMs were not
   greater than null expectations controlling for background environmental
   differences. These results could suggest that taxa in this hybrid zone
   inhabit portions of their environments that are more similar to their
   backgrounds, i.e., niche conservatism. Nevertheless, we did find
   evidence of niche divergence when using background tests that examined
   environmental variables separately. Although we could not rule out
   models indicating selection against hybrids, most lines of evidence were
   consistent with predictions for the bounded superiority model of hybrid
   zone stability. This study thus provides support that exogenous,
   environmental selection may be responsible for maintaining the hybrid
   zone, and may be implicated in the evolutionary divergence of these
   taxa.},

Title = {The Season for Peace: Reconciliation in a Despotic Species (Lemur catta)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {However despotic a social group may be, managing conflicts of interest
   is crucial to preserve group living benefits, mainly based on
   cooperation. In despotic groups, post-conflict management via
   reconciliation (the first post-conflict reunion between former
   opponents) can occur, even if conciliatory rates are considerably
   different. Lemur catta is defined as a despotic species because groups
   are characterized by a strict linear hierarchy maintained by the adult
   females (the dominant sex) mainly via aggression. Reconciliation was
   reported in one out of four captive groups of L. catta. Here we
   investigate which variables influence the occurrence of reconciliation
   in these despotic groups. We analyzed 2339 Post Conflict (PC)-Matched
   Control (MC) observation pairs, collected on eight groups (five in the
   Berenty forest, Madagascar; three hosted at the Pistoia Zoo, Italy).
   Since L. catta is characterized by steep female dominance but shows
   female-female coalitionary support, we expected to confirm the presence
   of reconciliation in the study species. Consistently, we found
   reconciliation in one captive group and two wild groups, thus providing
   the first evidence of the presence of this phenomenon in wild L. catta.
   Moreover, because this species is a seasonal breeder (with mating
   occurring once a year), we expected seasonal fluctuations in
   reconciliation levels. Via a GLMM analysis using data from all wild
   groups and on a captive group followed for more than one year, we found
   that season (but not rank; individuals' identity, sex, and age; or group
   identity) significantly affected individual reconciliation rates, and
   such rates were lowest during the mating period. Thus, reconciliation
   can be present in groups in which dominants strongly influence and limit
   social relationships (steep dominance hierarchy) except when the
   advantages of intra-group cooperation are overcome by competition, as
   occurs in seasonal breeders when reproduction is at stake. We conclude
   that in despotic social groups in which coalitions are observed, the
   right question is not if but when reconciliation can be present.},

   developmental perspectives in developing a hypothesis to account for the
   evolution of `the lemur syndrome', a combination of reduced sexual
   dimorphism, even adult sex ratios, female dominance and mild genital
   masculinization characterizing group-living species in two families of
   Malagasy primates.
   Results: We review the different components of the lemur syndrome and
   compare it with similar adaptations reported for other mammals. We find
   support for the assertion that the lemur syndrome represents a unique
   set of integrated behavioral, demographic and morphological traits. We
   combine existing hypotheses about underlying adaptive function and
   proximate causation by adding a potential developmental mechanism
   linking maternal stress and filial masculinization, and outline an
   evolutionary scenario for its canalization.
   Conclusions: We propose a new hypothesis linking ecological,
   physiological, developmental and evolutionary processes to adumbrate a
   comprehensive explanation for the evolution of the lemur syndrome, whose
   assumptions and predictions can guide diverse future research on lemurs.
   This hypothesis should also encourage students of other behavioral
   phenomena to consider the potential role of developmental plasticity in
   evolutionary innovation.},

Title = {Female rule in lemurs is ancestral and hormonally mediated},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Female social dominance (FSD) over males is unusual in mammals, yet
   characterizes most Malagasy lemurs, which represent almost 30\% of all
   primates. Despite its prevalence in this suborder, both the evolutionary
   trajectory and proximate mechanism of FSD remain unclear. Potentially
   associated with FSD is a suite of behavioural, physiological and
   morphological traits in females that implicates (as a putative
   mechanism) `masculinization' via androgen exposure; however, relative to
   conspecific males, female lemurs curiously show little evidence of
   raised androgen concentrations. By observing mixed-sex pairs of related
   Eulemur species, we identified two key study groups --one comprised of
   species expressing FSD and increased female scent marking, the other
   comprised of species (from a recently evolved clade) showing equal
   status between the sexes and the more traditional pattern of sexually
   dimorphic behaviour. Comparing females from these two groups, we show
   that FSD is associated with more masculine androgen profiles. Based on
   the widespread prevalence of male-like features in female lemurs and a
   current phylogeny, we suggest that relaxation of hormonally mediated FSD
   emerged only recently and that female masculinization may be the
   ancestral lemur condition, an idea that could revolutionize our
   understanding of the ancient socioecology and evolution of primate
   social systems.},

Abstract = {Geospatial modeling is one of the most powerful tools available to
   conservation biologists for estimating current species ranges of Earth's
   biodiversity. Now, with the advantage of predictive climate models,
   these methods can be deployed for understanding future impacts on
   threatened biota. Here, we employ predictive modeling under a
   conservative estimate of future climate change to examine impacts on the
   future abundance and geographic distributions of Malagasy lemurs. Using
   distribution data from the primary literature, we employed ensemble
   species distribution models and geospatial analyses to predict future
   changes in species distributions. Current species distribution models
   (SDMs) were created within the BIOMOD2 framework that capitalizes on ten
   widely used modeling techniques. Future and current SDMs were then
   subtracted from each other, and areas of contraction, expansion, and
   stability were calculated. Model overprediction is a common issue
   associated Malagasy taxa. Accordingly, we introduce novel methods for
   incorporating biological data on dispersal potential to better inform
   the selection of pseudo-absence points. This study predicts that 60\% of
   the 57 species examined will experience a considerable range of
   reductions in the next seventy years entirely due to future climate
   change. Of these species, range sizes are predicted to decrease by an
   average of 59.6\%. Nine lemur species (16\%) are predicted to expand
   their ranges, and 13 species (22.8\%) distribution sizes were predicted
   to be stable through time. Species ranges will experience severe shifts,
   typically contractions, and for the majority of lemur species,
   geographic distributions will be considerably altered. We identify three
   areas in dire need of protection, concluding that strategically managed
   forest corridors must be a key component of lemur and other biodiversity
   conservation strategies. This recommendation is all the more urgent
   given that the results presented here do not take into account patterns
   of ongoing habitat destruction relating to human activities.},

Abstract = {The lifespan and age-specific fecundity of female ring-tailed lemurs
   (Lemur catta) were estimated from a 24-year longitudinal dataset based
   on individual identification at Berenty Reserve, Madagascar. The mean
   lifespan of females in 10-year (1989-1998) birth cohorts was 4.9 +/- 4.9
   years (n = 77), and the longest recorded lifespan in the population was
   20 years. The mortality rate of adult females increased to >= 20\% at
   10-11 years old and reached 33-50\% at 12-15 years old. Although the
   birth rate of old females (12-17 years old) was 72.0\%, slightly lower
   than that of prime adult females (4-11 years old), i.e. 80.2\%, no
   significant difference was found between them. Half of the females who
   reached the age of 12 years gave birth in the last year of their life.
   The oldest mother to give birth was 17 years old. These results suggest
   that most females can maintain reproductive performance in their later
   life and that there is no evidence for a postreproductive lifespan in
   this species. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Title = {Functional promiscuity in a mammalian chemosensory system: extensive
   expression of vomeronasal receptors in the main olfactory epithelium of
   mouse lemurs},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 24},
Abstract = {The vomeronasal organ (VNO) is functional in most terrestrial mammals,
   though progressively reduced in the primate lineage, and is used for
   intraspecific communication and predator recognition. Vomeronasal
   receptor (VR) genes comprise two families of chemosensory genes (V1R and
   V2R) that have been considered to be specific for the VNO. However,
   recently a large number of VRs were reported to be expressed in the main
   olfactory epithelium (MOE) of mice, but there is little knowledge of the
   expression of these genes outside of rodents. To explore the function of
   VR genes in mammalian evolution, we analyzed and compared the expression
   of 64 V1R and 2 V2R genes in the VNO and the MOE of the gray mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus), the primate with the largest known VR repertoire.
   We furthermore compared expression patterns in adults of both sexes and
   seasons, and in an infant. A large proportion (83-97\%) of the VR loci
   was expressed in the VNO of all individuals. The repertoire in the
   infant was as rich as in adults, indicating reliance on olfactory
   communication from early postnatal development onwards. In concordance
   with mice, we also detected extensive expression of VRs in the MOE, with
   proportions of expressed loci in individuals ranging from 29 to 45\%.
   TRPC2, which encodes a channel protein crucial for signal transduction
   via VRs, was co-expressed in the MOE in all individuals indicating
   likely functionality of expressed VR genes in the MOE. In summary, the
   large VR repertoire in mouse lemurs seems to be highly functional. Given
   the differences in the neural pathways of MOE and VNO signals, which
   project to higher cortical brain centers or the limbic system,
   respectively, this raises the intriguing possibility that the evolution
   of MOE-expression of VRs enabled mouse lemurs to adaptively diversify
   the processing of VR-encoded olfactory information.},

Abstract = {Light is the primary synchronizer of all biological rhythms, yet little
   is known about the role of the 24-hour luminous environment on nonhuman
   primate circadian patterns, making it difficult to understand the photic
   niche of the ancestral primate. Here we present the first data on
   proximate light-dark exposure and activity-rest patterns in free-ranging
   nonhuman primates. Four individuals each of five species of lemurs at
   the Duke Lemur Center (Eulemur mongoz, Lemur catta, Propithecus
   coquereli, Varecia rubra, and Varecia variegata variegata) were fitted
   with a Daysimeter-D pendant that contained light and accelerometer
   sensors. Our results reveal common as well as species-specific light
   exposure and behavior patterns. As expected, all five species were more
   active between sunrise and sunset. All five species demonstrated an
   anticipatory increase in their pre-sunrise activity that peaked at
   sunrise with all but V. rubra showing a reduction within an hour. All
   five species reduced activity during mid-day. Four of the five stayed
   active after sunset, but P. coquereli began reducing their activity
   about 2 hours before sunset. Other subtle differences in the recorded
   light exposure and activity patterns suggest species-specific photic
   niches and behaviors. The eventual application of the Daysimeter-D in
   the wild may help to better understand the adaptive evolution of
   ancestral primates. Am J Phys Anthropol 153:68-77, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley

Title = {Defining the Low End of Primate Social Complexity: The Social
   Organization of the Nocturnal White-Footed Sportive Lemur (Lepilemur
   leucopus)},

Abstract = {Whereas other species of sportive lemurs (genus Lepilemur) have been
   described as living in dispersed pairs, which are characterized by
   spatial overlap but a lack of affinity or affiliation between one adult
   male and female, existing reports on the social organization of the
   white-footed sportive lemur (Lepilemur leucopus) are conflicting,
   describing them as either living in dispersed one-male multifemale
   systems or pairs. We conducted this study in the spiny forest of Berenty
   Reserve, southern Madagascar, to clarify the social organization and to
   characterize the level of social complexity of this species. We combined
   1530 h of radio-telemetry and behavioral observations over a period of 1
   yr to describe the spatiotemporal stability, size, and interindividual
   overlap of individual home ranges as well as interindividual
   cohesiveness. Results revealed low intra- and high intersexual home
   range overlap. Although most of the social units identified consisted of
   dispersed pairs (N = 5), males were associated with two adult females in
   two cases. Furthermore, members of a social unit were never observed to
   groom each other or to share a daytime sleeping site, and Hutchinson's
   and Doncaster's dynamic interaction tests indicated active avoidance
   between pair partners. Low cohesiveness together with extremely low
   rates of social interactions therefore arguably places Lepilemur
   leucopus at the low end of primate social complexity.},

Title = {True lemurs ... true species - species delimitation using multiple data
   sources in the brown lemur complex},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {Background: Species are the fundamental units in evolutionary biology.
   However, defining them as evolutionary independent lineages requires
   integration of several independent sources of information in order to
   develop robust hypotheses for taxonomic classification. Here, we
   exemplarily propose an integrative framework for species delimitation in
   the ``brown lemur complex{''} (BLC) of Madagascar, which consists of
   seven allopatric populations of the genus Eulemur (Primates: Lemuridae),
   which were sampled extensively across northern, eastern and western
   Madagascar to collect fecal samples for DNA extraction as well as
   recordings of vocalizations. Our data base was extended by including
   museum specimens with reliable identification and locality information
   for skull shape and pelage color analysis.
   Results: Between-group analyses of principal components revealed
   significant heterogeneity in skull shape, pelage color variation and
   loud calls across all seven populations. Furthermore, post-hoc
   statistical tests between pairs of populations revealed considerable
   discordance among different data sets for different dyads. Despite a
   high degree of incomplete lineage sorting among nuclear loci,
   significant exclusive ancestry was found for all populations, except for
   E. cinereiceps, based on one mitochondrial and three nuclear genetic
   loci.
   Conclusions: Using several independent lines of evidence, our results
   confirm the species status of the members of the BLC under the general
   lineage concept of species. More generally, the present analyses
   demonstrate the importance and value of integrating different kinds of
   data in delimiting recently evolved radiations.},

Title = {Stable isotopes document resource partitioning and effects of forest
   disturbance on sympatric cheirogaleid lemurs},
Journal = {NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {100},
Number = {10},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The future of Madagascar's forests and their resident lemurs is
   precarious. Determining how species respond to forest fragmentation is
   essential for management efforts. We use stable isotope biogeochemistry
   to investigate how disturbance affects resource partitioning between two
   genera of cheirogaleid lemurs (Cheirogaleus and Microcebus) from three
   humid forest sites: continuous and fragmented forest at Tsinjoarivo, and
   selectively logged forest at Ranomafana. We test three hypotheses: (H1)
   cheirogaleids are unaffected by forest fragmentation, (H2) species
   respond individually to disturbance and may exploit novel resources in
   fragmented habitat, and (H3) species alter their behavior to rely on the
   same key resource in disturbed forest. We find significant isotopic
   differences among species and localities. Carbon data suggest that
   Microcebus feed lower in the canopy than Cheirogaleus at all three
   localities and that sympatric Cheirogaleus crossleyi and C. sibreei feed
   at different canopy heights in the fragmented forest. Microcbus have
   higher nitrogen isotope values than Cheirogaleus at all localities,
   indicating more faunivory. After accounting for baseline isotope values
   in plants, our results provide the most support for H3. We find similar
   isotopic variations among localities for both genera. Small differences
   in carbon among localities may reflect shifts in diet or habitat use.
   Elevated nitrogen values for cheirogaleid lemurs in fragments may
   reflect increased arthropod consumption or nutritional stress. These
   results suggest that cheirogaleids are affected by forest disturbance in
   Eastern Madagascar and stress the importance of accounting for baseline
   isotopic differences in plants in any work comparing localities.},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Land use in Madagascar has resulted in extensive deforestation and
   forest fragmentation. Endemic species, such as the black-and-white
   ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata), may be vulnerable to habitat
   fragmentation due to patchy geographic distributions and sensitivities
   to forest disturbance. We tested for genetic differentiation among
   black-and-white ruffed lemur groups in two sites in a large forest patch
   and three sites in smaller patches. We also investigated the
   relationship between the genetic diversity of populations and patch
   configuration (size and isolation), as well as the presence or absence
   of past genetic bottlenecks. We collected blood (n = 22 individuals) or
   fecal (n = 33) samples from lemurs and genotyped the extracted DNA for
   16 polymorphic microsatellites. Bayesian cluster analysis and F-ST
   assigned individuals to three populations: Ranomafana (two sites in
   continuous forest), Kianjavato (two fragments separated by 60 m of
   non-forest), and Vatovavy (a single fragment, more isolated in time and
   space). Vatovavy showed significantly lower allelic richness than
   Ranomafana. Kianjavato also appeared to have lower allelic richness than
   Ranomafana, though the difference was not significant. Vatovavy was also
   the only population with a genetic bottleneck indicated under more than
   one mutation model and a significant F-IS value, showing excess
   heterozygosity. These results indicate that a small geographic
   separation may not be sufficient for genetic differentiation of
   black-and-white ruffed lemur populations and that patch size may
   influence the rapidity with which genetic diversity is lost following
   patch isolation.},

Abstract = {The ixodid ticks parasitizing small-bodied nocturnal mouse and dwarf
   lemurs (Primates, Cheirogaleidae) in Madagascar are poorly documented.
   At Tsinjoarivo, a high-altitude eastern rain forest, mouse and dwarf
   lemurs were parasitized by ixodid ticks. At Ranomafana, a montane
   southeastern rain forest, dwarf lemurs hosted a species of Ixodes,
   whereas mouse lemurs were parasitized by Haemaphysalis lemuris. Ixodes
   specimens represent all active stages, and females are morphologically
   consistent with previous descriptions of Ixodes lemuris females, the
   only described stage in the literature. Morphological comparisons and
   genetic analysis using fragments of COI gene confirm that all Ixodes
   ticks from Tsinjoarivo and Ranomafana forests belong to the same
   species, i.e., Ixodes lemuris. Thus, we are able to provide descriptions
   of the previously unknown larva, nymph, and male. Mouse lemurs at both
   locations were parasitized only by immature stages of I. lemuris (at
   Tsinjoarivo) or H. lemuris (at Ranomafana), whereas dwarf lemurs were
   parasitized by all stages of I. lemuris. We suggest that ecological and
   biogeographical conditions may affect the pattern of tick infestation at
   Tsinjoarivo and Ranomafana. Additional studies are necessary to
   understand the tick-host associations of small-bodied nocturnal lemurs.},

Title = {The Function of Howling in the Ring-Tailed Lemur (Lemur catta)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {157-169},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Long calls are sex-specific vocalizations used for mate attraction or
   mate defense in many animal species. Ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta),
   female-dominant strepsirrhines, have a male-specific long call termed a
   howl, with proposed functions that have never been empirically tested. I
   aimed to investigate why ring-tailed lemur males howl and to test
   whether the mate defense and mate attraction hypotheses for long-calling
   were applicable to this species. From March to July 2010, I collected
   600 h of focal data on 25 males aged a parts per thousand yen3 year at
   Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar. I observed each male
   continuously for 30 min at a time and noted all agonism using one-zero
   sampling at 2.5-min intervals. I calculated male dominance rank from
   these data. I recorded days when female estrus occurred and noted
   howling and intergroup encounters using all-occurrences sampling.
   Howling rate was not significantly related to female estrus or male
   dominance rank, providing no support for the mate attraction hypothesis
   or the intragroup mate defense hypothesis. In contrast, the intergroup
   mate defense hypothesis was strongly supported. During intergroup
   encounters, male howling rate significantly increased compared to
   howling rate at times without other groups present, and a greater number
   of males participated in multimale howling choruses when compared to
   times without nongroup members present. My results suggest that male
   ring-tailed lemurs howl to advertise their presence and location to
   other groups, but not to male or female members of their own group.
   Howling could discourage male immigration by advertising the number of
   males already present in a group. Long calls are used for similar mate
   defense purposes during intergroup encounters by other primates,
   including Thomas langurs (Presbytis thomasi) and chacma baboons (Papio
   ursinus).},

Abstract = {Large home ranges and extreme flexibility in ranging behaviors
   characterize most subarid dwelling haplorhines. However, the most
   comparable extant strepsirhine, Lemur catta, is characterized as having
   small home ranges with consistent boundaries. Since ranging studies on
   this species have been limited to gallery forest habitat, the author's
   goal is to identify ecological factors that affect range use of L. catta
   in one of the most resource-limited environments of its distribution. To
   conduct this study, ranging and behavioral data were collected on two
   nonoverlapping groups through all-day follows in the semidesert scrub
   environment of Cap Sainte-Marie (CSM), Madagascar. Data were collected
   from August 2007 through July 2008. Home range areas and day range
   lengths were generated using ArcGIS (R) 9.3. Other variables measured
   were habitat composition, diet richness, daily activity, and
   microclimate. Home range areas of CSM L. catta were very large relative
   to those of gallery forest L. catta, and there was great monthly
   variation. In contrast, day range lengths at CSM were either smaller
   than or approximated the size of comparative gallery forest groups.
   Temperature, sunning, and diet richness were associated with day range
   length for one but not for both groups and appear to be related to
   energy management needs. Based on these findings, the author suggests
   that L. catta is capable of extensive behavioral and ranging flexibility
   in the extremes of its environment. However, physiological constraints
   impose limitations that can interfere with its ability to adapt to even
   seemingly minor variations in microclimate and habitat structure within
   the same site. Am J Phys Anthropol 150:122-132, 2013. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {The critical role of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes in
   disease resistance, along with their putative function in sexual
   selection, reproduction and chemical ecology, make them an important
   genetic system in evolutionary ecology. Studying selective pressures
   acting on MHC genes in the wild nevertheless requires population-wide
   genotyping, which has long been challenging because of their extensive
   polymorphism. Here, we report on large-scale genotyping of the MHC class
   II loci of the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) from a wild
   population in western Madagascar. The second exons from MHC-DRB and -DQB
   of 772 and 672 individuals were sequenced, respectively, using a 454
   sequencing platform, generating more than 800,000 reads. Sequence
   analysis, through a stepwise variant validation procedure, allowed
   reliable typing of more than 600 individuals. The quality of our
   genotyping was evaluated through three independent methods, namely
   genotyping the same individuals by both cloning and 454 sequencing,
   running duplicates, and comparing parent-offspring dyads; each
   displaying very high accuracy. A total of 61 (including 20 new) and 60
   (including 53 new) alleles were detected at DRB and DQB genes,
   respectively. Both loci were non-duplicated, in tight linkage
   disequilibrium and in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, despite the fact that
   sequence analysis revealed clear evidence of historical selection. Our
   results highlight the potential of 454 sequencing technology in attempts
   to investigate patterns of selection shaping MHC variation in
   contemporary populations. The power of this approach will nevertheless
   be conditional upon strict quality control of the genotyping data.},

Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {Since age-dependent deposition of A beta-amyloid has been reported in
   the Microcebus murinus, we posited that this animal could as well be a
   model of age-related synucleinopathy. We characterized the distribution
   of A beta-amyloid, alpha-synuclein and two of its modified forms in the
   brain of Microcebus murinus aged from 1.5 to 10 years. Intracytoplasmic
   alpha-synuclein aggregates were observed only in aged animals in
   different brain regions, which were also phospho-Ser129 and nitrated
   alpha-synuclein immunoreactive. Age-dependent alpha-synuclein
   aggregation occurs spontaneously in mouse lemur primates. Microcebus
   murinus may provide a model to study age-associated
   alpha-synucleinopathy and for testing putative therapeutic interventions
   for both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.},

Title = {On the function of redfronted lemur's close calls},
Journal = {ANIMAL COGNITION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Pages = {823-831},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In order to maintain group cohesion, many social mammals and birds
   regularly produce close calls. In some primate species, close calls
   appear to have a dual function: calls addressed at a broad class of
   targets serve to maintain group cohesion, whereas the same calls
   directed at a specific target serve to regulate subsequent social
   interactions. Redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) produce different
   types of close calls: grunts, long grunts, hoos and meows. In order to
   study the function of these calls, we conducted focal observations and
   vocal recordings from eight adult males and females out of four social
   groups in Kirindy Forest, Western Madagascar. Redfronted lemurs produce
   long grunts, hoos and meows at relatively low rates during foraging,
   resting or group movements, respectively. Grunts were given most often
   and more or less constantly during foraging and traveling. Calling rate
   increased when the risk of separation increased and may thus promote
   group cohesion. Grunts given during approaches of other group members
   resulted more often in friendly interactions than approaches that were
   not accompanied by a grunt. Thus, redfronted lemurs produce specific but
   also generic contact calls, whereas the latter calls have a dual
   function that varies depending on the addressed audience: they act as an
   auditory beacon to maintain group cohesion and serve as signals of
   benign intent to avoid costly conflicts and facilitating social
   interactions.},

Title = {An Alu-Based Phylogeny of Lemurs (Infraorder: Lemuriformes)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Lemurs (infraorder: Lemuriformes) are a radiation of strepsirrhine
   primates endemic to the island of Madagascar. As of 2012, 101 lemur
   species, divided among five families, have been described. Genetic and
   morphological evidence indicates all species are descended from a common
   ancestor that arrived in Madagascar similar to 55-60 million years ago
   (mya). Phylogenetic relationships in this species-rich infraorder have
   been the subject of debate. Here we use Alu elements, a family of
   primate-specific Short INterspersed Elements (SINEs), to construct a
   phylogeny of infraorder Lemuriformes. Alu elements are particularly
   useful SINEs for the purpose of phylogeny reconstruction because they
   are identical by descent and confounding events between loci are easily
   resolved by sequencing. The genome of the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus
   murinus) was computationally assayed for synapomorphic Alu elements.
   Those that were identified as Lemuriformes-specific were analyzed
   against other available primate genomes for orthologous sequence in
   which to design primers for PCR (polymerase chain reaction)
   verification. A primate phylogenetic panel of 24 species, including 22
   lemur species from all five families, was examined for the
   presence/absence of 138 Alu elements via PCR to establish relationships
   among species. Of these, 111 were phylogenetically informative. A
   phylogenetic tree was generated based on the results of this analysis.
   We demonstrate strong support for the monophyly of Lemuriformes to the
   exclusion of other primates, with Daubentoniidae, the aye-aye, as the
   basal lineage within the infraorder. Our results also suggest
   Lepilemuridae as a sister lineage to Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae as
   sister to Lemuridae. Among the Cheirogaleidae, we show strong support
   for Microcebus and Mirza as sister genera, with Cheirogaleus the sister
   lineage to both. Our results also support the monophyly of the
   Lemuridae. Within Lemuridae we place Lemur and Hapalemur together to the
   exclusion of Eulemur and Varecia, with Varecia the sister lineage to the
   other three genera.},

Abstract = {Signal complexity has been linked to social complexity in vocal, but not
   chemical, communication. To address this gap, we examined the chemical
   complexity of male and female glandular secretions in eight species of
   Eulemur. In this diverse clade of macrosmatic primates, species differ
   by social or mating system and dominance structure. We applied principal
   component and linear discriminate analyses to data obtained by gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry. Beyond the significant effects on
   chemical signals of gland type, sex, season and species, we found
   effects of social variables and phylogeny. Notably, female odours were
   more chemically complex in multimale-multifemale species than
   pair-bonded species, whereas male odours were more chemically complex in
   codominant species than female-dominant species. Also, the traditional
   sexual dimorphism, whereby male signal complexity exceeds that of
   females, was present in codominant species, but reversed in
   female-dominant species. Lastly, a positive relationship between the
   species' pairwise chemical distances and their pairwise phylogenetic
   distances supported a gradual, but relatively fast mode of signal
   evolution. We suggest that the comparative method can be a powerful tool
   in olfactory research, revealing species differences relevant to the
   understanding of current signal utility and evolutionary processes. In
   particular, social complexity in lemurs may have selected for olfactory
   complexity.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of dietary mechanical properties can be informative about
   physical consequences to consumers during ingestion and mastication. In
   this article, we examine how Tamarindus indica fruits can affect dental
   morphology in a population of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) at Beza
   Mahafaly special reserve in southwestern Madagascar. Ring-tailed lemurs
   in tamarind dominated gallery forests exhibit extreme wear and tooth
   loss on their postcanine dentition that has been related to processing
   T. indica fruits. We measured and compared mechanical properties of
   individual food parts in the diet of ring-tailed lemurs in different
   seasons in 19992000, 2008, and 2010. Fracture toughness, hardness, and
   modulus of foods were measured with a portable mechanical tester. The
   ripe fruits of T. indica are indeed the toughest and hardest foods
   ingested by the lemurs. In addition, they are among the largest foods
   consumed, require high numbers of ingestive bites to process, and are
   the most frequently eaten by volume. During controlled cutting tests of
   the ripe fruit shell, multiple runaway side cracks form alongside the
   cut. Similarly, the lemurs repeatedly bite the ripe shell during feeding
   and thereby introduce multiple cracks that eventually fragment the
   shell. Studies of enamel microstructure (e.g., Lucas et al.: BioEssays
   30 (2008) 374385; Campbell et al., 2011) advance the idea that the thin
   enamel of ring-tailed lemur teeth is susceptible to substantial
   micro-cracking that rapidly erodes the teeth. We conclude that
   micro-cracking from repeated loads, in combination with the mechanical
   and physical properties of the fruit, is primarily responsible for the
   observed dental damage. Am J Phys Anthropol 148:205214, 2012. (c) 2012

Title = {Determinants of Pair-Living in Red-Tailed Sportive Lemurs (Lepilemur

Volume = {118},

Abstract = {Pair-living and a monogamous mating strategy are rare and theoretically
   unexpected among mammals. Nevertheless, about 10\% of primate species
   exhibit such a social system, which is difficult to explain in the
   absence of paternal care. In this study, we investigated the two major
   hypotheses proposed to explain the evolution of monogamy in mammals, the
   female defence hypothesis (FDH) and the resource defence hypothesis
   (RDH), in red-tailed sportive lemurs (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), a
   nocturnal primate from Madagascar. We analysed behavioural data from
   eight malefemale pairs collected during a 24-mo field study to
   illuminate the determinants of pair-living in this species. Male and
   female L.similar to ruficaudatus were found to live in dispersed pairs,
   which are characterised by low cohesion and low encounter rates within a
   common home range. Social interactions between pair partners were mainly
   agonistic and characterised by a complete absence of affiliative
   interactions body contact was only observed during mating. During the
   short annual mating season, males exhibited elevated levels of
   aggression towards mates, as well as extensive mate guarding and
   increased locomotor activity. In addition, males were exclusively
   responsible for the maintenance of proximity between pair partners
   during this period, and they defended their territories against
   neighbouring males but not against females. Together, these results
   point towards the importance of female defence in explaining pair-living
   in L.similar to ruficaudatus. We discuss the spatial and temporal
   distribution of receptive females in relation to the female defence
   strategies of males and suggest possible costs that prevent male
   red-tailed sportive lemurs from defending more than one female.},

Title = {Density Estimates of Two Endangered Nocturnal Lemur Species From

Abstract = {Very little information is known of the recently described Microcebus
   tavaratra and Lepilemur milanoii in the Daraina region, a restricted
   area in far northern Madagascar. Since their forest habitat is highly
   fragmented and expected to undergo significant changes in the future,
   rapid surveys are essential to determine conservation priorities. Using
   both distance sampling and capturerecapture methods, we estimated
   population densities in two forest fragments. Our results are the first
   known density and population size estimates for both nocturnal species.
   In parallel, we compare density results from four different approaches,
   which are widely used to estimate lemur densities and population sizes
   throughout Madagascar. Four approaches (King, Kelker, Muller and
   Buckland) are based on transect surveys and distance sampling, and they
   differ from each other by the way the effective strip width is
   estimated. The fifth method relies on a capturemarkrecapture (CMR)
   approach. Overall, we found that the King method produced density
   estimates that were significantly higher than other methods, suggesting
   that it generates overestimates and hence overly optimistic estimates of
   population sizes in endangered species. The other three distance
   sampling methods provided similar estimates. These estimates were
   similar to those obtained with the CMR approach when enough recapture
   data were available. Given that Microcebus species are often trapped for
   genetic or behavioral studies, our results suggest that existing data
   can be used to provide estimates of population density for that species
   across Madagascar. Am. J. Primatol. 74:414-422, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {This study investigated the acoustic structure of grunt vocalizations in
   red-bellied lemurs (Eulemur rubriventer) and its potential for
   individual discrimination. Acoustic analyses were performed on 1,605
   grunts recorded from seven lemurs belonging to two captive groups. From
   the perspective of sound-filter theory, we described the acoustic
   structure of grunts, measuring two sets of parameters: fundamental
   frequency characteristics as larynx- related variables and four formant
   frequencies as filter-related features. Formants were effective in
   assigning 80.5\% of the vocalizations to the correct emitter against
   24.9\% scored by the model based on larynx-related variables. We
   concluded that vocal tract resonances might potentially provide
   conspecifics with individual cues.},

   brain function and health. In the present study, the authors
   investigated this effect by comparing sleep-wake cycles in adult lemurs
   based on electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms. The effect of short-term
   RSV supplementation on the sleep-wake cycle of mouse lemurs was
   evaluated in entrained conditions (long-day photoperiods, light: dark
   14:10). After 3 wks of RSV supplementation, the animals exhibited a
   significantly increased proportion of active-wake time, occurring mainly
   during the resting phase of the sleep-wake cycle (+163\%). The increase
   in active-wake time with RSV supplementation was accompanied by a
   significant reduction of both paradoxical sleep (-95\%) and slow-wave
   sleep (-38\%). These changes mainly occurred during the resting phase of
   the sleep-wake cycle (RSV supplementation induced negligible changes in
   active-wake time during the active phase of the sleep-wake cycle). The
   present data suggest that RSV may be a potent regulator of sleep-wake
   rhythms and could be of major interest in the study of sleep
   perturbations associated with aging and neuropathology. (Author

Abstract = {Group-living species have to coordinate collective actions to maintain
   cohesion. In primates, spatial movements represent a meaningful model to
   study group coordination processes across different socio-ecological
   contexts. We studied 4 groups of red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons)
   in Kirindy Forest, Madagascar, between 2008 and 2010 across different
   ecological and reproductive seasons. We collected data on ranging
   patterns using GPS collars and observational data on different
   predefined parameters of group movements, including initiation,
   leadership, followership, overtaking events, termination, and travel
   distances. Cohesion of these relatively small, egalitarian lemur groups
   was high year-round, but daily path length and home range size varied
   considerably between ecological seasons, presumably due to long-distance
   migrations of some groups at the beginning of the rainy season.
   Individuals of different age and sex classes successfully initiated
   group movements. However, stable female leadership prevailed year-round,
   irrespective of ecological and reproductive season, which might be due
   to higher or more specific energetic requirements of reproduction. In
   contrast to lemur species with a more despotic social structure, female
   red-fronted lemurs did not recruit more followers than males. Adult
   leaders recruited more followers than subadult ones. Further,
   recruitment success was higher during the peak of the dry season, when
   predation risk appeared to be higher. Distances of single group
   movements did not depend on the initiator's sex and age or on ecological
   seasons. Our results provide new insights into seasonal variability of
   coordination processes and the role of social dominance in lemur group
   movements, thereby contributing to a comparative perspective from a
   primate radiation that evolved group living independently of
   anthropoids.},

Title = {Timing the origin of human malarias: the lemur puzzle},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Background: Timing the origin of human malarias has been a focus of
   great interest. Previous studies on the mitochondrial genome concluded
   that Plasmodium in primates, including those parasitic to humans,
   radiated relatively recently during a process where host switches were
   common. Those investigations, however, assumed constant rate of
   evolution and tightly bound (fixed) calibration points based on host
   fossils or host distribution. We investigate the effect of such
   assumptions using different molecular dating methods. We include
   parasites from Lemuroidea since their distribution provides an external
   validation to time estimates allowing us to disregard scenarios that
   cannot explain their introduction in Madagascar.
   Results: We reject the assumption that the Plasmodium mitochondrial
   genome, as a unit or each gene separately, evolves at a constant rate.
   Our analyses show that Lemuroidea parasites are a monophyletic group
   that shares a common ancestor with all Catarrhini malarias except those
   related to P. falciparum. However, we found no evidence that this group
   of parasites branched with their hosts early in the evolution of
   primates. We applied relaxed clock methods and different calibrations
   points to explore the origin of primate malarias including those found
   in African apes. We showed that previous studies likely underestimated
   the origin of malarial parasites in primates.
   Conclusions: The use of fossils from the host as absolute calibration
   and the assumption of a strict clock likely underestimate time when
   performing molecular dating analyses on malarial parasites. Indeed, by
   exploring different calibration points, we found that the time for the
   radiation of primate parasites may have taken place in the Eocene, a
   time consistent with the radiation of African anthropoids. The radiation
   of the four human parasite lineages was part of such events. The time
   frame estimated in this investigation, together with our phylogenetic
   analyses, made plausible a scenario where gorillas and humans acquired
   malaria from a Pan lineage.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In arboreal animals such as the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus
   Miller, 1777), leaping is the most frequent strategy for predator
   avoidance. The aim of this study was to characterise the locomotor
   adaptation in response to the structural constraint of the habitat
   (i.e., position of the landing substrate). Thus, we characterised the
   push-off phase by inducing the lemurs to leap up to a range of heights
   from horizontal to their own individual highest performance. Using
   uniplanar high-frequency cineradiographs collected in a sagittal plane,
   the relative contributions of the centre of mass (CoM) velocity vector
   magnitude and orientation to leaping performance were evaluated. The
   kinematics of the push-off phase showed that for low landing heights,
   leaping performance was essentially due to hip and knee extensions.
   Higher leaps seemed to be related to an increase in ankle contribution.
   At all leaping heights, the proximal-to-distal sequence of the hind limb
   joints controlled the orientation and magnitude of the M. murinus CoM
   velocity vector while pushing off. Finally, the analysis of the velocity
   vector at the onset of take-off suggested that the optimal solution for
   predator avoidance was to leap for horizontal distance and not for
   vertical distance. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Title = {On species delimitation: Yet another lemur species or just genetic
   variation?},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 21},
Abstract = {Background: Although most taxonomists agree that species are
   independently evolving metapopulation lineages that should be delimited
   with several kinds of data, the taxonomic practice in Malagasy primates
   (Lemuriformes) looks quite different. Several recently described lemur
   species are based solely on evidence of genetic distance and diagnostic
   characters of mitochondrial DNA sequences sampled from a few individuals
   per location. Here we explore the validity of this procedure for species
   delimitation in lemurs using published sequence data.
   Results: We show that genetic distance estimates and Population
   Aggregation Analysis (PAA) are inappropriate for species delimitation in
   this group of primates. Intra- and interspecific genetic distances
   overlapped in 14 of 17 cases independent of the genetic marker used. A
   simulation of a fictive taxonomic study indicated that for the
   mitochondrial D-loop the minimum required number of individuals sampled
   per location is 10 in order to avoid false positives via PAA.
   Conclusions: Genetic distances estimates and PAA alone should not be
   used for species delimitation in lemurs. Instead, several nuclear and
   sex-specific loci should be considered and combined with other data sets
   from morphology, ecology or behavior. Independent of the data source,
   sampling should be done in a way to ensure a quantitative comparison of
   intra- and interspecific variation of the taxa in question. The results
   of our study also indicate that several of the recently described lemur
   species should be reevaluated with additional data and that the number
   of good species among the currently known taxa is probably lower than
   currently assumed.},

Abstract = {The authors have determined a consensus sequence for exons 1 and 2 of

   nonneoplastic liver and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) from affected
   animals for mutations in these exons. Frozen liver samples were
   collected from 20 animals representing 9 different species with a sex
   distribution of 10 males and 10 females. A total of 26 liver samples,
   including 11 normal livers, 9 HCC, and 6 samples from nonneoplastic
   regions of liver from animals with HCC, were evaluated. This is the
   first report of the consensus sequence for exons 1 and 2 of H-ras in
   prosimians, and the authors have determined that it is identical to that
   of human H-ras and differs only slightly from the chimpanzee sequence.
   Point mutations were identified in 6 of the 9 HCC samples examined with
   codons 7, 22, 32, 56, 61, 84, and 96 affected. Two carcinomas had double
   mutations, and one tumor had triple mutations. One HCC had a mutation in
   codon 61, which is identical to a recognized affected codon for an H-ras
   ``hot spot{''} in rodent neoplasia that has also been reported in human
   tumors. Although not statistically different, metastasis occurred in 5
   of 6 HCC with H-ras mutation and only 1 of 3 HCC without mutations.
   There were 4 silent mutations that did not contain changes in the
   encoded amino acids, 2 of which were found in nonneoplastic regions of

   using pelage traits and measured standard morphometric variables.
   Results from our study suggest that hybridization between E. rufifrons
   and E. cinereiceps is extensive, with the hybrid zone extending over
   42.6 km and being composed mostly of later generation hybrids. We also
   identified significant variation between ancestral groups in our study:
   hybrid males exhibited longer tails than both parental species and
   sexual dimorphism in upper canine height favoring males was documented
   in E. rufifrons. These patterns could suggest that gene flow between
   parental and hybrid populations is relatively limited. Finally,
   significant differences between ancestral groups in relative body mass
   and skin-fold thickness were absent in our study, indicating that, as
   measured by these proxies, hybrids are equally as fit as parental forms.
   Based on these preliminary findings, the Andringitra hybrid zone could
   conform to the bounded superiority model of hybrid zone stability (i.e.,
   it could be being maintained by selection favoring hybrids within
   transitional habitats). Accordingly, hybrids in Andringitra may be an
   unusual case among primates, representing a stable recombinant but
   distinct lineage. This conclusion has important implications for
   evolutionary processes within the brown lemur species complex. Am J Phys
   Anthropol 145:55-66, 2011. (C)2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Endocrine correlates of pregnancy in the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur
   catta): Implications for the masculinization of daughters},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Female ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur cotta) are Malagasy primates that are
   size monomorphic with males, socially dominate males, and exhibit a
   long, pendulous clitoris, channeled by the urethra. These masculine
   traits evoke certain attributes of female spotted hyenas (Crocuta
   crocuta) and draw attention to the potential role of androgens in lemur
   sexual differentiation. Here, hormonal correlates of prenatal
   development were assessed to explore the possibility that maternal
   androgens may shape the masculine morphological and behavioral features
   of developing female lemurs. Maternal serum 17
   alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S), 6,4
   androstenedione (androst-4-ene-3,17,dione), testosterone, and 17
   beta-estradiol were charted throughout the 19 pregnancies of 11
   ring-tailed lemurs. As in spotted hyenas, lemur pregnancies were
   associated with an immediate increase in androgen concentrations
   (implicating early maternal derivation), followed by continued increases
   across stages of gestation. Pregnancies that produced singleton males,
   twin males, or mixed-sex twins were marked by greater androgen and
   estrogen concentrations than were pregnancies that produced singleton or
   twin females, especially in the third trimester, implicating the fetal
   testes in late-term steroid profiles. Concentrations of DHEA-S were
   mostly below detectable limits, suggesting a minor role for the adrenals
   in androgen biosynthesis. Androgen concentrations of pregnant lemurs
   bearing female fetuses, although less than those of pregnant hyenas,
   exceeded preconception and postpartum values and peaked in the third
   trimester. Although a maternal (and, on occasion, fraternal) source of
   androgen may exist for fetal lemurs, further research is required to
   confirm that these steroids would reach the developing female and
   contribute to her masculinization. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {Live fast, die young: flexibility of life history traits in the
   fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius)},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {65},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The fat-tailed dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus medius, occurs in ecologically
   very different habitat types (rainforest and dry forest) across
   Madagascar. Its extraordinary biological characteristics, such as
   monogamy and long-term hibernation, allow us to investigate behavioral,
   ecological, and physiological flexibility of this species in populations
   across different ecological environments. This study aims to determine
   whether different life history and physiological traits show variation
   in adaptation to the differing ambient conditions or are conservative
   and influenced more by the organism's evolutionary history. We compared
   body masses, life history traits, social organization, and hibernation
   duration of two populations of C. medius, one from a littoral rainforest
   and one from the dry deciduous forest. We revealed clear geographical
   differences in the length of hibernation duration as well as, more
   surprisingly, in life history traits. We found that this species'
   reproductive strategies seem to be highly flexible. Animals in the
   rainforest can spend more time in the active state due to a shorter
   hibernation period, but have, in general, a shorter life expectancy due
   to higher mortality rates. Hence, they seem to maximize their total
   reproductive output with higher reproductive rates (larger litter sizes,
   greater number of litters). Home ranges and social organization, on the
   other hand, did not vary between habitats, suggesting that the general
   requirements of this species are independent of environmental
   conditions. In conclusion, some life history traits, formerly assumed to
   be genetically fixed parameters of primate species, prove in fact to be
   highly flexible. Different populations of the same species show distinct
   adaptations according to the prevailing conditions in order to maximize
   individual reproductive output.},

Abstract = {Animals, including humans, use olfaction to assess potential social and
   sexual partners. Although hormones modulate olfactory cues, we know
   little about whether contraception affects semiochemical signals and,
   ultimately, mate choice. We examined the effects of a common
   contraceptive, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), on the olfactory cues
   of female ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta), and the behavioural response
   these cues generated in male conspecifics. The genital odorants of
   contracepted females were dramatically altered, falling well outside the
   range of normal female variation: MPA decreased the richness and
   modified the relative abundances of volatile chemicals expressed in
   labial secretions. Comparisons between treatment groups revealed several
   indicator compounds that could reliably signal female reproductive
   status to conspecifics. MPA also changed a female's individual chemical
   `signature', while minimizing her chemical distinctiveness relative to
   other contracepted females. Most remarkably, MPA degraded the chemical
   patterns that encode honest information about genetic constitution,
   including individual diversity (heterozygosity) and pairwise relatedness
   to conspecifics. Lastly, males preferentially investigated the odorants
   of intact over contracepted females, clearly distinguishing those with
   immediate reproductive potential. By altering the olfactory cues that
   signal fertility, individuality, genetic quality and relatedness,
   contraceptives may disrupt intraspecific interactions in primates,
   including those relevant to kin recognition and mate choice.},

Title = {Global climate cycles and cyclones: consequences for rainfall patterns

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {219-227},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Most studies that examine the influence of climatic change on flora and
   fauna have focused on northern latitudes; however, there is increasing
   recognition that tropical regions are also being affected. Despite this,
   regions such as Madagascar, which are rich in endemic biodiversity but
   may have low adaptive capacity to climatic change, are poorly
   represented in studies examining the effects of climate variability on
   biota. We investigated how El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO)
   influence precipitation patterns in the rainforest region of
   southeastern Madagascar (1962-2006) and then constructed models to
   assess the potential contribution of climatic variables on the
   reproductive parameters of the Milne Edward's sifaka, a threatened lemur
   species (Propithecus edwardsi), over a 20-year period. The Southern
   Oscillation Index of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the
   tropical Pacific was associated with precipitation patterns including
   wetter wet seasons during warmer phases and drier dry seasons following
   cooler phases. The best-supported models of lemur fecundity (female
   offspring per female that survive to 1 year of age per year) included
   cyclone presence during gestation and ENSO phase before conception and
   during the first 6 months of life. Models also suggested that heavy
   rains during gestation may limit birth rates and that prolonged drought
   during female lactation may limit first year offspring survival;
   although these variables were given little importance for predicting
   overall fecundity relative to ENSO phases and cyclone presence. Our
   results linking lemur reproduction with climatic variability suggest
   that climatic changes may be an additional threat to Madagascar's unique
   and already endangered flora and fauna. The association between
   precipitation in southeastern Madagascar and SST anomalies in the
   tropical Pacific suggests that dynamics of wildlife populations even in
   tropical areas such as Madagascar can be affected by global climate
   cycles making them potentially vulnerable to global climate change.},

Abstract = {Detailed knowledge of the identity and distributions of extant species
   is essential for unravelling patterns and mechanisms of biodiversity,
   and it provides indispensable baseline data for conservation efforts.
   The taxonomy of the primates of Madagascar (Lemuriformes) has
   experienced drastic revisions in the last decades, with species numbers
   skyrocketing, especially in the genera Microcebus, Avahi, and Lepilemur.
   The dwarf lemurs (genus Cheirogaleus) have received less attention in
   terms of their taxonomy, even though they are closely related and
   syntopic with these diverse genera. The last revision of the genus was
   based on morphological data from museum specimens, and accepted seven
   species: Cheirogaleus medius, Cheirogaleus major, Cheirogaleus
   crossleyi, Cheirogaleus adipicaudatus, Cheirogaleus sibreei,
   Cheirogaleus ravus, and Cheirogaleus minusculus, whereas a more recent
   multilocus molecular study only detected three lineages: C. medius, C.
   major, and C. crossleyi. The goal of this study was to reassess the
   currently accepted taxonomy of the genus by examining six external and
   32 craniodental characters of 120 museum specimens and 36 new specimens
   from the field. This study, in conjunction with a complementary
   molecular study, revealed lower diversity and a lower number of distinct
   morphs of dwarf lemurs than previously postulated. We conclude that in
   our sample there are three distinct morphs in the genus Cheirogaleus
   that correspond to C. medius, C. major, and C. crossleyi. We formally
   recognize C. adipicaudatus and C. ravus as synonyms of C. medius and C.
   major, respectively, and consider C. minusculus and C. sibreei to be
   potential synonyms of C. medius. (C) 2010 The Linnean Society of London,

   found that reconciliation occurs only in the non-feeding context and
   that it works in reducing the risk of renewed aggression. Thus,
   reconciliation would provide an immediate positive feedback that is
   probably independent of the quality of the relationship between
   opponents. Reconciliation may also be a hic-et-nunc mechanism, needed to
   avoid conflict spreading across group members, possibly leading to
   social disruption.},

Abstract = {The variation variation of chlorophyll-a concentration during 2003-2007
   was studied in Bali Strait, Indonesia, using Aqua-Modis satellite data,
   and their relationships with catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of
   Sardinella lemuru, sea surface temperature (SST) and indices of climate
   variability (Nino 3.4 and Indian Ocean Dipole Mode Index) were analyzed.
   An inverse relationship was found between SST and chlorophyll-a
   anomalies. Chlorophyll-a anomalies significantly increased at the end of
   2006, reaching 1 mg/m(3) above normal. This increase corresponded with
   upwelling processes represented by a drop of SST during the El Nino
   event that coincided with changes in the Indian Ocean Dipole at the end
   of 2006. There was an unlagged response between chlorophyll-a and SST.
   However, there was an integrated response between chlorophyll-a and the
   CPUE of S. lemuru, such that increased catches (and CPUE) of S. lemuru
   were most highly correlated with increased chlorophyll-a in the prior
   three months. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

   Behavior Solicited by Females?},

Abstract = {Male mate guarding can take many forms but often involves aggression
   toward male conspecifics and continued proximity with a female. This
   study describes a previously undocumented behavior in a promiscuous
   primate, the ring-tailed lemur: post-ejaculatory (PE) mounting. PE
   mounting was documented across eight mating seasons in a ring-tailed
   lemur colony on St. Catherines Island (SCI), USA. During PE mounting, a
   male remounts a female following ejaculation and clasps her midsection
   as if to mate again, but copulation does not occur; males showing this
   behavior typically lack erections, and their mounts show an absence of
   penile intromission and rhythmic thrusting. Male PE mounting was more
   common among males mating earlier in the queue, and when PE mounting
   occurred, it accompanied mate guarding. Four non-mutually exclusive
   hypotheses to explain PE mounting were evaluated as follows: (1) gaining
   additional copulations, (2) prevention of re-mating, (3) lengthening
   sperm residence time, and (4) re-mounting as a function of female
   proceptivity. Male PE mounting did not aid males in gaining additional
   copulations nor did PE mounting prevent females from mating with new
   males. Equivocal support was found for Hypothesis 3: although there was
   much overlap in copulatory plug residence times for males who did and
   did not show PE mounting, one-third of males who practiced PE mounting
   had plug residence times of 2 h or more, much longer than that of males
   who did not show PE mounting. PE mounting may therefore be related to
   increased plug residence time, which may provide an advantage to males
   in sperm competition. Strong evidence was found in support of Hypothesis
   4: males overwhelmingly performed PE mounts in response to continued
   female sexual presentations, suggesting that females can solicit this
   male behavior. Females consequently exercise an even greater degree of
   control over males than was previously realized in this `female
   dominant' primate.},

Title = {Message `scent': lemurs detect the genetic relatedness and quality of
   conspecifics via olfactory cues},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {80},
Number = {1},
Pages = {101-108},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {To enhance the fitness benefits of social and sexual interaction,
   animals should be able to decipher information about the genetic makeup
   of conspecifics. The use of relative criteria to estimate genetic
   relatedness could facilitate nepotism or inbreeding avoidance, and the
   use of absolute criteria to estimate genetic quality could help identify
   the fittest competitor or the best mate. For animals to process
   trade-offs between relatedness and quality, however, both relative and
   absolute genetic information must be concurrently available and
   detectable by conspecifics. Although there is increasing evidence to
   suggest that animals make genetically informed decisions about their
   partners, and may even process trade-offs, we understand relatively
   little about the sensory mechanisms informing these decisions. In
   previous analyses of the olfactory signals of ringtailed lemurs, Lemur
   catta, we showed that both scrotal and labial secretions seasonally
   encode chemical information about (1) pairwise genetic relatedness,
   within and between the sexes, and (2) individual heterozygosity. Here,
   using a signaller-receiver paradigm, we conducted behavioural bioassays
   to test whether male and female lemurs are sensitive to these olfactory
   sources of genetic information in unfamiliar conspecifics. As the lemurs
   discriminated conspecific glandular secretions by pairwise relatedness
   and individual heterozygosity, volatile olfactory signals can be used by
   both sexes to concurrently process relative and absolute genetic
   information about conspecifics. Beyond supporting an olfactory mechanism
   of kin discrimination and mate choice in a primate, we suggest that
   animals could use olfactory processing to trade off between selection
   for the most compatible partner versus the most genetically diverse
   partner. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {Parasites and infectious diseases represent ecological forces shaping
   animal social evolution. Although empirical studies supporting this link
   abound in various vertebrate orders, both the study of the dynamics and
   impact of parasite infections and infectious diseases in strepsirrhine
   primates have received little empirical attention. We conducted a
   longitudinal parasitological study on four groups of wild red-fronted
   lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus) at Kirindy Forest, Madagascar, during two
   field seasons in consecutive years to investigate i) the degree of
   gastrointestinal parasite infection on population and individual levels
   and ii) factors potentially determining individual infection risk. Using
   a comprehensive dataset with multiple individually assignable parasite
   samples as well as information on age, sex, group size, social rank, and
   endocrine status (fecal androgen and glucocorticoid), we examined
   parasite infection patterns and host traits that may affect individual
   infection risk. In addition, we examined whether parasite infection
   affects mating and reproductive success. Our results indicated high
   variability in parasite infection on individual and population levels.
   Time of year and group size was important determinants of variability in
   parasite infection. Variation in hormone levels was also associated with
   parasite species richness and parasite infection intensity. Differences
   in parasite infection between years indicate a potential
   immune-enhancing function of steroid hormones on nematode infections,
   which has not been reported before from other vertebrates studied under
   natural conditions. Male mating and reproductive success were not
   correlated to any measure of parasite infection, which suggests a
   nonfunctional role of the parasites we examined in primate sexual
   selection. Am J Phys Anthropol 142:441-452, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss,

Volume = {116},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {Although one-third of all primates are nocturnal, their anti-predator
   behaviour has rarely been studied. Because of their small body size, in
   combination with their solitary and nocturnal life style, it has been
   suggested that they mainly rely on crypsis to evade predators. However,
   recent studies revealed that nocturnal primates are not generally
   cryptic and that they exhibit predator-specific escape strategies as
   well as alarm calls. In order to add to this new body of research, we
   studied anti-predator strategies of nocturnal grey mouse lemurs
   experimentally. In order to elicit anti-predator behaviour and alarm
   calls, we conducted experiments with a carnivore-, snake- and raptor
   model. We also conducted playback experiments with mouse lemur alarm
   calls to characterize their function. In response to predator models,
   they exhibited a combination of anti-predator strategies: in response to
   carnivore and snake models, mouse lemurs monitored the predator,
   probably to assess the potential risk that emanates from the predator.
   In response to raptor models they behaved cryptically and exhibited
   freezing behaviour. All mouse lemurs, except one individual, did not
   alarm call in response to predator models. In addition, during playback
   experiments with alarm calls, recorded during real predator encounters,
   mouse lemurs did not emit alarm calls nor did they show any escape
   behaviour. Thus, as in other nocturnal primates/mammals, mouse lemurs do
   not seem to rely on routinely warning of conspecifics against nearby
   predators.},

Abstract = {Although parasites are important regulatory factors in animal
   populations, basic knowledge on their fauna in many vertebrate taxa is
   lacking. In particular, parasite infections of primate species have
   gained little attention. Here, I present data on the gastro-intestinal
   fauna of a population of wild red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus ruins;
   Primates: Lemuriformes) monitored over a total of 8 mo during 2
   consecutive field seasons in 2006 and 2007 in Kirindy Forest, western
   Madagascar. Using fecal samples for parasite analyses, I identified 10
   parasite species, including 6 nematodes (Lemuricola vauceli, Trichuris
   sp., 2 species of Callistoura, I trichostrongylid, and 1 strongyloid), 1
   anoplocephalid cestode, a dicrocoeliid trematode, as well as 2
   protozoans (Entamoeba sp. and Balantidium coli). The population in
   Kirindy Forest had the highest prevalence and number of parasite species
   ever recorded for species of lemurs. Additionally, prevalence of some
   parasite species differed between the social groups studied. These
   findings lead to 2 conclusions. First, it is important to extend a
   parasitological study to several social groups of a host population,
   since groups may differ in parasite fauna as a result of minor
   microclimatic or habitat parameters, and, second, short-term assessments
   of lemur health might underestimate the real parasite burden.},

Title = {Paleoenvironment of Ankilitelo Cave (late Holocene, southwestern
   Madagascar): implications for the extinction of giant lemurs},

Abstract = {Following human arrival, Madagascar suffered well-documented megafaunal
   extinctions and widespread deforestation. Although humans are widely
   considered to be the primary cause of the extinctions, the relative
   contributions of climate change and human activities to this ecological
   transformation remain uncertain. Reconstructing the habitats of the
   giant lemurs of Madagascar can provide key information for understanding
   the evolutionary mechanisms involved in their extinction. In this study,
   I present a faunal analysis of the subfossil assemblage from Ankilitelo
   Cave, southwestern Madagascar. This assemblage documents the latest
   known occurrence of five species of extinct giant lemur, in association
   with abundant well-preserved small mammal remains. I compared the small
   mammal fauna at Ankilitelo with 27 extant Malagasy mammal communities
   spanning the range of Madagascar's habitat types. Similarities in
   species composition between modern communities and Ankilitelo were
   assessed using cluster analysis. Ecological similarities were examined
   by assigning each species to dietary, locomotor, activity pattern, and
   body size categories. Multiple discriminant analysis was then used to
   classify Ankilitelo relative to modern habitat types in Madagascar,
   based on the ecological structure of the subfossil fauna. Results
   indicate that the habitat surrounding Ankilitelo during the late
   Holocene was similar to the succulent woodlands of modern southwestern
   Madagascar. This suggests that approximately 500 yr BP, these semi-arid
   habitats supported a subfossil lemur community that included the
   highly-suspensory Palaeopropithecus, and deliberate slow-climber
   Megaladapis, as well as Archaeolemur, Pachylemur, and Daubentonia
   robusta. In such environments, these giant lemurs would likely have been
   highly vulnerable to increasing human pressure in southwestern
   Madagascar. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Delimiting Species without Nuclear Monophyly in Madagascar's Mouse
   Lemurs},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {Background: Speciation begins when populations become genetically
   separated through a substantial reduction in gene flow, and it is at
   this point that a genetically cohesive set of populations attain the
   sole property of species: the independent evolution of a
   population-level lineage. The comprehensive delimitation of species
   within biodiversity hotspots, regardless of their level of divergence,
   is important for understanding the factors that drive the
   diversification of biota and for identifying them as targets for
   conservation. However, delimiting recently diverged species is
   challenging due to insufficient time for the differential evolution of
   characters-including morphological differences, reproductive isolation,
   and gene tree monophyly-that are typically used as evidence for
   separately evolving lineages.
   Methodology: In this study, we assembled multiple lines of evidence from
   the analysis of mtDNA and nDNA sequence data for the delimitation of a
   high diversity of cryptically diverged population-level mouse lemur
   lineages across the island of Madagascar. Our study uses a multi-faceted
   approach that applies phylogenetic, population genetic, and genealogical
   analysis for recognizing lineage diversity and presents the most
   thoroughly sampled species delimitation of mouse lemur ever performed.
   Conclusions: The resolution of a large number of geographically defined
   clades in the mtDNA gene tree provides strong initial evidence for
   recognizing a high diversity of population-level lineages in mouse
   lemurs. We find additional support for lineage recognition in the
   striking concordance between mtDNA clades and patterns of nuclear
   population structure. Lineages identified using these two sources of
   evidence also exhibit patterns of population divergence according to
   genealogical exclusivity estimates. Mouse lemur lineage diversity is
   reflected in both a geographically fine-scaled pattern of population
   divergence within established and geographically widespread taxa, as
   well as newly resolved patterns of microendemism revealed through
   expanded field sampling into previously poorly and well-sampled regions.},

Title = {Total Energy Expenditure and Body Composition in Two Free-Living
   Sympatric Lemurs},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Background: Evolutionary theories that account for the unusual
   socio-ecological traits and life history features of group-living
   prosimians, compared with other primates, predict behavioral and
   physiological mechanisms to conserve energy. Low energy output and
   possible fattening mechanisms are expected, as either an adaptive
   response to drastic seasonal fluctuations of food supplies in
   Madagascar, or persisting traits from previously nocturnal hypometabolic
   ancestors. Free ranging ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) and brown
   lemurs (Eulemur sp.) of southern Madagascar have different
   socio-ecological characteristics which allow a test of these theories:
   Both gregarious primates have a phytophagous diet but different
   circadian activity rhythms, degree of arboreality, social systems, and
   slightly different body size.
   Methodology and Results: Daily total energy expenditure and body
   composition were measured in the field with the doubly labeled water
   procedure. High body fat content was observed at the end of the rainy
   season, which supports the notion that individuals need to attain a
   sufficient physical condition prior to the long dry season. However,
   ring-tailed lemurs exhibited lower water flux rates and energy
   expenditure than brown lemurs after controlling for body mass
   differences. The difference was interpreted to reflect higher efficiency
   for coping with seasonally low quality foods and water scarcity. Daily
   energy expenditure of both species was much less than the field
   metabolic rates predicted by various scaling relationships found across
   mammals.
   Discussion: We argue that low energy output in these species is mainly
   accounted for by low basal metabolic rate and reflects adaptation to
   harsh, unpredictable environments. The absence of observed sex
   differences in body weight, fat content, and daily energy expenditure
   converge with earlier investigations of physical activity levels in
   ring-tailed lemurs to suggest the absence of a relationship between
   energy constraints and the evolution of female dominance over males
   among lemurs. Nevertheless, additional seasonal data are required to
   provide a definitive conclusion.},

   Baseline},
Booktitle = {MIND THE GAP: TRACING THE ORIGINS OF HUMAN UNIVERSALS},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {395-426},
Abstract = {Social behavior, culture, and cognition are domains where presumably
   most human universals exist. Identification of these derived human
   traits depends and relies on comparisons with other primates, notably
   chimpanzees. This approach can also be used to reconstruct primate and
   human behavioral evolution. Accordingly, traits found in both Homo and
   Pan can be inferred to have existed in their last common ancestor as
   well. By analogy, traits shared between humans and other primates can be
   traced back even further down on our family tree. Here, we look at the
   other side of human universals, i.e., behavioral and cognitive traits of
   the most basal living primates, which ought to represent the common
   primate legacy upon which later taxon-specific specializations were
   built. Specifically, we review studies investigating cognitive abilities
   and social behavior of the lemuriform primates of Madagascar. The
   Malagasy lemurs are particularly important for this purpose because they
   alone, among strepsirrhine primates, have evolved group-living, which
   characterizes most living haplorrhines. Even though lemurs have
   relatively smaller brains than New and Old World monkeys and great apes,
   their ability to solve problems that require technical intelligence is
   qualitatively on par with that of haplorrhines. In the domain of social
   intelligence, however, lemurs deviate from the better-known haplorrhine
   models (i.e., cercopithecines) in several respects. Most importantly,
   their behavioral strategies reflect an emphasis on within-group
   competition, rather than cooperation, which may represent lemur-specific
   adaptations to an ecologically unpredictable environment, rather than
   fundamental deficits in social intelligence. In any event, a broad
   comparative perspective including the best living models of the earliest
   gregarious primates can enrich reconstructions and other evolutionary
   analyzes of primate social behavior, including that of humans.},

Abstract = {The current range of the red ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra) population is
   primarily restricted to forests of the Masoala Peninsula on the
   northeastern coast of Madagascar. Whereas much of the peninsula is
   protected as Masoala National Park, parts of the forest are at risk from
   anthropogenic pressures and habitat fragmentation. We sampled 32
   individual red ruffed lemur from two sites: Ambatoledama (DAMA), a
   narrow forest corridor across an area of degraded habitat connecting
   larger blocks of forest in the northwestern reaches of the park, and
   Masiaposa (MAS) forest, a largely pristine forest on the lower western
   side of the peninsula. Population genetic parameters were estimated for
   these two populations employing 15 microsatellite loci derived from the
   V. variegata genome. We found that by exceeding the expected
   heterozygosity at mutation-drift equilibrium, the DAMA population has
   undergone a recent population bottleneck. Population structure analysis
   detected individuals harboring genotypic admixture of the DAMA genetic
   cluster in the MAS population, suggesting a possibility of unilateral
   gene flow or movement between these populations.},

Abstract = {Madagascar's diverse and mostly endemic fauna and flora suffer from
   recent landscape changes that are primarily caused by high levels of
   human activities. The loss and fragmentation of forest habitats are well
   known consequences of human activities. In this study, we investigate
   the effects of forest fragmentation on presence, abundance and genetic
   diversity in a larger-bodied lemur species, Lepilemur edwardsi, in
   northwestern Madagascar. In addition, we characterized the genetic
   differentiation among populations and demographic changes. We found L.
   edwardsi at only 13 (76.5\%) of 17 visited sites, I I of which were
   situated in the Ankarafantsika National Park (ANP). We captured between
   two and 17 individuals per site. We sequenced the mtDNA d-loop of all
   samples and genotyped 14 microsatellite loci in two exemplary
   populations for demographic analyses. A negative influence on forest
   fragmentation could be detected, since the fragments had a lower genetic
   diversity than sites in the ANP. Genetic differentiation between
   populations ranged from low to high but was almost always significant. A
   typical pattern of isolation-by-distance could not be detected and the
   data could rather be interpreted as results of random genetic drift. The
   data furthermore revealed signals of a demographic collapse of about two
   orders of magnitude in the two exemplary sites. This decline probably
   started during the last few hundred years of intensified human
   disturbances and population growth. Given the results of this study,
   urgent conservation actions are needed and should concentrate on an
   effective protection of the few remaining populations in order to ensure
   the long-term survival of L. edwardsi. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {P>I provide measurements of the gastrointestinal tract of a captive
   female Eulemur coronatus, obtained at necropsy, and describe its
   morphology. The small intestine, caecum and colon were short when
   compared with those of other lemur species. The ratio of intestine
   length to body length was low. Distinct sacculations were present in the
   caecum, but not in the colon. The results suggest that E. coronatus is
   able to digest a certain amount of structural polysaccharides as
   contained in plant cell wall. The main fermentation chamber seems to be
   the caecum. Its digestive morphology implies that E. coronatus relies on
   a diet higher in energy-rich cell contents than those of other lemur
   species of similar body size.},

Abstract = {Optimal group size and composition are determined by both the costs and
   benefits of group living for the group's members. Verreaux's sifakas
   (Propithecus verreauxi), a diurnal lemur, form multimale multifemale
   groups with the tendency toward even adult sex ratios despite a small
   average number of females per group. The unexpected presence of multiple
   adult males may be explained by tolerance of other group members if
   subordinate males provide benefits to the group that outweigh the costs
   associated with their presence. Results based on both demographic data
   collected over a 13-year period and behavioral observations suggest that
   Subordinate males provide no benefits in terms of infant survival and
   defense against group takeover by outside males. Although groups with
   more males are more likely to win intergroup encounters, subordinate
   males do not participate in these encounters more often than expected
   Subordinate males are not costly to other group members in terms of
   direct intragroup feeding competition, but aggression rates between
   dominant and immigrated subordinate males increase in the mating season.
   Even though subordinate males provide very few benefits to the group,
   they are not very costly either and thus may be tolerated by resident
   females and dominant males This tolerance may help to partially explain
   the tendency towards their unusual adult sex ratio. Am J Phys Anthropol

Abstract = {Studies on reproductive endocrinology in wild primate populations have
   greatly increased in the last decades owing to the development of
   noninvasive techniques that can be applied under field conditions.
   However, small-bodied nocturnal species are not well represented on the
   long list of primates surveyed in the wild, and reproductive inferences
   regarding these animals in their natural habitats have not benefited
   from direct observations of hormonal changes. We collected fecal samples
   from female brown mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus) in a southeastern
   rainforest of Madagascar in order to determine whether or not fecally
   excreted steroid levels show a consistent pattern of change during the
   reproductive season and are a useful complement to reproductive
   observations in wild-trapped individuals. Initial data show variation in
   reproductive hormone levels before and after estrus and estimated day of
   parturition. Elevated levels of excreted estradiol (E-2) were observed
   around the time of estrus, whereas high levels of fecal progesterone (P)
   were seen during later stages of pregnancy and around parturition. A
   more complete picture of reproductive profiles in female mouse lemurs,
   and how they may change over the life span, can be obtained if hormone
   analyses are used to supplement field observations. Am. J. Primatol.

Title = {Sociality, ecology, and relative brain size in lemurs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2009},

Abstract = {The social brain hypothesis proposes that haplorhine primates have
   evolved relatively large brains for their body size primarily as an
   adaptation for living in complex social groups. Studies that support
   this hypothesis have shown a strong relationship between relative brain
   size and group size in these taxa. Recent reports suggest that this
   pattern is unique to haplorhine primates; many nonprimate taxa do not
   show a relationship between group size and relative brain size. Rather,
   pairbonded social monogamy appears to be a better predictor of a large
   relative brain size in many nonprimate taxa. It has been suggested that
   haplorhine primates may have expanded the pairbonded relationship beyond
   simple dyads towards the evolution of complex social groups. We examined
   the relationship between group size, pairbonding, and relative brain
   size in a sample of 19 lemurs; strepsirrhine primates that last share a
   common ancestor with monkeys and apes approximately 75 Ma. First, we
   evaluated the social brain hypothesis, which predicts that species with
   larger social groups will have relatively larger brains. Secondly, we
   tested the pairbonded hypothesis, which predicts that species with a
   pairbonded social organization will have relatively larger brains than
   non-pairbonded species. We found no relationship between group size or
   pairbonding and relative brain size in lemurs. We conducted two further
   analyses to test for possible relationships between two nonsocial
   variables, activity pattern and diet, and relative brain size. Both diet
   and activity pattern are significantly associated with relative brain
   size in our sample. Specifically, frugivorous species have relatively
   larger brains than folivorous species, and cathemeral species have
   relatively larger brains than diurnal, but not nocturnal species. These
   findings highlight meaningful differences between Malagasy
   strepsirrhines and haplorhines, and between Malagasy strepsirrhines and
   nonprimate taxa, regarding the social and ecological factors associated
   with increases in relative brain size. The results suggest that factors
   such as foraging complexity and flexibility of activity patterns may
   have driven selection for increases in brain size in lemurs. (C) 2009

Abstract = {In the study of mammalian adaptation to the environment, teeth are of
   primary importance due to their role as one of the direct interaction
   points between an individual and its ecological Surroundings. Here,
   molar shape and function are investigated through traditional
   multivariate statistics and Thin-Plate Splines deformations to compare
   the relative location of lower first molar occlusal structures
   (protoconid, metaconid, hypoconid, entoconid, cristid obliqua, and
   protolophid) in modern lemurs, lorises, tarsiers, and a non-primate
   outgroup taxon (Tupaia). Results suggest that shape is based both on
   tooth size and dietary patterns. Small teeth tend to he short
   (anteroposteriorally) with wide talonids, whereas larger teeth are
   generally characterized as being long and narrow. In considering
   non-size related shape trends, frugivorous and graminivorous taxa
   generally exhibit a relatively buccal intersection of the cristid
   obliqua with the base of the protolophid, and a relatively
   ``perpendicular{''} position of the protolophid in relation to the
   anteroposterior axis of the tooth (defined as the axis connecting the
   protolophid and hypoconid). Morphological trends of folivores include a
   central (midline) position of the cristid obliqua-protolophid base
   intersection and an oblique angle of the protolophid. Insectivorous taxa
   (primate and non-primate) generally exhibit a central placement of the
   cristid obliqua-protolophid base intersection (as in folivores), along
   with a relatively perpendicular angle of the protolophid (as in
   frugivores). Omnivorous taxa exhibit shape patterns that are
   intermediate between these three former groups. This study pro vides a
   comparative baseline for the interpretation of morphological trends in
   fossil primate groups, particularly the Adapiformes. Anat Rec,

Abstract = {This study employs dental microwear texture analysis to reconstruct the
   diets of two families of subfossil lemurs from Madagascar, the
   archaeolemurids and megalaclapids. This technique is based on
   three-dimensional surface measurements utilizing a white-light confocal
   profiler and scale-sensitive fractal analysis. Data were recorded for
   six texture variables previously used successfully to distinguish
   between living primates with known dietary differences. Statistical
   analyses revealed that the archaeolemurids and megalaclapids have
   overlapping microwear texture signatures, suggesting that the two
   families occasionally depended on resources with similar mechanical
   properties. Even so. moderate variation in most attributes is evident,
   and results Suggest potential differences in the foods consumed by the
   two families. The microwear pattern for the megalaclapids indicates a
   preference for tougher foods, such as many leaves, while that of the
   archaeolemurids is consistent with the consumption of harder foods. The
   results also indicate some intraspecific differences among taxa within
   each family. This evidence suggests that the archaeolemurids and
   megalaclapids, like many living primates, likely consumed a variety of
   food types. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An index of coat condition can be a non-invasive tool for tracking
   health and stress at population level. Coat condition in ringtailed
   lemurs, Lemur catta, was recorded during September-November birth
   seasons of 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2001-2006 at Berenty Reserve,
   Madagascar. Condition was scored on a scale from 0: full, fluffy coat
   with guard hairs present, to 5: half or more of body hairless. Adult
   males did not differ overall from adult females. Coats were worse in
   adults than in 2-year-old subadults; 1-year-old juveniles were
   intermediate. Mothers and adult males lost coat condition as the season
   progressed: non-mother females maintained condition. Years 1999-2002
   scored better coats than either 1996-1997 or 2003-2006. Lemurs in high
   population density areas had worse coats than in natural forest, but
   tourist presence had less effect than density. Monitoring coat condition
   in an apparently healthy population reveals differences between
   population segments, and in a forest fragment with limited immigration
   or emigration it can track progressive changes, correcting impressions
   of progressive improvement or degradation over time. Above all it gives
   a baseline for response to climate changes or eventual pathology. Am. J.

Title = {Species delimitation in lemurs: multiple genetic loci reveal low levels
   of species diversity in the genus Cheirogaleus},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 4},
Abstract = {Background: Species are viewed as the fundamental unit in most
   subdisciplines of biology. To conservationists this unit represents the
   currency for global biodiversity assessments. Even though Madagascar
   belongs to one of the top eight biodiversity hotspots of the world, the
   taxonomy of its charismatic lemuriform primates is not stable. Within
   the last 25 years, the number of described lemur species has more than
   doubled, with many newly described species identified among the
   nocturnal and small-bodied cheirogaleids. Here, we characterize the
   diversity of the dwarf lemurs (genus Cheirogaleus) and assess the status
   of the seven described species, based on phylogenetic and population
   genetic analysis of mtDNA (cytb + cox2) and three nuclear markers
   (adora3, fiba and vWF).
   Results: This study identified three distinct evolutionary lineages
   within the genus Cheirogaleus. Population genetic cluster analyses
   revealed a further layer of population divergence with six distinct
   genotypic clusters.
   Conclusion: Based on the general metapopulation lineage concept and
   multiple concordant data sets, we identify three exclusive groups of
   dwarf lemur populations that correspond to three of the seven named
   species: C. major, C. medius and C. crossleyi. These three species were
   found to be genealogically exclusive in both mtDNA and nDNA loci and are
   morphologically distinguishable. The molecular and morphometric data
   indicate that C. adipicaudatus and C. ravus are synonymous with C.
   medius and C. major, respectively. Cheirogaleus sibreei falls into the
   C. medius mtDNA clade, but in morphological analyses the membership is
   not clearly resolved. We do not have sufficient data to assess the
   status of C. minusculus. Although additional patterns of population
   differentiation are evident, there are no clear subdivisions that would
   warrant additional specific status. We propose that ecological and more
   geographic data should be collected to confirm these results.},

Title = {The semicircular canal system and locomotion: The case of extinct
   lemuroids and lorisoids},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Paleontologists reconstruct the locomotor and postural behavior of
   extinct species by analogy with living forms and biomechanical analyses.
   In rare cases, behavioral evidence such as footprints can be used to
   confirm fossil-based reconstructions for predominantly terrestrial
   orders of mammals. For instance, the chalicothere prints from Laetoli
   show that these perissodactyls supported their body weight on the
   metacarpals, as previously reconstructed.' Unfortunately, primates are
   mostly arboreal and rarely leave footprints. The cercopithecid and
   hominin prints at Laetoli are a rare exception. We have recently shown
   that the semicircular canal system can be used to test and augment
   locomotor reconstructions based on postcranial material or to provide
   first estimations of locomotor behavior for taxa not known from the
   postcranium. Using a sample of modern primates, we have been able to
   demonstrate that the radii of curvature of the semicircular canals are
   significantly correlated with both body mass and agility of
   locomotion.(2) This paper reviews those results and examines the
   relationship between semicircular canal morphology and other evidence in
   efforts to reconstruct locomotor behavior in subfossil lemurs from the
   Holocene of Madagascar and fossil lorisoids from the Miocene of Africa.},

Abstract = {Chemical deterioration of teeth is common among modern humans, and has
   been suggested for some extinct primates. Dental erosion caused by
   acidic foods may also obscure microwear signals of mechanical food
   properties. Ring-tailed lemurs at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve
   (BMSR), Madagascar, display frequent severe tooth wear and subsequent
   tooth loss. In contrast, sympatric Verreaux's sifaka. display far less
   tooth wear and infrequent tooth loss, despite both species regularly
   consuming acidic tamarind fruit. We investigated the potential impact of
   dietary acidity on tooth wear, collecting data on salivary pH from both
   species, as well as salivary pH from ring-tailed lemurs at
   Tsimanampesotse National Park, Madagascar. We also collected salivary pH
   data from ring-tailed lemurs at the Indianapolis Zoo, none of which had
   eaten for at least 12 hr before data collection. Mean salivary pH for
   the BMSR ring-tailed lemurs (8.098, n = 41, SD = 0.550) was
   significantly more alkaline than Verreaux's sifaka. (7.481, n = 26, SD =
   0.458). The mean salivary pH of BMSR (8.098) and Tsimanampesotse (8.080,
   n = 25, SD = 0.746) ring-tailed lemurs did not differ significantly.
   Salivary pH for the Indianapolis Zoo sample (8.125, n = 16, SD = 0.289)
   did not differ significantly from either the BMSR or Tsimanampesotse
   ring-tailed lemurs, but was significantly more alkaline than the BMSR
   Verreaux's sifaka sample. Regardless of the time between feeding and
   collection of pH data (from several minutes to nearly 1 hr), salivary pH
   for each wild lemur was above the ``critical{''} pH of 5.5, below which
   enamel demineralization occurs. Thus, the high pH of lemur saliva
   suggests a strong buffering capacity, indicating the impact of acidic
   foods on dental wear is short-lived, likely having a limited effect.
   However, tannins in tamarind fruit may increase friction between teeth,
   thereby increasing attrition and wear in lemurs. These data also suggest
   that salivary pH varies between lemur species, corresponding to broad
   dietary categories.},

Abstract = {Seasonal dietary variations demonstrate the importance of certain plant
   parts during the year. A parallel analysis of their nutritional
   constituents provides further information on underlying patterns of
   consumption of the plant parts and the relative importance of key
   nutrients. I studied the diets of Lemur catta (ring-tailed lemurs) and
   Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi (sifakas), for 9 mo over a 13-mo period
   in the highly seasonal tropical dry forest site of Beza Mahafaly in
   southwestern Madagascar. I tested dietary plant parts for
   nutrients-protein, free amino acids, and sugars-and for 2 potential
   deterrents, phenolics and tannins, using plant extracts prepared in the
   field. I compared consumption of nutrients and secondary compounds
   throughout the year and between seasons. Nutrients are balanced
   throughout the year. The 2 lemur species do not appear nutrient-starved
   in either season, though actual quantities of nutrients and contributing
   food parts differ for each species. Lemur catta consumes high levels of
   sugar throughout the year, whereas Propithecus takes in higher levels of
   protein. The effects of phenolics and tannins are quantitative, and they
   appear to deter consumption of plant parts only past a certain
   threshold. Sifakas consume them in greater quantities than those of
   ring-tailed lemurs, which appear more sensitive to their effects.
   Sifakas may have a higher tolerance for secondary plant metabolites,
   which is consistent with reports for other folivores. The overall
   stability of nutrients throughout the year indicates no lean period that
   coincides with the decline in food abundance during the dry season,
   though actual caloric intake probably decreases.},

Abstract = {Suitable sleeping sites as potentially restricted resources are
   suggested to shape sociality in primates. We investigated sleeping site
   ecology of a rain-forest dwelling sportive lemur in eastern Madagascar
   for the first time. Using radiotelemetry, we characterized the type,
   quality and usage of sleeping sites as well as social sleeping habits of
   11 focal individuals of the weasel sportive lemur (Lepilemur mustelinus)
   during the dry and the onset of the rainy season. Morphometric
   measurements provided additional information. The sexes showed an
   unusual sexual dimorphism for primates. Males and females did not differ
   in body length, but females surpassed males in body mass suggesting
   female dominance. Both sexes used dense vegetation and holes in hollow
   trees high above the ground as shelters for sleeping during the day. No
   sex difference in the quality of tree holes was found, but focal
   individuals used tree holes more often than open sleeping sites in dense
   vegetation. Both sexes showed high sleeping site fidelity limited to two
   to six different sites that they used primarily solitarily. The results
   imply that suitable sleeping sites are limited and survival of this
   species will strongly depend on the availability of mature rain forests
   with suitable hollow trees. Furthermore, these findings provide evidence
   of a solitary sleeping and ranging system in this rain-forest dwelling
   sportive lemur with suitable sleeping sites as defendable resources.},

Abstract = {Objective-To assess serum iron and ferritin concentrations, total
   iron-binding capacity, and transferrin saturation as indicators of iron
   metabolic status in 3 genera of lemurs and determine whether these
   variables are useful for screening for iron overload.
   Design-Cross-sectional study.
   Animals-11 ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta), 11 black lemurs (Eulemur
   macaco macaco), and 11 red-ruffed lemurs (Varecia rubra).
   Procedures-Blood samples were collected weekly for 3 weeks and assayed
   for serum iron and ferritin concentrations and total iron-binding
   capacity. Liver biopsy specimens were evaluated histologically and
   assayed for total iron, nonheme iron, and trace mineral concentrations.
   Deposition of iron was scored on Prussian blue-stained slides.
   Results-Hepatic iron content ranged from 497 to 12,800 mu g/g dry weight
   (median, 2,165 mu g/g). Differences were seen in mean hepatic iron
   content across genera, with ruffed lemurs having the highest
   concentrations and ring-tailed lemurs having the lowest. Iron
   accumulation in the liver was mild, and cellular pathologic changes
   associated with iron storage disease were not detected in any lemur.
   Ferritin concentration was the only variable that correlated
   significantly with hepatic iron content in all 3 genera of lemurs;
   however, both transferrin saturation and serum iron concentration were
   correlated with hepatic iron concentration in ring-tailed and ruffed
   lemurs.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Serum ferritin concentration was the
   only variable that was consistently correlated with hepatic iron content
   in all 3 genera. Mean hepatic iron content varied across genera,
   suggesting that the propensity for lemurs to develop iron overload in
   captivity may vary across taxa.},

Abstract = {To better understand the relation between form and function in the
   complex olfactory communication system of the ringtailed lemur (Lemur
   catta), we integrated observational, experimental, and chemical
   approaches applied to a population of semi free-ranging animals at the
   Duke Lemur Center in Durham, North Carolina. Our aim was to examine
   sex-role reversal in the expression and function of scent marking and
   unravel the contribution of multimodal components of information
   transfer, with the unifying framework for all three avenues of our
   research being that multiplicity of form implies multiplicity of
   function.},

Abstract = {Comparative genome sequencing projects are providing insight into
   aspects of genome biology that raise new questions and challenge
   existing paradigms. Placement in the phylogenetic tree can often be a
   major determinant of which organism to choose for study. Lemurs hold a
   key position at the base of the primate evolutionary tree and will be
   highly informative for the genomics community by offering comparisons of
   primate-specific characteristics and processes. Combining research in
   chromosome evolution, genome evolution and behavior with lemur
   comparative genomic sequencing will offer insights into many levels of
   primate evolution. We discuss the current state of lemur cytogenetic and
   phylogenetic analyses, and suggest how focusing more genomic efforts on
   lemurs will be beneficial to understanding human and primate evolution,
   as well as disease, and will contribute to conservation efforts.},

Abstract = {Mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) are the world's smallest primates and
   endemic to Madagascar. Several recent taxonomic revisions resulted in an
   extraordinary increase of recognized species. What still was considered
   as being two species at the beginning of the 20th century is currently
   recognized as 12 taxa. Based on fur coloration pattern, they can be
   divided into grayish and reddish forms. Two major models have been
   proposed to explain the extensive speciation events in the Malagasy
   fauna. The best known suggests that major rivers and mountains combine
   to act as effective barriers to gene flow and thereby facilitate
   allopatric speciation processes. A more recent model used an analysis of
   watersheds in the context of Quaternary climatic shifts to explain the
   process of explosive speciation on the island. We tested these two
   models by covering the areas between all major rivers (n = 8) in
   northwestern and northern Madagascar. Mouse lemurs were systematically
   caught, sampled and morphometrically characterized in 25 sites (with
   2-49 individuals per site and species). A complete phylogeny was
   constructed on the basis of the sequences of three mitochondrial loci
   (in total 1296 bp). The phylogenetic data revealed a previously unknown
   biodiversity with three new mouse lemur species among the reddish forms,
   each having a very small distribution, i.e., being restricted to only
   one Inter-River-System (IRS). Morphometric analyses underlined their
   distinctiveness and a brief formal species description is provided. In
   contrast to the reddish forms, grayish forms have a very low species
   diversity coupled with broad distributions that cover more than one IRS.
   These differences among the species are discussed as outcome of
   divergent colonization scenarios. Elements of both biogeographic models
   are combined in a new hypothesis that aims to explain the speciation
   process leading to the present distribution of mouse lemurs in
   Madagascar. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Molecular phylogeny and taxonomic revision of the sportive lemurs
   (Lepilemur, Primates)},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {6},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {Background: The number of species within the Malagasy genus Lepilemur
   and their phylogenetic relationships is disputed and controversial. In
   order to establish their evolutionary relationships, a comparative
   cytogenetic and molecular study was performed. We sequenced the complete
   mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (1140 bp) from 68 individuals
   representing all eight sportive lemur species and most major
   populations, and compared the results with those obtained from
   cytogenetic studies derived from 99 specimens.
   Results: Interspecific genetic variation, diagnostic characters and
   significantly supported phylogenetic relationships were obtained from
   the mitochondrial sequence data and are in agreement with cytogenetic
   information. The results confirm the distinctiveness of Lepilemur
   ankaranensis, L. dorsalis, L. edwardsi, L. leucopus, L. microdon, L.
   mustelinus, L. ruficaudatus and L. septentrionalis on species level.
   Additionally, within L. ruficaudatus large genetic differences were
   observed among different geographic populations. L. dorsalis from
   Sahamalaza Peninsula and from the Ambanja/Nosy Be region are
   paraphyletic, with the latter forming a sister group to L. ankaranensis.
   Conclusion: Our results support the classification of the eight major
   sportive lemur taxa as independent species. Moreover, our data indicate
   further cryptic speciation events within L. ruficaudatus and L.
   dorsalis. Based on molecular data we propose to recognize the sportive
   lemur populations from north of the Tsiribihina River, south of the
   Betsiboka River, and from the Sahamalaza Peninsula, as distinct species.},

Abstract = {Though females are generally more selective in mate choice, males may
   also derive reproductive benefits from exercising mate selectivity if
   one or more factors limit male reproductive success and females differ
   in reproductive potential. I used male mating effort as a proxy for male
   mate choice in ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). I calculated mating
   effort as the rate of male-male agonism during each female's estrous
   period 30 min before and 30 min after the first and last mountings with
   intromission. I collected data on 1 free-ranging Lemur catta troop
   during 2 consecutive breeding seasons on St. Catherines Island, USA. In
   both yrs, male mating effort differed significantly among troop females
   once I adjusted male-male agonistic rates to reflect agonistic
   intensity, and I corrected for the number of observed mates per female
   (2000: chi(2) = 27.43, df = 3, p < 0.0001; 2001: chi(2) = 21.10, df = 3,
   p < 0.001). Results strongly suggest male mate choice. Contrary to
   expectation, males did not expend the greatest mating effort for females
   with the highest dominance status nor the highest reproductive success.
   Males preferred females that either: (1) belonged to the age class in
   which fecundity and infant survival is the highest at this site (4-9
   yrs), or 2) were older females (>= 10 yrs) with high reproductive
   success. Female reproductive potential appears to be an important
   variable determining male mating effort in Lemur catta.},

Title = {Dental development in Megaladapis edwardsi (Primates, Lemuriformes):
   Implications for understanding life history variation in subfossil

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {49},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Teeth grow incrementally and preserve within them a record of that
   incremental growth in the form of microscopic growth lines. Studying
   dental development in extinct and extant primates, and its relationship
   to adult brain and body size as well as other life history and
   ecological parameters (e.g., diet, somatic growth rates, gestation
   length, age at weaning), holds the potential to yield unparalleled
   insights into the life history profiles of fossil primates.
   Here, we address the absolute pace of dental development in Megaladapis
   edwardsi, a giant extinct lemur of Madagascar. By examining the
   microstructure of the first and developing second molars in a juvenile
   individual, we establish a chronology of molar crown development for
   this specimen (M-1 CFT = 1.04 years; M-1 CFT = 1.42 years) and determine
   its age at death (1.39 years). Microstructural data on prenatal M, crown
   formation time allow us to calculate a minimum gestation length of 0.54
   years for this species. Postnatal crown and root formation data allow us
   to estimate its age at M-1 emergence (similar to 0.9 years) and to
   establish a minimum age for M-2 emergence (> 1.39 years). Finally, using
   reconstructions or estimates (drawn elsewhere) of adult body mass, brain
   size, and diet in Megaladapis, as well as the eruption sequence of its
   permanent teeth, we explore the efficacy of these variables in
   predicting the absolute pace of dental development in this fossil
   species. We test competing explanations of variation in crown formation
   timing across the order Primates. Brain size is the best single
   predictor of crown formation time in primates, but other variables help
   to explain the variation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In order to remain stable, dispersed social groups have to solve two
   fundamental problems: the coordination of movement and cohesiveness
   within a group and the spacing between the groups. Here, we investigate
   mechanisms involved in intra-group coordination and inter-group spacing
   using the golden brown mouse lemur, Microcebus ravelobensis, as a model
   for a nocturnal, solitary foraging mammal with a dispersed social
   system. By means of radiotelemetry and bioacoustics we studied the
   olfactory and vocal behaviour during nocturnal dispersal and reunion of
   five sleeping groups.
   All groups used 3-17 sleeping sites exclusively, suggesting a sleeping
   site-related territoriality and competition for them. The occurrence of
   olfactory and vocal behaviour showed an asymmetrical temporal
   distribution. Whereas marking behaviour was observed exclusively during
   dispersal, a particular call type, the trill, was used by all groups
   during reunions. Interestingly, these trills carried group-specific
   signatures.
   Our findings provide the first empirical evidence for nocturnal primates
   in a natural environment that olfactory signals represent an important
   mechanism to regulate the distribution of different groups in space,
   whereas acoustic signals control intra-group cohesion and coordination.},

Abstract = {The living Malagasy lemurs constitute a spectacular radiation of >50
   species that are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor that
   colonized Madagascar in the early Tertiary period. Yet, at least 15
   additional Malagasy primate species, some of which were relative giants,
   succumbed to extinction within the past 2,000 years. Their existence in
   Madagascar is recorded predominantly in its Holocene subfossil record.
   To rigorously test the hypothesis that all endemic Malagasy primates
   constitute a monophyletic group and to determine the evolutionary
   relationships among living and extinct taxa, we have conducted an
   ancient DNA analysis of subfossil species. A total of nine subfossil
   individuals from the extinct genera Palaeopropithecus and Megaladapis
   yielded amplifiable DNA. Phylogenetic analysis of cytochrome b sequences
   derived from these subfossils corroborates the monophyly of endemic
   Malagasy primates. Our results support the close relationship of sloth
   lemurs to living indriids, as has been hypothesized on morphological
   grounds. In contrast, Megaladapis does not show a sister-group
   relationship with the living genus Lepilemur. Thus, the classification
   of the latter in the family Megaladapidae is misleading. By correlating
   the geographic location of subfossil specimens with relative
   amplification success, we reconfirm the global trend of increased
   success rates of ancient DNA recovery from nontropical localities.},

Abstract = {R-banding chromosomal studies of 21 species of Lemuriformes allowed us
   to reconstruct the presumed ancestral karyotype of all the Lemuriformes
   except for Daubentoniidae and permitted the construction of their
   phylogenetic tree. Chromosome painting with fluorescently labeled
   heterologous DNA probes permitted comparative chromosome maps to be
   established. The Zoo-FISH method was used to reassess the karyotypes of
   22 species or subspecies. While our results largely confirm the previous
   reconstruction of the ancestral karyotype, they resulted in a
   modification of the previously established phylogenetic tree. The
   Daubentoniidae emerged first followed by the divergence of the families
   Cheirogaleidae, Indriidae, Lepilemuridae and Lemuridae. Eight chromosome
   rearrangements occurred in all Lemuriformes except for Daubentoniidae in
   the common trunk. The present findings do not allow us to propose the
   occurrence of any rearrangement common to Daubentoniidae and other
   Lemuriformes, and probably other Prosimii. Conserved syntenies
   previously described in various mammalian orders were also conserved,
   while others were specific to the Lemuriformes. Copyright (C) 2005 S.

Abstract = {The lemurs of Madagascar are a unique radiation of primates that show an
   extraordinary diversity of lifestyles, morphologies and behaviours.
   However, very little is known about the relative antiquity of lemuriform
   clades due to the lack of terrestrial fossils for the Tertiary of
   Madagascar. Here, we employ a Bayesian method to estimate divergence
   dates within the lemuriform radiation using several unlinked gene loci
   and multiple fossil calibrations outside the lemuriform clade. Two
   mitochondrial genes (cytochrome oxidase II and cytochrome b), two
   nuclear introns (transthyretin intron 1 and von Willebrand factor gene
   intron 11) and one nuclear exon (interphotoreceptor retinoid binding
   protein, exon 1) are used in separate and combined analyses. The genes
   differ in taxon sampling and evolutionary characteristics but produce
   congruent date estimates. Credibility intervals narrow considerably in
   combined analyses relative to separate analyses due to the increased
   amount of data. We also test the relative effects of multiple vs. single
   calibration points, finding that, when only single calibration points
   are employed, divergence dates are systematically underestimated. For
   the mitochondrial DNA data set, we investigate the effects of sampling
   density within the mouse lemur radiation (genus Microcebus). When only
   two representative species are included, estimated dates throughout the
   phylogeny are more recent than with the complete-species sample, with
   basal nodes less affected than recent nodes. The difference appears to
   be due to the manner in which priors on node ages are constructed in the
   two analyses. In nearly all analyses, the age of the lemuriform clade is
   estimated to be approximately 62-65 Ma, with initial radiation of mouse
   lemurs and true lemurs (genus Eulemur) occurring approximately 8-12 Ma.
   The antiquity of the mouse lemur radiation is surprising given the near
   uniform morphology among species. Moreover, the observation that mouse
   lemurs and true lemurs are of similar ages suggests discrepancies in
   rates of morphological, behavioural and physiological evolution in the
   two clades, particularly with regard to characteristics of sexual
   signalling. These differences appear to correlate with the nocturnal vs.
   diurnal lifestyles, respectively, of these two primate groups.},

Abstract = {The introduction of Eulemur fulvus in 1975 into the Berenty Reserve and
   their recent attainment of population densities comparable to those of
   Lemur catta led us to analyze food partitioning among the 3 large
   prosimian species in the gallery forest. We assessed the diets of
   ring-tailed lemurs ( Lemur catta), brown lemurs ( Eulemur fulvus) and
   sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) from food intake measurements during 3
   successive short-term studies. All species exhibited marked seasonal
   changes in their major food categories. Dietary overlap was very high
   between ring-tailed lemurs and brown lemurs during 2 of 3 seasons,
   including the middle of the dry season. During the latter period,
   Eulemur appeared to compensate for a low quality diet by increasing the
   amount of food eaten. In contrast, Lemur fed on lower amounts of food
   and seemed more efficient at coping with fibrous plant materials. There
   is low dietary overlap of Lemur catta and Eulemur fulvus versus
   Propithecus, which exhibit by far the highest dietary diversity of the 3
   species. We discuss sustainable coexistence among them, based on
   respective dietary adaptations and potential for dietary flexibility.},

Abstract = {Masculinization of female genitalia and female intersexual dominance
   distinguish spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) and Malagasy primates
   (Lemuriformes) from most other mammals. An unusual prenatal endocrine
   environment has been proposed to proximately underlie the development of
   these traits in hyenas. To examine whether female dominance and genital
   masculinization are similarly enhanced by the prenatal environment in
   lemurid primates, we measured androgen and estrogen excretion in
   pregnant wild redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus). Our results
   showed that estrogen levels during the second phase of gestation were
   much higher in females carrying a male fetus than in female-carrying
   mothers. This may indicate the onset of testicular activity in male
   fetuses, because androgens of fetal origin are aromatized to maternal
   estrogens. Levels of androgen excretion were similar in all mothers
   regardless of the `fetus' sex, which may suggest that
   androgen-independent mechanisms also contribute to female
   masculinization. The much higher androgen/estrogen ratio in
   female-carrying mothers indicates that relative, rather than absolute,
   prenatal steroid concentrations may play a role in female
   masculinization.},

Year = {2003},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Over 15 field seasons (1987-2001), we collected census and life-history
   data on a population of individually identified ring-tailed lemurs at
   the Beza Mahafaly Reserve, Madagascar. No significant difference was
   found in population size over the study period, though a marked decline
   in the population occurred following a 2-year drought. The population
   rebounded rapidly after the immediate postdrought period. There was
   nearly a complete replacement of individuals over the study period.
   Average group size is 11.5 animals, and adult male to female sex ratio
   is 0.92. Most females reproduce annually, and the average fecundity rate
   is 84.3\%. The greatest variability in fecundity is found among old
   females. We suggest that ring-tailed lemur females follow an ``income
   breeding{''} strategy, i.e., females use maximum resources during
   reproduction rather than relying on fat stores, as do ``capital
   breeders.{''} Infant mortality to 1 year of age in a nondrought year is
   52\%, higher than infant mortality in small to medium-sized anthropoids.
   The oldest known female was 18 years old in 2001. We suggest that 18-20
   years may represent the maximum life-span for wild ring-tailed lemurs.
   Because males regularly emigrate from the population, we have no data
   regarding male life-span; however, there is some indication that males
   do not survive as long as females. Group fission has occurred three
   times: twice from one parent group living in the driest area of the
   reserve, with the most dispersed food resources. We suggest that the
   reproductive strategy that has evolved in this species, wherein females
   reproduce early in life and annually until old age, is a response to the
   unusual climate and environmental conditions under which Lemur catta has
   evolved. Am J Phys Anthropol 120: 182-194, 2003. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {Paleontological expeditions to Madagascar over the past two decades have
   yielded large quantities of bones of extinct lemurs. These include
   abundant post-cranial and cranial remains of new species belonging to a
   group of giant extinct lemurs that we have called sloth lemurs due to
   their remarkable postcranial convergence with arboreal sloths. New
   fossils have come from a variety of locations in Madagascar, including
   caves in the Northwest (Anjohibe) and the Ankarana Massif, located in
   the extreme north, as well as pits in the karstic plains near Toliara in
   southwestern Madagascar. The most spectacular of these is the extremely
   deep pit (>100 m) called Ankilitelo, the ``place of the three kily
   trees.{''} These new materials provide insights into the adaptive
   diversity and evolution of sloth lemurs. New carpal and pedal bones, as
   well as vertebrae and other portions of the axial skeletons, allow
   better reconstruction of the positional behavior of these animals. New
   analytical tools have begun to unlock the secrets of life-history
   adaptations of the Palaeopropithecidae, making explicit exactly what
   they had in common with their relatives, the Indriidae. Paleoecological
   research has elucidated the contexts in which they lived and the likely
   causes of their disappearance.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to assess the relative importance of food
   availability and its quality for the spatial distribution of a
   folivorous lemur species, Lepilemur ruficaudatus, from the highly
   seasonal dry deciduous forest of Madagascar. Males and females of this
   species showed opposite changes of body mass and body condition during
   the dry and the wet season. Male body mass declined during the dry
   season that coincides with mating, while female body mass remained
   constant, During the wet season that coincides with lactation, female
   body mass declined but male body mass increased. This indicates that
   changes in body mass are not linked as much to environmental seasonality
   as to mating and reproduction. The distribution of L. ruficaudatus was
   most significantly related to the spatial distribution of leaf protein
   during the wet season. Neither the availability nor the chemical
   composition of leaves eaten during the dry season affected the spatial
   distribution of L. ruficaudatus. These findings are consistent with
   hypotheses that constraints are most severe during the times of
   lactation and weaning and that distributions of primates reflect their
   food requirements in order to optimize their reproductive success. They
   are inconsistent with the idea that the lean dry season is the most
   stressful time of year for lemurs in energetic or nutritive terms.},

   on general aspects of the biology of Cheirogaleus were lacking until the
   late 1990s, when two field studies on C. medius were carried out at

   Forest in western Madagascar. While there is still only sparse
   information on the biology of C. major, our knowledge of C. medius has
   increased significantly in the last several years. Here, we present a
   summary of what is known to date about the biology of the fat-tailed

Title = {Phylogenetic relationships among the Malagasy lemuriforms (Primates :

Abstract = {Numerous phylogenetic hypotheses have been advanced for the Malagasy
   lemuriform radiation, drawing on data from morphology, physiology,
   behaviour and molecular genetics. Almost all possible relationships have
   been proposed, and most nodes have been contested. We present a
   phylogenetic analysis, using several analytical methods, of a partial
   sequence from the 12S rRNA mitochondrial gene. This gene codes for the
   small ribosomal subunit, and functional constraints require that the
   secondary structure of the molecule is strongly conserved, which in turn
   exerts constraints on the primary sequence structure. Although previous
   studies have suggested a very wide range of phylogenetic applicability
   for this molecule, our results indicate that it is most useful in
   strepsirrhine primates for estimating relationships among genera within
   families and among relatively recently diverged families (mean sequence
   divergence about 11\%). Relationships among families separated by larger
   genetic distances (>12\% divergence; e.g. Cheirogaleidae,
   Daubentoniidae, Megaladapidae) are difficult to resolve consistently.
   Our data show strong support for an Indridae-Lemuridae sister group and
   for monophyly of the Lemuridae with Varecia as the sister to all other
   lemurids. They also support, albeit less strongly, sister group
   relationships between Lemur and Hapalemur within the Lemuridae and
   between Propithecus and Avahi in the Indridae. (C) 2001 The Linnean

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Recently discovered wrist bones of the Malagasy subfossil lemurs
   Babakotia radofilai, Palaeopropithecus ingens, Mesopropithecus
   dolichobrachion, and Megaladapis madagascariensis shed new light on the
   postcranial morphologies and positional behaviors that characterized
   these extinct primates. Wrist bones of P. ingens resemble those of
   certain modern hominoids in having a relatively enlarged ulnar head and
   dorsally extended articular surface on the hamate, features related to a
   large range of rotation at the inferior radioulnar and midcarpal joints.
   The scaphoid of P. ingens is also similar to that of the extant tree
   sloth Choloepus in having an elongate, palmarly directed tubercle
   forming a deep radial margin of the carpal tunnel for the passage of
   large digital flexors. In (contrast, wrist remains of Megaladapis
   edwardsi and M. madagascariensis exhibit traits observed in the hands of
   extant pronograde, arboreal primates; these include a dorsopalmarly
   expanded pisiform and well-developed ``spiral{''} facet on the hamate.
   Moreover Megaladapis spp. and Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion possess
   bony tubercles (e.g., scaphoid tubercle and hamate hamulus) forming the
   carpal tunnel that are relatively similar in length to those, of modern
   pronograde lemurs. Babakotia and Mesopropithecus differ from Megaladapis
   in exhibiting features of the midcarpal joint related to frequent
   supination and radioulnar deviation of the hand characteristic of
   animals that use vertical and quadrumanous climbing in their foraging
   behaviors. Comparative analysis of subfossil lemur wrist morphology
   complements and expands upon prior inferences based on other regions of
   the postcranial skeleton, and suggests a considerable degree of
   locomotor and postural heterogeneity among these recently extinct
   primates. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

Title = {Sociality in the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) in northwestern

Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-40},

Abstract = {The mating system and social organization of the gray mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus) was investigated in two three-month field studies
   (covering a period before, during, and after the first mating season) in
   Ampijoroa, northwestern Madagascar. The spatial and temporal
   distribution of the sexes within a population was studied using
   mark/recapture techniques and radiotelemetry to assess possible contest
   or scramble competition between the males. Sociality was inferred from
   the occurrence and probability of nocturnal social encounters, the
   temporal stability of daily sleeping groups, and nocturnal ranging
   patterns of co-sleepers. Males and females were evenly distributed in
   the study area wit hin a network of highly overlapping home ranges. No
   indications were found for the spatial monopolization of the females by
   certain dominant males. Males and females had spatial access to several
   potential mates; the mating system is therefore characterized as a
   multi-male/multi-female system. Male home range sizes increased during
   the first mating season, which was interpreted as an indicator for
   scramble competition between the males. Competitive mate searching,
   sperm competition, and temporary mate guarding as well as female mate
   choice are suggested as the most probable reproductive strategies. Over
   the course of the study the animals lived continually within the study
   area, and most females formed stable individualized sleeping
   associations. Females that slept together shared a higher percentage of
   their home range than did females that slept at different sites. It is
   suggested that this network of social relationships should be described
   as a dispersed but individualized neighborhood. Am. J. Primatol.

Abstract = {Infant killing by primates is highly controversial. Sexual selection of
   infanticidal males has been disputed especially for seasonally breeding
   species, in which death of an infant does not advance conception of the
   next infant. We report attacks, infants found wounded: and predation in
   seasonally breeding Eulemur and Lemur at Berenty: Beta Mahafaly and Duke
   University Primate Center, and review cases seen elsewhere. Observed
   attacks leading to wounds or death conservatively total twelve by
   extratroop males, two by troop males, and seven by troop females.
   Eulemur ave occasional vertebrate predators, whose prey includes infant
   Lemur catta. Wounds inflicted by lemurs are usually abdominal canine
   slashes or bites to the head with rare eating, a pattern distinct front
   carnivore and raptor kills. Infant killing as inferred front corpses is
   more frequent than previously thought, but still rare. Adaptive
   advantages of killing plausibly include eliminating resource competitors
   of females, and sexual selection on males.},

Abstract = {In order to classify trees in the Lokobe Forest, Nosy Be, as dispersed,
   possibly dispersed, or not dispersed by Black Lemurs (Eulemur macaco),
   two Black Lemur groups were habituated and observed during the day and
   night for all months of the year (total 1219 hours). When fruits were
   eaten, the species was identified, and the maturity of the fruit and
   treatment of the seeds noted. Black Lemur droppings were searched for
   seeds: these were identified and signs of damage noted. Species that had
   ripe fruit that were not eaten by the Black Lemur were also identified,
   as were fleshy fruited species that produced little or no ripe fruits
   during the study. Other frugivores feeding on the fruits of black
   lemur-dispersed species were also noted. In order to estimate the
   proportion of tree species, tree trunks, and trunk basal area in the
   Lokobe Forest dispersed, possibly dispersed, and not dispersed by Black
   Lemurs, plots were installed in Lokobe's two forest types and the trees
   they enclosed were identified and their dbh measured. For the slope
   forest Black Lemurs dispersed 57\% of the represented tree species, 71\%
   of the represented tree trunks, and 73\% of the represented trunk basal
   area. For the ridge forest these values were 49\%, 76\%, and 88\%
   respectively. Only four of the 38 black lemur-dispersed species had
   fruits that were also eaten by other frugivore species. These results
   show that the Black Lemur is very important for seed dispersal in Lokobe
   Forest.},

Abstract = {Cathemeral activity, which is defined by sequences of activity bouts and
   resting phases throughout the 24 hour cycle, is rare among primates but
   common among group-living lemurs. The proximate and ultimate causes and
   mechanisms underlying this activity pattern are still obscure. One group
   of Red-fronted Brown Lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus) was therefore
   observed in Kirindy Forest/CFPF for a total of 384 hours between March
   and June 1996 to investigate potential causes and correlates of their
   activity. Observations were equally distributed between diurnal and
   nocturnal activity cycles and intensified around periods of full and new
   moon. We found that Kirindy Red-fronted Brown Lemurs exhibited
   cathemeral activity throughout the study period and documented a
   significant increase of nocturnal and a concomitant decrease of diurnal
   activity during the transition between the wet and dry season (i.e., in
   April-May). Intensity and duration of activity were dependent upon lunar
   phase, due to a significant increase in activity during the nights of
   full moon. Furthermore, a balance between diurnal and nocturnal activity
   levels was observed. The animals moved on average 989 m during the day
   and 749 m at night within their 20.5 ha home-range. Distance traveled at
   night increased significantly during the dry season and nocturnal
   activity was also negatively correlated with minimum temperature.
   Red-fronted Brown Lemurs and their feeding patches were located
   significantly higher above ground at night. Considering that during the
   dry season less cover is provided by vegetation, these results suggest
   that the animals avoided diurnal exposure in the canopy and compensated
   for it with an increase of nocturnal foraging, especially during a full
   moon. Minimizing predation risks and thermoregulation benefits may
   therefore be among the main determinants of this behavioral strategy.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to describe energy expenses of free ranging
   Lepilemur ruficaudatus during the dry season in the deciduous forest of
   western Madagascar. Since all lemur species measured so far have had
   very low resting metabolic rates (RMR) and some lemur species can go
   into daily or prolonged torpor, the question was, whether or not resting
   metabolic rates can be used to predict field metabolic rates (FMR) in
   lemurs. Doubly-labeled water measurements of FMR in 11 free-ranging L.
   ruficaudatus showed that these animals had FMR of about 65.6\% of the
   values expected for FMR of eutherian herbivores of similar body mass
   (mean mass = 723 g). FR IR was on average 2.6-3.1 times higher than RMR
   that had been measured previously as 63.6\% of the expected value for
   RMR of eutherian mammals of similar body mass. The ratio of FMR/RMR
   matches the ratio found in other eutherian mammals and is consistent
   with the idea that FMR is a constant multiple of RMR for eutherian
   mammals over a wide range of body mass. FMR augmented with increasing
   range size. The present data do not provide evidence that the costs of
   locomotion were energetically limiting for L. ruficaudatus.},

Abstract = {Lemurs are the best known Malagasy wildlife, attracting international
   attention to Madagascar's unique biodiversity and to the ecological
   changes that threaten their existence. Lemurs have been the underlying
   impetus for the creation of some of Madagascar's protected areas, which
   aim to conserve entire forest ecosystems. The presence of rare lemurs
   has drawn researchers, funding, and conservation measures to certain
   areas. Lemurs are being used as indicator species for ecological
   monitoring. Lemurs are also prime attractions for visitors, thus making
   a major economic contribution to a growing tourist industry and,
   potentially, to the future maintenance of protected areas. However,
   international and national support is insufficient to ensure
   conservation as local people strive to maintain their livelihoods. The
   Black Lemur Forest Project, Pare Ivoloina's environmental education
   center, Pare Botanique et Zoologique de Tsimbazaza and Jersey Wildlife
   Preservation Trust's Project Alaotra, demonstrate that lemurs can
   provide an effective focus for education and awareness programs at the
   local level leading to community-based conservation initiatives.},

Abstract = {The strictly nocturnal dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus) are extraordinary
   among primates in showing extensive torpor phases during the austral
   winter, which is thought to be an adaptation to seasonal variation in
   food availability. The Fat-tailed Dwarf Lemur (C. medius) is found
   throughout the west and south of Madagascar and enters torpor for six to
   eight months. Such a long period of dormancy may influence their social
   organization. A 20-month field Study carried out at the Station
   Forestiure d'Ampijoroa revealed a monogamous social pattern for C.
   medius.
   Data from this study are presented on group composition, sleeping
   associations, and home range organization over two seasons in order to
   elucidate the basis of C. medius' unusual social organization. All
   studied groups contained one adult pair and their offspring from one or
   more birth seasons. Members of a group regularly sleep together, which
   might be an important means of social contact. In groups containing more
   than one offspring, brothers and sisters had the closest relationship.
   The adult pair remain together within the same home range for more than
   one season and presumably for life. Subsequently, some hypotheses about
   when monogamy should evolve are discussed.},

Abstract = {On the basis of previous work on the food preferences of Ring-tailed
   Lemurs (Lemur catta) with respect to habitat composition, there is good
   evidence that the distribution of plant resources affects the social
   dispersion pattern of this species. In addition, females have feeding
   priority. In order to understand the relationships between social
   organization of L. catta and food intake, the feeding habits of males
   and females were studied by means of focal animal sampling at the
   Berenty Reserve. The number of troop members feeding in the same food
   patch as the focal animal at the beginning and at the end of each
   feeding session was recorded. There seems to be no detrimental effect on
   the general condition of males associated with female dominance. The
   male strategy appears to benefit from these social organization
   patterns, which allows them to eat more efficiently than the females
   despite of the fact they were always displaced wherever they ate.
   Females show more variation in numerous feeding parameters than males
   Within L. catta, males and females seemed to have evolved different
   feeding strategies to cope with differences in their energy
   requirements, particularly with regards to reproduction.},

Abstract = {This chapter deals with the adaptation of taste responses of lemurs and
   other primates to different environments, in relation to primary and
   secondary compounds in potential foodstuffs. Emphasis is placed on the
   relationship between taste sensibility to sugars and energy expenditure
   across species. In the most specialized species, the adaptive trends are
   inferred according to the importance of the deviation from such
   allometric relationship. The signification of sugar mimics present in
   some fruits is discussed in terms of coevolution of plants and tasting
   ability of primates, that, for lemurs, parallels that of platyrrhine
   monkeys.
   Taste responses towards other tastants such as sodium chloride are
   examined in relation to potential risks of deficiency and/or toxicity.
   Sensitivity to tannins has been investigated in different species, with
   a two-bottle preference test. We observed large variations that are
   likely to be adaptive to the concentrations in plant species in various
   environments. For instance, the rejection threshold for a mixture of
   tannin and fructose is much higher in Propithecus verreauxi (above 170
   g/l) than in Microcebus murinus (0.54 g/l). Recognition thresholds can
   also vary slightly between human populations, in relation to ancient or
   recent food practices. There is also a wide range of taste sensitivity
   towards quinine, without any correlation, in this case, with body mass
   or other factors related to energy expenditure.
   Different habitats of Madagascar are compared according to the results
   of screening tests on tannins and alkaloids. The eastern rain forest (at
   Andasibe) present slightly lower proportion of plants with alkaloid-like
   reaction, and a significantly higher proportion of tannin-rich plants
   than both the gallery forest and the Didiereaceae bush in the south (at
   Berenty. The results have been related to the gustatory ability of lemur
   species having to cope with these secondary compounds, and the food
   niche of the different species.},

Year = {1999},
Volume = {42},

Abstract = {The last decade's lemur research includes successes in discovering new
   living and extinct species and learning about the distribution,
   biogeography, physiology, behavior, and ecology of previously
   little-studied species. In addition, in both the dry forest and rain
   forest, long-term studies of lemur demography, life history and
   reproduction, have been completed in conjunction with data on tree
   productivity, phenology, and climate. Lemurs contrast with anthropoids
   in several behavioral features, including female dominance, targeted
   female-female aggression, lack of sexual dimorphism regardless of mating
   system, sperm competition coupled with male-male aggression, high infant
   mortality, cathemerality, and strict seasonal breeding. Hypotheses to
   explain these traits include the ``energy conservation hypothesis{''}
   (ECH) suggesting that harsh and unpredictable climate factors on the
   island of Madagascar have affected the evolution of female dominance,
   and the ``evolutionary disequilibrium hypotheses{''} (EVDH) suggesting
   that the recent megafauna extinctions have influenced lemurs to become
   diurnal. These hypotheses are compared and contrasted in light of recent
   empirical data on climate, subfossils, and lemur behavior. New data on
   life histories of the rain forest lemurs at Ranomafana National Park
   give further support to the ECH. Birth seasons are synchronized within
   each species, but there is a 6-month distribution of births among
   species. Gestation and lactation lengths vary among sympatric lemurs,
   but all lemur species in the rain forest wean in synchrony at the season
   most likely to have abundant resources. Across-species weaning synchrony
   seen in Ranomafana corroborates data from the dry forest that late
   lactation and weaning is the life history event that is the primary
   focus of the annual schedule. Lemur adaptations may assure maximum
   offspring survival in this environment with an unpredictable food supply
   and heavy predation. In conclusion, a more comprehensive energy
   frugality hypothesis (EFH) is proposed, which postulates that the
   majority of lemur traits are either adaptations to conserve energy
   (e.g., low basal metabolic rate (BMR), torpor, sperm competition, small
   group size, seasonal breeding) or to maximize use of scarce resources
   (e.g., cathemerality, territoriality, female dominance, fibrous diet,
   weaning synchrony). Among primates, the isolated adaptive radiation of
   lemurs on Madagascar may have been uniquely characterized by selection
   toward efficiency to cope with the harsh and unpredictable island
   environment. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Recent paleontological discoveries in Madagascar document the existence
   of a diverse clade of palaeopropithecids or `'sloth lemurs'':
   Mesopropithecus (three species), Babakotia (one species),
   Palaeopropithecus (three species), and Archaeoindris (one species), This
   mini-radiation of now extinct (''subfossil'') lemurs is most closely
   related to the living indrids (Indri, Propithecus, and Avahi). Whereas
   the extant indrids are known for their leaping acrobatics, the
   palaeopropithecids (except perhaps for the poorly known giant
   Archaeoindris) exhibit numerous skeletal design features for
   antipronograde or suspensory positional behaviors (e.g., high
   intermembral indices and mobile joints). Here we analyze the curvature
   of the proximal phalanges of the hands and feet, Computed as the
   included angle (theta), phalangeal curvature develops in response to
   mechanical use and is known to be correlated in primates with hand and
   foot function in different habitats; terrestrial species have straighter
   phalanges than their arboreal counterparts, and highly suspensory forms
   such as the orangutan possess the most curved phalanges, Sloth lemurs as
   a group are characterized by very curved proximal phalanges, exceeding
   those seen in spider monkeys and siamangs, and approaching: that of
   orangutans. Indrids have curvatures roughly half that of sloth lemurs,
   and the more terrestrial, subfossil Archaeolemur possesses the least
   curved phalanges of all the indroids. Taken together with many other
   derived aspects of their postcranial anatomy, phalangeal curvature
   indicates that the sloth lemurs are one of the most suspensory clades of
   mammals ever to evolve.},

Abstract = {The gregarious lemurs of Madagascar show a lack of convergence with
   anthropoid primates in several social, demographic, morphological and
   ecological features. They lack sexual dimorphism in canine and body
   size, and live in groups with equal adult sex ratios that can vary in
   composition from pairs to larger units. In most species, females
   dominate males, and have brief and often synchronized estruses. Finally,
   lemurs are often active during both day and night (i.e. cathemeral).
   Three hypotheses for this lack of convergence are discussed. The
   traditional explanation is that Madagascar's unique ecological pressures
   have forced females to exclude males from access to limiting resources,
   selecting for the other unique features as means to maintain female
   dominance over males. This idea is not logically consistent and is also
   poorly supported empirically. The second hypothesis claims that
   cathemerality imposes unique constraints on lemur social organization.
   The social behavior of cathemeral taxa is largely consistent with this
   idea. However, the social organization of the diurnal species is not.
   The third hypothesis claims that recent ecological changes, in
   particular the demise of large diurnal raptors, have produced a mismatch
   between current activity periods and adaptations to activity period.
   This idea is supported by a review of morphological adaptations to light
   conditions among lemurs, and, more generally, by a comparative analysis
   of cathemerality among tropical forest mammals. We conclude that the
   social systems of non-nocturnal lemurs are best considered as groups
   formed by species adapted to live in pairs. However, we cannot
   conclusively exclude the possibility that cathemeral activity is an old
   and stable activity pattern among lemurs. We indicate which data would
   decide the issue, and discuss the implications for views of social
   evolution of lemurs and other animals.},

Abstract = {An extensive late Quaternary fauna, including many extinct giant lemurs,
   has been collected recently in a 110+-km system of caves in the Ankarana
   Massif of northern Madagascar. AMS C-14 dates for the acid-insoluble
   (collagen/gelatin) fraction of bones of the giant lemur Megaladapis
   (26,150 +/- 400 and 12,760 +/- 70 yr B.P.) confirm its presence in the
   area during the late Pleistocene and provide the first Pleistocene C-14
   ages from bones of the extinct megafauna of the island. The first date
   from bones of the recently described extinct Babakotia radofilai (4400
   +/- 60 yr B.P.) shows that it was present in northern Madagascar in
   mid-Holocene times. A comparatively recent age of 1020 +/- 50 yr B.P.
   for the extinct Archaeolemur indicates survival of this genus for at
   least a millennium after the first direct evidence for humans in
   Madagascar, This suggests that the island's `'extinction window'' may
   have represented a longer time span than would have been expected under
   the Blitzkrieg model of late Quaternary extinctions. A mid-Holocene age
   (4560 +/- 70 yr B.P.) for a bone sample of the small extant lemur
   Hapalemur simus indicates that the disappearance of this now-restricted
   species from the Ankarana occurred after this date. New data from the
   Ankarana and other sites on the island add to the consensus that major
   biotic changes occurred on Madagascar in the late Holocene. (C) 1995

Abstract = {The flora and fauna of Madagascar evolved rather independently from the
   African mainland. In contrast to other oceanic islands, Madagascar is
   large enough to house most major components of tropical ecosystems,
   allowing tests of evolutionary hypotheses on the level of complete
   communities. Taking lemurs, the primates of Madagascar, as an example,
   evolutionary hypotheses correctly predict the organization of their
   community structure with respect to ecological correlates. Lemur social
   systems and their morphological correlates, on the other hand, deviate
   largely from the typical mammalian      pattern.    Thus,     the   
   traditional hypotheses of behavioral ecology, based solely on resource
   distribution and predation pressure, are insufficient to explain the
   existing variability in lemur social systems. Other factors, such as
   activity patterns and avoidance of infanticide, may be equally
   important. Due to interspecific variation in these   characters,   
   lemurs    offer   the    unique opportunity to determine the relative
   importance of these factors for the evolution of social systems.},

Abstract = {Large body size has evolved repeatedly in the order Primates, not merely
   among anthropoids but also among prosimians. Whereas high degrees of

   paper uses finite mixture analysis and other techniques to ascertain
   just how much skull length dimorphism might be embedded in the generally
   unimodal distributions of skull lengths of giant extinct lemurs from
   single localities, and then compares these results with known skull
   length dimorphisms in extant lemurs and large-bodied catarrhines. We
   show that low levels of skull length sexual dimorphism (or none at all)
   characterize subfossil lemurs, and we explore several possible
   explanations for this phenomenon. Traditional explanations of sexual
   size dimorphism generally focus on body size or mating systems. These
   are not sufficient to explain the variation in sexual dimorphism that

Year = {1993},

Abstract = {The effects of sex and kinship on agonistic and affinitive interactions
   in Lemur catta, Eulemur fulvus, and Eulemur coronatus were examined to
   provide information on the social structure of these primates. All adult
   males and females of three captive forest-living groups served as focal
   animals for one year. In contrast to many anthropoid primates, social
   interactions in these lemurs are characterized by predominantly
   competitive relations among closely related females, with low overall
   rates of polyadic conflicts. In L. catta, same-sexed dyads and pairs of
   closely related individuals had higher proximity-corrected frequencies
   of agonistic interactions than male-female and non-kin dyads. Grooming
   interactions, on the other hand, occurred significantly more often than
   expected in male-female pairs and between unrelated animals. The
   top-ranking male monopolized the majority of male-female interactions.
   In E. fulvus, neither sex nor kinship had significant effects on the
   distribution of grooming and agonistic interactions. Unlike L. catta,
   grooming and conflicts were observed in all dyads, resulting in more
   complex social relationships. Male-female relationships in E. fulvus
   were characterized by strong affiliative relations between individual
   male-female pairs. Social relationships in E. coronatus were generally
   similar to those in E. fulvus, except for a significant sex effect on
   the distribution of interactions, but small sample size precluded a
   final characterization of this rare species.
   Collectively, these results suggest that there may be intense
   competition among individual female lemurs for group membership, even
   among close relatives in the same matriline. Moreover, interspecific
   contrasts in male-male and intersexual relationships indicate
   fundamentally different male roles in these species. This study revealed
   that patterns of agonistic and affinitive interactions are not generally
   predictable from sexual selection theory and interspecific differences
   in life histories, indicating a need for more quantitative descriptions
   of social relationships in diverse taxa to identify other ecological and
   social determinants of social structure.},

Abstract = {Paternity determination by DNA fingerprinting is reported for a
   long-term study group of semi-free-ranging ringtailed lemurs (Lemur
   catta), together with behavioral data collected independently.  In 1985,
   fraternal twin males unfamiliar and unrelated to the resident ringtailed
   lemurs were introduced to the forest enclosure.  Every mature resident
   male attacked the immigrants frequently across the next 5 months,
   whereas no female ever did.  All observed estrous females showed sexual
   proceptivity toward the immigrant males; three solicited copulation
   exclusively from them.  Each female repelled sons, matrilineal brothers,
   and other resident males from attempting to copulate.  Over a 5-year
   period, four of five females always reproduced with distantly related or
   unrelated males (Fig. 3).  Despite low dominance status throughout the
   case study, an immigrant sired the offspring of each females that was
   proceptive toward only the immigrants, demonstrating that female choice
   can override male dominance relations to determine reproductive success
   among male ringtailed lemurs.  In the birth season following the
   1985-1986 immigration, each of four females targeted one or two
   particular adult males for consistent attack across the period of infant
   dependency, beginnig days after parturition.  Paternity determinations,
   colony records, and subsequent study of two groups allowed 66 cases of
   this mode of maternal aggression to be documented.  In each, the
   targeted male had not fathered the protected infant, and almost
   invariably, he was unrelated to the infant's mother.  New mothers
   attacked every male that immigrated following their infant's conceptions
   and a few familiar males with whom they had not been seen to copulate
   during the previous breeding season.  Recent attempts by immigrant males
   to kill infants confirmed the anti-infanticidal function of maternal
   targeting of males.  All results were interpreted together to advance a
   prospective model of the mating system of ringtailed lemurs.  Female
   avoidance of incest has led to the evolution of natal male dispersal. 
   Subsequently, males should prefer to transfer into groups containing few
   and/or status-vulnerable males.  We predict that, by killing others'
   infants, males simultaneously increase chances for success in females'
   next reproductive efforts and terminate current fathers' reproductive
   eligibility in a group.  Basic hypotheses that await testing are that
   (a) raising an infant through weaning reduces a female's chances for
   reproductive success the following year and (b) males that demonstrate
   the capacity to promote the survival of infant offspring are most
   attractive to females as mates.},

Abstract = {Data from wild and semifree-ranging groups of ringtailed lemurs (Lemur
   catta) were combined to evaluate the hypothesis that female ringtailed
   lemurs exhibit asynchrony of estrus within seasonal synchrony of estrous
   cycles.  Photoperiodic and probably social entrainments lead all females
   within social groups of ringtailed lemurs to experience estrus annually
   within periods of 7 to 20 days.  Among an average of five adult females
   in each 11 group-years, however, only 2 separate instances of dyadic
   estrous overlap were observed.  Computer simulations of estrus occurring
   independently among group-living females revealed that this was unlikely
   to have occurred by chance.  Recent research on social enhancement and
   suppression of ovarian cycles in mammals suggests that a single
   pheromone-based signal-response system could mediate both ringtailed
   lemurs' remarkable annual estrous synchrony and the subsidiary
   asynchrony reported here.  Asynchrony of estrus probably functions to
   maximize each female's ability to exercise mate choice by circumventing
   temporal conflict among females.  Asynchrony of estrus and female mate
   choice cause current models to explain male membership in primate groups
   to fail for ringtailed lemurs.  Such results highlight the need for
   detailed information on behavioral and physiological reproductive
   tactics befor generally applicable models or reproductive strategies can
   be developed.},

Title = {Hair phenotype diversity across Indriidae lemurs},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Abstract = {Objectives Hair (i.e., pelage/fur) is a salient feature of primate
   (including human) diversity and evolution-serving functions tied to
   thermoregulation, protection, camouflage, and signaling-but wild primate
   pelage evolution remains relatively understudied. Specifically,
   assessing multiple hypotheses across distinct phylogenetic scales is
   essential but is rarely conducted. We examine whole body hair color and
   density variation across Indriidae (Avahi, Indri, Propithecus)-a lineage
   that, like humans, exhibits vertical posture (i.e., their whole bodies
   are vertical to the sun). Materials and methods Our analyses consider
   multiple phylogenetic scales (family-level, genus-level) and hypotheses
   (e.g., Gloger's rule, the body cooling hypotheses). We obtain hair color
   and density from museum and/or wild animals, opsin genotypes from wild
   animals, and climate data from WorldClim. To analyze our data, we use
   phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models (PGLMM) using Markov chain
   Monte Carlo algorithms. Results Our results show that across the
   Indriidae family, darker hair is typical in wetter regions. However,
   within Propithecus, dark black hair is common in colder forest regions.
   Results also show pelage redness increases in populations exhibiting
   enhanced color vision. Lastly, we find follicle density on the crown and
   limbs increases in dry and open environments. Discussion This study
   highlights how different selective pressures across distinct
   phylogenetic scales have likely acted on primate hair evolution.
   Specifically, our data across Propithecus may implicate thermoregulation
   and is the first empirical evidence of Bogert's rule in mammals. Our
   study also provides rare empirical evidence supporting an early
   hypothesis on hominin hair evolution.},

Title = {A population survey of sympatric cheirogaleids in southwestern
   Madagascar},
Journal = {AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Abstract = {Zombitse-Vohibasia National Park harbours a species-rich but
   understudied lemur community in southwestern Madagascar. Local
   population estimates are dated or absent for its four sympatric species
   of Cheirogaleidae: the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), Coquerel's
   giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli), fat-tailed dwarf lemur
   (Cheirogaleus medius) and pale fork-marked lemur (Phaner pallescens). To
   provide local density and encounter rate estimates for these
   cheirogaleids, we conducted line transect surveys in the Zombitse sector
   of the National Park over a three-week period in December 2018-January
   2019. We calculated densities of 37.4 Mir. coquereli individuals/km(2)
   (95\% CI = 20.4-68.6) and 230.8 C. medius individuals/km(2) (95\% CI =
   172.6-308.6). Our results highlight the conservation importance of
   Zombitse-Vohibasia as a stronghold for these restricted and threatened
   species. The sample sizes for Mic. murinus and P. pallescens were
   insufficient for generating population estimates. Considering that
   Microcebus spp. are typically amongst the most abundant mammals at a
   given site, further studies are needed to investigate and verify this
   apparent scarcity.},

Title = {Impact of model assumptions on demographic inferences: the case study of
   two sympatric mouse lemurs in northwestern Madagascar},
Journal = {BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {Background Quaternary climate fluctuations have been acknowledged as
   major drivers of the geographical distribution of the extraordinary
   biodiversity observed in tropical biomes, including Madagascar. The main
   existing framework for Pleistocene Malagasy diversification assumes that
   forest cover was strongly shaped by warmer Interglacials (leading to
   forest expansion) and by cooler and arid glacials (leading to forest
   contraction), but predictions derived from this scenario for
   forest-dwelling animals have rarely been tested with genomic datasets.
   Results We generated genomic data and applied three complementary
   demographic approaches (Stairway Plot, PSMC and IICR-simulations) to
   infer population size and connectivity changes for two forest-dependent
   primate species (Microcebus murinus and M. ravelobensis) in northwestern
   Madagascar. The analyses suggested major demographic changes in both
   species that could be interpreted in two ways, depending on underlying
   model assumptions (i.e., panmixia or population structure). Under
   panmixia, the two species exhibited larger population sizes across the
   Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and towards the African Humid Period (AHP).
   This peak was followed by a population decline in M. ravelobensis until
   the present, while M. murinus may have experienced a second population
   expansion that was followed by a sharp decline starting 3000 years ago.
   In contrast, simulations under population structure suggested decreasing
   population connectivity between the Last Interglacial and the LGM for
   both species, but increased connectivity during the AHP exclusively for
   M. murinus. Conclusion Our study shows that closely related species may
   differ in their responses to climatic events. Assuming that Pleistocene
   climatic conditions in the lowlands were similar to those in the
   Malagasy highlands, some demographic dynamics would be better explained
   by changes in population connectivity than in population size. However,
   changes in connectivity alone cannot be easily reconciled with a founder
   effect that was shown for M. murinus during its colonization of the
   northwestern Madagascar in the late Pleistocene. To decide between the
   two alternative models, more knowledge about historic forest dynamics in
   lowland habitats is necessary. Altogether, our study stresses that
   demographic inferences strongly depend on the underlying model
   assumptions. Final conclusions should therefore be based on a
   comparative evaluation of multiple approaches.},

Abstract = {The increasing debate and restrictions on primate research have prompted

   available government reports in Europe and the United States. Data on
   taxonomy, country, research area, research class, and type of
   institution were extracted. The 174 qualifying articles showed that
   species in the Galagidae and Cheirogaleidae families were used more
   often in invasive studies of neuroscience and metabolism, while the most
   commonly used species in noninvasive studies of behavior and cognition
   were true lemurs (family Lemuridae). France conducted the greatest
   number of invasive research projects, and the Duke Lemur Center was the
   institution with the most noninvasive studies. This study investigates
   how strepsirrhines are used in captive research and identifies issues in
   need of further review, which suggest that increased participation by

Title = {Hibernation in a primate: does sleep occur?},
Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {During hibernation, critical physiological processes are downregulated
   and thermogenically induced arousals are presumably needed periodically
   to fulfil those physiological demands. Among the processes incompatible
   with a hypometabolic state is sleep. However, one hibernating primate,
   the dwarf lemur Cheirogaleus medius, experiences rapid eye movement
   (REM)-like states during hibernation, whenever passively reaching
   temperatures above 30 degrees C, as occurs when it hibernates in poorly
   insulated tree hollows under tropical conditions. Here, we report
   electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, temperature data and metabolic
   rates from two related species (C. crossleyi and C. sibreei), inhabiting
   high-altitude rainforests and hibernating underground, conditions that
   mirror, to some extent, those experienced by temperate hibernators. We
   compared the physiology of hibernation and spontaneous arousals in these
   animals to C. medius, as well as the much more distantly related
   non-primate hibernators, such as Arctic, golden-mantled and European
   ground squirrels. We observed a number of commonalities with non-primate
   temperate hibernators including: (i) monotonous ultra-low voltage EEG
   during torpor bouts in these relatively cold-weather hibernators, (ii)
   the absence of sleep during torpor bouts, (iii) the occurrence of
   spontaneous arousals out of torpor, during which sleep regularly
   occurred, (iv) relatively high early EEG non-REM during the arousal, and
   (v) a gradual transition to the torpid EEG state from non-REM sleep.
   Unlike C. medius, our study species did not display sleep-like states
   during torpor bouts, but instead exclusively exhibited them during
   arousals. During these short euthermic periods, non-REM as well as REM
   sleep-like stages were observed. Differences observed between these two
   species and their close relative, C. medius, for which data have been
   published, presumably reflect differences in hibernaculum temperature.},

Title = {The role of acoustic signaling for spacing and group coordination in a

Abstract = {ObjectivesHow social groups govern their distribution in time and space
   is a central question in socioecology. The aim of this study is to
   explore the role of acoustic signaling for spacing and cohesiveness in a
   nocturnal, cohesive, pair-living strepsirrhine.
   Material and MethodsThe study was conducted in northwestern Madagascar.
   Six pairs of Avahi occidentalis were radio-collared and home range
   usage, vocalizations and call-associated behavior recorded using
   GPS-based focal animal sampling. Home range size was analyzed using
   ArcView GIS 3.3. Calls were characterized by a multiparametric sound
   analysis.
   ResultsThree frequently used, acoustically distinct call types were
   identified: the avahee call, the whistle call, and the growling call,
   the latter is a soft; the two others are loud calls. Call types are
   given by both sexes and convey individually-specific signatures. Call
   types are used primarily in the locomotion context in the non-core-area
   of home ranges. The least common avahee call is responded by the avahee
   call from farther away. The more common whistle call, given when
   partners become visually isolated, and the growling call emitted at
   close distances, were answered by the whistle and the growling call.
   Results suggest a spacing function for the avahee call and group
   coordination functions for the other call types.
   DiscussionOur study provides first empirical evidence for a nocturnal,
   cohesive pair-living strepsirrhine that vocal signaling represents an
   important mechanism for spacing, group coordination and decision making.
   Findings contribute to a better understanding of the evolutionary roots
   of primate vocal communication. Am J Phys Anthropol 159:466-477, 2016.

Title = {Dietary Flexibility and Feeding Strategies of Eulemur: A Comparison with

Abstract = {Despite the great variety of habitats in Madagascar, Eulemur has
   successfully populated most forested habitats on the island. Although
   the high dietary flexibility of Eulemur is often credited as one of the
   drivers of its evolutionary success, other behavioral evidence suggests
   a limited capacity for dietary switching. To shed light on the feeding
   strategies of Eulemur, we compared the dietary flexibility between
   populations of this genus with that of another widespread lemur taxon,
   Propithecus. We hypothesized that Eulemur would show greater dietary
   flexibility than Propithecus, which has a digestive system specialized
   for folivory, and that Eulemur living in dry forests would switch its
   diet from fruit to other food seasonally. To examine these hypotheses,
   we performed a phylogenetic least-squares analysis on 10 populations of
   Eulemur and 7 of Propithecus to assess the contribution of environmental
   variables and body mass on their dietary flexibility while controlling
   for phylogenetic relatedness. Eulemur relied heavily on fruit and did
   not show large variations in primary food over the year. Propithecus
   consumed leaves and fruits equally and exhibited considerable
   flexibility across seasons. Therefore, in contrast to our predictions,
   the anatomical specialization for fiber digestion heightens dietary
   flexibility in Propithecus. At the intrageneric level, we found similar
   ecogeographic variation; populations of both genera with heavier body
   mass consumed more fruit. As we predicted, Eulemur in drier habitats
   switched the diet from fruit to alternative food more frequently. To
   compensate for low dietary flexibility, Eulemur mostly adopts a
   power-feeding strategy by which it increases energy expenditure to
   acquire patchily distributed fruit resources.},

   Methods and Results We analyzed laboratory records of the Gorgas
   Memorial Institute (GMI) Aotus monkey colony in Panama for the period
   1999-2010 and found a 273\% increase in the annual mean life births in
   the following 7 years after the introduction of a PVC pipe nest-box in
   2002, as well as increases in the mean body mass and survival of
   laboratory-bred monkeys. Other life traits such as inter-birth interval,
   parity, birth sex distribution, mortality, and longevity were also
   determined.
   Conclusions The use of a PVC pipe nest-box significantly improved the
   reproductive efficiency and other life traits of the GMI Aotus breeding

Title = {Semi-Quantitative Tests of Cyanide in Foods and Excreta of Three
   Hapalemur Species in Madagascar},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {72},
Number = {1},
Pages = {56-61},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Three sympatric Hapalemur species (H. g. griseus, H. aureus, and H.
   (Prolemur) simus) in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar are known to
   eat bamboo food parts that contain cyanide. How these lemurs avoid
   cyanide poisoning remains unknown. In this study, we tested for the
   presence/absence of cyanide in bamboo lemur foods and excreta to (1)
   document patterns of cyanide consumption among species with respect to
   diet, (2) identify routes of elimination of cyanide from the
   gastrointestinal tract, and (3) determine whether cyanide is absorbed
   from the diet. We tested 102 food, urine, and fecal samples for hydrogen
   cyanide (HCN) during two ``pre-dry{''} seasons (April 2006, May 2007)
   using commercially available Cyantesmo test strips. The test strips
   changed color in the presence of HCN and we recorded color change on a
   scale of 0 (no change) to 5 (cobalt) at preset intervals with a final
   score taken at 24 hr. We detected cyanide in bamboo food parts and urine
   of all three Hapalemur species. Time to color change of the test strips
   ranged from almost instantaneous to > 12 hr incubation. Of the foods
   tested, only bamboo contained cyanide, but results differed among bamboo
   species and plant parts of the same species. Specifically, branch shoot
   and culm pith of the giant bamboo produced strong, immediate reactions
   to the test paper, whereas parts of liana bamboos produced either weak
   or no color change. Cyanide was present in almost all urine samples but
   rarely in fecal samples. This suggests that dietary cyanide is absorbed
   in the gastrointestinal tract of the Hapalemur species and excreted, at
   least in part, by the kidneys. Samples from H. griseus exhibited lower,
   though still detectable, cyanide levels compared with H. simus and H.
   aureus. Differences among lemur species appear to be related to the
   specific bamboo parts consumed. Am. J. Primatol. 72:56-61, 2010. (C)

Abstract = {Olfactory signals can communicate a wide variety of information and are
   very important in many mammalian species. However, little is known about
   the olfactory communication of primates. This study used gas
   chromatography to examine the volatile components of the anogenital
   gland secretions of wild Milne-Edward's sifaka, Propithecus edwardsi
   (Primates, Indriidae) (n = 17), captured in Ranomafana National Park,
   Madagascar. We compared scent swabs of animals and examined differences
   between social group, age class, sex, and season. The only identified
   differences in the volatiles were between swabs from the different
   seasons; all other categories were statistically indistinguishable.},

Title = {Activity budgets and activity rhythms in red ruffed lemurs (Varecia
   rubra) on the Masoala Peninsula, Madagascar: Seasonality and
   reproductive energetics},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-44},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The activity budgets and daily activity rhythms of Varecia rubra were
   examined over an annual cycle according to season and reproductive
   stage. Given the relatively high reproductive costs and patchy food
   resources of this species, I predicted that V rubra would 1) travel less
   and feed more during seasonal resource scarcity in an attempt to
   maintain energy balance, and 2) show sex differences in activity budgets
   due to differing reproductive investment. Contrary to the first
   prediction, V rubra does not increase feeding time during seasonal food
   scarcity; rather, females feed for a consistent amount of time in every
   season, whereas males feed most during the resource-rich, hot dry
   season. The results are consistent with other predictions: V. rubra
   travels less in the resource-scarce cold rainy season, and there are
   some pronounced sex differences, with females feeding more and resting
   less than males in every season and in every reproductive stage except
   gestation. However, there are also some provocative similarities between
   the sexes when activity budgets are examined by reproductive stage.
   During gestation, female and male activity budgets do not differ and
   appear geared toward energy accumulation: both sexes feed and rest
   extensively and travel least during this stage. During lactation,
   activity budgets are geared toward high energy expenditure: both sexes
   travel most and in equal measure, and rest least, although it remains
   the case that females feed more and rest less than males. These
   similarities between female and male activity budgets appear related to
   cooperative infant care. The high energetic costs of reproduction in V.
   rubra females may require that they allot more time to feeding year
   round, and that their overall activity budget be more directly
   responsive to seasonal climate change, seasonal food distribution, and
   reproductive schedules. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Sixteen dinucleotide microsatellite loci were isolated from the genome
   of Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi. All loci were polymorphic when
   genotyped on a minimum of 16 animals. The number of alleles across these
   loci ranges from two to 11. Additionally, seven of these loci were
   genotyped across a minimum of 200 animals in order to estimate
   heterozygosity and their potential for parentage assignment in this
   population. Using these seven loci, the mean heterozygosity in this
   population is 0.705, and the combined probability of these seven loci to
   exclude a random individual from parentage, when one parent is known, is
   0.996. These data suggest that these loci will be useful for estimating
   a variety of population genetic and genealogical parameters in R v.
   verreauxi populations. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss,Inc.},

   painting confirm those obtained by R-banding except for some reciprocal
   translocations undetected by R-banding. Our findings confirm that in the
   evolution of the Indridae, Avahi laniger first emerges, then Indri and
   Propithecus share a common trunk. After populational evolution, this

Abstract = {The feeding behaviour and diet of the black-and-white ruffed femur
   (Varecia variegata variegata) was investigated in the Betampona Reserve,
   eastern Madagascar. The highly frugivorous diet of this subspecies was
   confirmed - feeding on fruits accounting for 92.0\% of feeding records.
   Most feeding at Betampona was observed at 10-25 m above the forest floor
   amongst flexible, small (0.5-5.0 cm diameter) and oblique/horizontal
   (0-45 degrees) supports. The Varecia spent on average 21.7\% (+/- 1.5)
   of their daily activity budget feeding and employ a variety of postures
   that enable them to harvest fruits in the rain forest canopy. The
   suspensory postures were the most important in allowing Varecia to
   compete with other smaller-bodied frugivores. Copyright (C) 2000 S.

   presence of another species in the region. One of the main interests of
   this new site is that the entire macrofauna is constituted of the
   remains of Archaeolemur and that the site has not been disturbed. Some
   specimens are in anatomical connection. (C) Academie des

Abstract = {In some aged Microcebus brains (8- to 11-year-old animals) dramatic
   atrophy is found, particularly of the cortex, the hippocampus, the basal
   ganglia, the brainstem and the cerebellum, associated with a conspicuous
   increase in the size of the cerebral ventricles. These morphological
   changes are accompanied by certain histological profiles indicative of
   pathology. In the cortex, these histological changes consist of 1) a
   large number of senile plaques composed of degenerated neurites
   sometimes surrounding an amyloid plaque, 2) amyloid deposits in the
   vascular walls and 3) dense bundles of argyrophilic filaments in
   numerous pyramidal neurons. All these lesions resemble changes
   associated with Alzheimer's disease in man. The degenerative changes
   observed in the Microcebus brain are accompanied by behavioral changes.
   At the moment these preliminary studies, carried out on the smallest of
   all primates, do not prove that the degeneration is of the Alzheimer
   type, but do indicate that Microcebus murinus may well be a good model
   for the study of cerebral aging, providing a comparison with cerebral
   ageing in humans. The size, life span and cost of the animal provide
   further advantages when compared with other nonhuman primates.},

Title = {Molecular Liver Fingerprint Reflects the Seasonal Physiology of the Grey
   Mouse Lemur (Microcebus murinus) during Winter},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) are primates that respond to
   environmental energetic constraints through strong physiological
   seasonality. They notably fatten during early winter (EW), and mobilize
   their lipid reserves while developing glucose intolerance during late
   winter (LW), when food availability is low. To decipher how the hepatic
   mechanisms may support such metabolic flexibility, we analyzed the liver
   proteome of adult captive male mouse lemurs, whose seasonal regulations
   are comparable to their wild counterparts. We highlight profound hepatic
   changes that reflect fat accretion in EW at the whole-body level,
   without triggering an ectopic storage of fat in the liver, however.
   Moreover, molecular regulations are consistent with the decrease in
   liver glucose utilization in LW, and therefore with reduced tolerance to
   glucose. However, no major regulation was seen in insulin
   signaling/resistance pathways. Fat mobilization in LW appeared possibly
   linked to the reactivation of the reproductive system while enhanced
   liver detoxification may reflect an anticipation to return to summer
   levels of food intake. Overall, these results show that the physiology
   of mouse lemurs during winter relies on solid molecular foundations in
   liver processes to adapt fuel partitioning while opposing the
   development of a pathological state despite large lipid fluxes.},

   Understanding how wildlife respond to human activities at the population
   and individual level will help inform management of landscapes where
   humans and wildlife can coexist. We examined the effects of
   anthropogenic activities on a critically endangered primate, Verreaux's
   sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), at a multiple-use reserve in southwest
   Madagascar. Specifically, we sought to determine which activities the
   sifakas perceived as disturbances, using the framework of the risk
   disturbance hypothesis (RDH). The RDH holds that animals will respond to
   perceived disturbances as they do to predation threats. We therefore
   predicted that sifakas would be more vigilant, spend more time in high
   forest strata, reduce their daily feeding time, and occur at lower
   densities in response to high levels of perceived disturbance. Using
   data on sifaka behavior and spatial distribution, and the frequencies of
   anthropogenic activities, we found that sifakas increased vigilance and
   their height above the ground in response to certain human-related
   activities, notably those of domestic dogs. Contrary to our predictions,
   however, we did not find a negative effect of anthropogenic activities
   on daily activity budgets or population density. The relationship
   between the occurrence of sifakas and the intensity of tree cutting was
   actually positive. Our results indicate that sifakas perceive certain
   anthropogenic activities as threats and respond with immediate
   behavioral shifts, but that these activities do not have a discernible
   negative impact on the reserve's population at this time. These results
   suggest that lemur conservation can be successful even in areas that are
   subject to moderate human use.},

Title = {Restriction Site-Associated DNA Sequencing Reveals Local Adaptation
   Despite High Levels of Gene Flow in Sardinella lemuru (Bleeker, 1853)
   Along the Northern Coast of Mindanao, Philippines},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {09},
Month = {FEB 24},
Abstract = {Stock identification and delineation are important in the management and
   conservation of marine resources. These were highlighted as priority
   research areas for Bali sardinella (Sardinella lemuru) which is among
   the most commercially important fishery resources in the Philippines.
   Previous studies have already assessed the stocks of S. lemuru between
   Northern Mindanao Region (NMR) and Northern Zamboanga Peninsula (NZP),
   yielding conflicting results. Phenotypic variation suggests distinct
   stocks between the two regions, while mitochondrial DNA did not detect
   evidence of genetic differentiation for this high gene flow species.
   This paper tested the hypothesis of regional structuring using
   genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) acquired through
   restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq). We examined
   patterns of population genomic structure using a full panel of 3,573
   loci, which was then partitioned into a neutral panel of 3,348 loci and
   an outlier panel of 31 loci. Similar inferences were obtained from the
   full and neutral panels, which were contrary to the inferences from the
   outlier panel. While the full and neutral panels suggested a panmictic
   population (global F-ST similar to 0, p > 0.05), the outlier panel
   revealed genetic differentiation between the two regions (global F-ST =
   0.161, p = 0.001; F-CT = 0.263, p < 0.05). This indicated that while
   gene flow is apparent, selective forces due to environmental
   heterogeneity between the two regions play a role in maintaining
   adaptive variation. Annotation of the outlier loci returned five genes
   that were mostly involved in organismal development. Meanwhile, three
   unannotated loci had allele frequencies that correlated with sea surface
   temperature. Overall, our results provided support for local adaptation
   despite high levels of gene flow in S. lemuru. Management therefore
   should not only focus on demographic parameters (e.g., stock size and
   catch volume), but also consider the preservation of adaptive variation.},

Title = {Forest Fragments, Lemur Communities and Local Perception of Nature in a
   Protected Area of Northwestern Madagascar},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {FEB 24},
Abstract = {Biological conservation projects conducted in inhabited areas are often
   based on the combination of ecological diagnostics and study of
   practices and use of the environment by local communities. They less
   frequently integrate the influence of the perception and representation
   of nature on these practices, while these should also be taken into
   account in the initiation of sustainable conservation actions. We
   carried out a long-term study combining biological and social science
   approaches in North-western Madagascar in the Antrema protected area
   (with dry forest/savannah/coastal ecosystems), including an analysis of
   the use and perception of nature by its inhabitants. Together with the
   study of tree diversity, forest structure and biomass in 7 forest
   fragments, we estimated population densities of whole communities of
   diurnal and nocturnal lemurs, one of which is considered sacred. We
   interviewed local resource users from several villages using classical
   methods of social anthropology supplemented with perception tests
   derived from sensory evaluation methods. The structure of forest
   fragments as well as their basal area and richness in tree species
   varied with human pressure on specific plants (timber extraction) or
   with historical changes in pasture management (forest regrowth). Lemurs
   were generally abundant, with a high total biomass compared to other dry
   forests. Although the inhabitants of Antrema (Sakalava, Tsimihety, and
   Betsileo) still strongly adhered to local use rights and shared deeply
   rooted knowledge about the forest, the use and perception of nature
   (e.g., regarding the sacred lemur Propithecus coronatus) have changed
   since the Antrema protection project in 2000. The results suggest that
   local communities tend to integrate traditional rules about nature with
   international environmental regulation, perhaps a sign of a new
   ecological awareness. However, in the new management mode accompanying
   this transition, it can also be a means of local empowerment that takes
   advantage of a program supporting pro-environmental management of the
   Antrema area.},

Title = {Evidence for acoustic discrimination in lemurs: a playback study on wild
   indris (Indri indri)},
Journal = {CURRENT ZOOLOGY},
Abstract = {Indris Indri indri are group-living lemurs that occupy stable
   territories over several years and perform remarkable long-distance
   vocal displays. Vocal exchanges between long-term territory neighbors
   may contribute to assessing reciprocal resource-holding potentials, thus
   adaptively reducing the costs of territorial defense by limiting
   aggressive escalation. Previous work showed that indris' songs show
   distinctive acoustic features at individual and group level. However,
   the possibility that indris use such cues for individual or group-level
   recognition has never been investigated experimentally. We conducted a
   playback experiment to test whether indris discriminate between familiar
   and nonfamiliar songs. Our rationale lies in the hypothesis of the dear
   enemy phenomenon, which predicts that territorial animals will show
   reduced aggression levels toward familiar neighbors compared with novel
   rivals. We played back stimulus recordings to wild indris from their
   territory boundaries and examined their responses in terms of vocal and
   behavioral indicators of willingness to engage in a fight. In line with
   our predictions, focal animals responded more rapidly and approached
   more often the speaker in response to playback stimuli of nonfamiliar
   individuals than to stimuli of neighboring groups. These results
   indicate that indris can discriminate between different classes of
   intruders based on distinctive acoustic features of their song choruses.
   We suggest that increased aggression directed toward unfamiliar
   intruders may be explained by higher threat levels associated with
   dispersal and group formation dynamics. We further discuss the relevance
   of these findings in a strepsirrhine primate model for comparative
   studies of vocal communication and sociality.},

Title = {Using a Phylogenetic Framework to Assess the Role of Fruit Size in Food

Volume = {43},

Abstract = {The study of diet and food selection is foundational to understanding
   how primates interact with their environment. Due to the potential
   evolutionary relationship between fruit physical traits and frugivory in
   animals, our goal was to understand the composition and the evolutionary
   relationships of plant species in the Andean night monkey's diet (Aotus
   lemurinus) in Pijao-Quindio, Colombia. We hypothesize that
   phylogenetically related plants share fruit physical traits, such as
   size, which make them more likely to be selected. We estimated the diet
   of two groups of monkeys through feeding time (4,431 min) and surveyed
   fruit-bearing trees available (from 40 spp.) through five phenological
   transects from July 2018 to July 2019. To evaluate whether feeding time
   is influenced by fruit size, controlling for phylogeny, we mapped the
   fruit size of each species onto the phylogeny and tested for the
   phylogenetic signal using comparative phylogenetic methods. We found
   that the Andean night monkey selected some fruit species (of 29 spp.
   selected) disproportionately more often relative to their abundance and
   spent more time feeding on fruit-bearing trees belonging to the Rosidae
   subclass than other subclasses (pattern also found in other populations
   in Colombia). Although fruit size had a strong phylogenetic signal, it
   was not significantly related to time spent feeding on fruits, even
   after controlling for the phylogenetic relationships among fruit
   species. Our results suggest that fruit size does not influence fruit
   selection and that we need to assess other fruit traits (physical and
   phytochemical) to better understand the coevolutionary dynamics in this
   tropical forest.},

Title = {Comparison of gastrointestinal microbiota in golden snub-nosed monkey

Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},

Abstract = {High throughput sequencing of gut microbiota helps to understand the
   nutrition and health of the host. In this sense, it is an important tool
   for improving wildlife conservation and management. Little is known
   about the microbial communities occupying the gastrointestinal tract and
   the differences of microbiota among primate species. We conducted a
   microbiome study of the gastrointestinal tract in golden snub-nosed
   monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellanae), green monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops
   sabaeus), and ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), using the 16S rRNA gene
   amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The
   gastrointestinal tract of all three primates were characterized by
   Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, although the relative
   abundance of these taxa differed across non-human primate species and
   gastrointestinal segments. In addition, the stomach of the golden monkey
   demonstrated a strong signal of microbial metabolic activity, especially
   in metabolizing carbohydrate. Prevotella multisaccharivorax and
   Selenomonas bovis were the main contributors to the function, and the
   enzymes involved in these metabolic activities were mainly derived from
   the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family. Microbial composition and function
   vary widely across non-human primate species and gastrointestinal
   segments. Therefore, while faecal samples are necessary for studying
   many mammals, particularly in the wild, data from the gastrointestinal
   tract have the potential to greatly improve our knowledge of host-gut
   microbe interactions. This information can contribute to the development
   of conservation interventions and animal care protocols in the wild and
   captivity to more fully describe a species' nutritional needs and
   advance health and survival.},

Title = {A 24-Year Record of Female Reproductive Dynamics in Two Sympatric Mouse
   Lemur Species in Northwestern Madagascar},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Abstract = {Seasonal reproduction is widespread among primates but the degree of
   reproductive synchrony and plasticity can vary, even between closely
   related species. This study compares the dynamics of female reproductive
   seasonality in two mouse lemur species, Microcebus murinus and M.
   ravelobensis, in Ankarafantsika National Park, Madagascar, across 24
   years. We collected 4321 records of female reproductive state from 1033
   individual females (319 M. murinus, 714 M. ravelobensis). The analyses
   revealed disparate reproductive schedules: While female M. murinus
   showed high degrees of reproductive synchrony throughout all years,
   leading to the production of two successive litters, the seasonal onset
   of estrus (= reproductive activation) in female M. ravelobensis was more
   flexible than in M. murinus, starting 2-4 weeks earlier, varying by up
   to 4 weeks between years, and being less synchronized. M. ravelobensis
   females became reproductively active later in years with more rainfall,
   in particular rain in February, but the timing of reproductive
   activation was not related to differences in temperatures. The
   likelihood of early conception was significantly lower in M.
   ravelobensis than in M. murinus. This was partly due to delayed
   reproductive activation in young animals, and a lower likelihood of
   early conception for females with low body mass in M. ravelobensis. Our
   results suggest high, adaptive reproductive plasticity in M.
   ravelobensis that may enable individuals to respond flexibly to yearly
   environmental changes and expand the reproductive period under favorable
   conditions. These species differences in reproductive schedules may be
   the result of the divergent evolutionary histories of the two mouse
   lemur species in different parts of Madagascar.},

Abstract = {Captive nonhuman primates frequently experience bite wounds inflicted by
   conspecifics; however, few studies evaluate wound management in these
   animals. This study evaluates bite wound management in 35 captive
   ring-tailed lemurs (RTL, Lemur catta) held within five British
   zoological institutions between 2015 and 2019. Treatments for 152 bite
   incidents resulting in 211 bite wounds were summarized. Treatment
   efficacy and potential risk factors for bite wound complications were
   evaluated for correlations with outcomes. Treatments in the first 48
   hours included analgesia alone (54/152; 35.5\%); analgesia and
   antimicrobials (42/152; 27.6\%); no treatment (26/152; 17.1\%);
   analgesia, antimicrobials, and wound management under anesthesia
   (24/152; 15.8\%); and antimicrobials alone (6/152; 3.9\%). Poor outcomes
   were observed in RTL in association with 20.4\% of wounds (43/211):
   signs of pain (SOP) after 48 hours were the most common (30/211;
   14.2\%), followed by signs of infection (SOI, 16/211; 7.6\%), wound
   dehiscence (7/211; 3.3\%), and abnormal function or behavior at day 30
   (4/211; 1.9\%). Poor outcomes were more likely with severe bite wounds
   and bite wounds to the hand or limb (thoracic or pelvic, excluding the
   hand or foot). Specifically, SOP were more likely to be observed with
   severe wounds and solitary wounds, and SOI were more likely to be
   observed with wounds not treated with early antimicrobials. When SOI
   occurred, most resolved with antimicrobial treatment alone. Early
   analgesia is recommended for RTL with bite wounds. If SOP persist,
   multimodal analgesia should be administered. Clinicians should consider
   withholding antimicrobials for RTL with bite wounds of mild and moderate
   severity until SOI are observed.},

Abstract = {The Anthropocene is a major threat to biodiversity worldwide. Human
   pressures including climate change and emerging infectious diseases are
   presenting new challenges to wildlife, requiring vigilance and
   monitoring of wild populations to ensure their persistence. In order to
   monitor fluctuations in health, baseline data from long-term studies are
   required. Clinical laboratory data on 80 black-and-white ruffed lemurs
   (Varecia variegata), derived from the capture of 98 individuals spanning
   six field seasons are presented. Serum biochemical profiles showed
   variation between years that remained within published reference
   intervals for the species, with the exception of total bilirubin in
   2008, and creatine kinase and chloride in 2019. Serum trace minerals and
   fat-soluble vitamin values also fluctuated between years and are within
   ranges seen in other lemur species. These results, combined with
   previously published data on ectoparasite load and population genetic
   diversity, suggest that the Mangevo ruffed lemur population is healthy
   and can provide important and valuable baseline data for comparisons
   moving forward.},

Volume = {288},

Abstract = {Cognitive abilities covary with both social and ecological factors
   across animal taxa. Ecological generalists have been attributed with
   enhanced cognitive abilities, but which specific ecological factors may
   have shaped the evolution of which specific cognitive abilities remains
   poorly known. To explore these links, we applied a cognitive test
   battery (two personality, ten cognitive tests; n = 1104 tests) to wild
   individuals of two sympatric mouse lemur species (n = 120 Microcebus
   murinus, n = 34 M. berthae) varying in ecological adaptations but
   sharing key features of their social systems. The habitat and dietary
   generalist grey mouse lemurs were more innovative and exhibited better
   spatial learning abilities; a cognitive advantage in responding
   adaptively to dynamic environmental conditions. The more specialized
   Madame Berthe's mouse lemurs were faster in learning associative reward
   contingencies, providing relative advantages in stable environmental
   conditions. Hence, our study revealed key cognitive correlates of
   ecological adaptations and indicates potential cognitive constraints of
   specialists that may help explain why they face a greater extinction
   risk in the context of current environmental changes.},

Title = {Enriched sleep environments lengthen lemur sleep duration},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Characteristics of the sleep-site are thought to influence the quality
   and duration of primate sleep, yet only a handful of studies have
   investigated these links experimentally. Using actigraphy and infrared
   videography, we quantified sleep in four lemur species (Eulemur
   coronatus, Lemur catta, Propithecus coquereli, and Varecia rubra) under
   two different experimental conditions at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in
   Durham, NC, USA. Individuals from each species underwent three weeks of
   simultaneous testing to investigate the hypothesis that comfort level of
   the sleep-site influences sleep. We obtained baseline data on normal
   sleep, and then, in a pair-wise study design, we compared the daily
   sleep times, inter-daily activity stability, and intra-daily activity
   variability of individuals in simultaneous experiments of sleep-site
   enrichment and sleep-site impoverishment. Over 164 24-hour periods from
   8 individuals (2 of each species), we found evidence that enriched
   sleep-sites increased daily sleep times of lemurs, with an average
   increase of thirty-two minutes. The effect of sleep-site impoverishment
   was small and not statistically significant. Though our experimental
   manipulations altered inter-daily stability and intra-daily variability
   in activity patterns relative to baseline, the changes did not differ
   significantly between enriched and impoverished conditions. We conclude
   that properties of a sleep-site enhancing softness or insulation, more
   than the factors of surface area or stability, influence lemur sleep,
   with implications regarding the importance of nest building in primate
   evolution and the welfare and management of captive lemurs.},

Title = {Factors affecting call usage in wild black-and-white ruffed lemurs

Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},

Abstract = {Vocal communication is an important modality for group-living primates
   inhabiting dense forest habitats that can hinder visual and olfactory
   signals. Nevertheless, research on primate vocalizations has
   historically focused on a narrow subset of haplorhine taxa;
   comparatively few studies have been focused on strepsirrhines, despite
   facing similar ecological and social challenges. Ruffed lemurs
   (Varecia)-a taxon known for their raucous calls-are rainforest
   specialists that exhibit strong fission-fusion dynamics and communally
   rear large litters of young. However, surprisingly few studies have
   examined Varecia vocalizations in the wild, meaning virtually nothing is
   known about the call types or how they facilitate their unique social
   and reproductive strategies. Our goal for this study was to examine how
   various contextual factors such as weather, behavioral state, and
   subgroup size and composition affected vocal activity across call types
   in wild black-and-white ruffed lemurs. We conducted focal follows on 31
   individuals (two communities) in Mangevo (Ranomafana National Park) from
   May-August 2019 to record behavioral and vocal activity. We
   distinguished 11 call types, although three (hum, roar-shriek, chatter)
   constituted the majority of vocal activity. Calling rates were
   consistent throughout the day, but decreased with high rainfall. We
   found sex- and subgroup-specific differences in call usage, likely
   related to female dominance and subgroup composition, respectively. We
   identified behavioral contexts that some call types were consistently
   given in; this can be used to help infer call function. This study
   provides some of the first quantitative analyses of ruffed lemur vocal
   communication and lays the groundwork for more systematic hypothesis
   testing in future studies.},

Journal = {OPEN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {In the last decade, LMTK3 (lemur tyrosine kinase 3) has emerged as an
   important player in breast cancer, contributing to the advancement of
   disease and the acquisition of resistance to therapy through a
   strikingly complex set of mechanisms. Although the knowledge of its
   physiological function is largely limited to receptor trafficking in
   neurons, there is mounting evidence that LMTK3 promotes oncogenesis in a
   wide variety of cancers. Recent studies have broadened our understanding
   of LMTK3 and demonstrated its importance in numerous signalling
   pathways, culminating in the identification of a potent and selective
   LMTK3 inhibitor. Here, we review the roles of LMTK3 in health and
   disease and discuss how this research may be used to develop novel
   therapeutics to advance cancer treatment.},

Abstract = {Lemur tail kinase 1 (LMTK1), previously called apoptosis-associated
   tyrosine kinase (AATYK), is an endosomal Ser/Thr kinase. We recently
   reported that LMTK1 regulates axon outgrowth, dendrite arborization and
   spine formation via Rab11-mediated vesicle transport. Rab11, a small
   GTPase regulating recycling endosome trafficking, is shown to be
   associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). In fact,
   genome-wide association studies identified many proteins regulating
   vesicle transport as risk factors for LOAD. Furthermore, LMTK1 has been
   reported to be a risk factor for frontotemporal dementia. Then, we
   hypothesized that LMTK1 contributes to AD development through vesicle
   transport and examined the effect of LMTK1 on the cellular localization
   of AD-related proteins, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and ss-site APP
   cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). The ss-cleavage of APP by BACE1 is the
   initial and rate-limiting step in A ss generation. We found that LMTK1
   accumulated BACE1, but not APP, to the perinuclear endosomal
   compartment, whereas the kinase-negative(kn) mutant of LMTK1A did not.
   The ss-C-terminal fragment was prone to increase under overexpression of
   LMTK1A kn. Moreover, the expression level of LMTK1Awas reduced
   inADbrains. These results suggest the possibility that LMTK1 is involved
   in AD development through the regulation of the proper endosomal
   localization of BACE1.},

Title = {Sportive lemurs elevate theirmetabolic rate during challenging seasons
   and do not enter regular heterothermy},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 11},
Abstract = {Animals experience seasonal changes of environmental and ecological
   conditions in most habitats. Fluctuations in ambient temperature have a
   strong influence on thermoregulation, particularly on small endothermic
   mammals. However, different mammalian species cope differently with
   these changes. Understanding the physiological responses of organisms to
   different seasons and analysing the mechanisms that account for intra-
   and inter-specific differences and the ecological consequences of these
   variations is important to predict species responses to climatic
   changes. Consequences of climatic changes will be most pronounced in
   climatically already challenging habitats, such as the dry regions of
   western Madagascar. We aimed to identify the seasonal responses and
   adaptive possibilities in energy budgeting of Lepilemur edwardsi, a
   small primate of this habitat, by measuring metabolic rate (MR;
   open-flow respiratory) and skin temperature in the field during
   different seasons. Resting metabolism was generally low, but our study
   did not detect any signs of regular heterothermic episodes, despite the
   fact that these are known in other sympatrically living lemurs with a
   similar lifestyle. Surprisingly, L. edwardsi responded by elevating its
   resting MR in the poor-resourced dry season, compared to the
   better-resourced wet season, presumably to master detoxification of
   their increasingly toxic diet. As body mass decreased over this time,
   this strategy is obviously not energetically balanced on the long term.
   This is cause for concern, as it suggests that L. edwardsi has a very
   small leeway to adjust to changing conditions as experienced due to
   climate change, as dry season are expected to become longer and hotter,
   straining water budgets and food quality even more. Moreover, our
   findings highlight the importance of studying physiological parameters
   directly in the field and under differing climatic conditions.},

Abstract = {Ten red ruffed lemurs (Varecia rubra)-two adult females and their eight
   offspring-were evaluated in this case series. Two adult females were
   diagnosed with chronic, latent toxoplasmosis based on serologic testing.
   The first female lemur had two successive pregnancies. The first
   pregnancy resulted in transplacental transmission of Toxoplasma gondii.
   The only surviving offspring was diagnosed with congenital toxoplasmosis
   based on serologic testing and compatible ophthalmic lesions. The two
   deceased offspring had disseminated nonsuppurative inflammation and
   intralesional protozoal organisms consistent with T. gondii, which was
   confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. The second pregnancy did not
   result in transplacental transmission. The second chronically infected
   adult female lemur had one pregnancy that resulted in a single stillborn
   fetus without evidence of transplacental transmission of T. gondii.
   Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and folinic acid was
   administered to the first adult female and one offspring, but no
   treatment was given to the second adult female. All surviving lemurs had
   no further complications associated with toxoplasmosis. This case series
   demonstrates that chronic, latent infection of reproductive female red
   ruffed lemurs with T. gondii may result in variable outcomes: (1)
   transplacental transmission with disseminated fetal infection and
   stillbirth, (2) transplacental transmission with congenital infection
   and survival, or (3) lack of transplacental transmission and healthy
   offspring. Information gained from these cases may help guide
   recommendations for breeding of this critically endangered species.},

Title = {Niche-separation and conservation biogeography of Madagascar's
   fork-marked lemurs (Cheirogaleidae: Phaner): Evidence of a new cryptic
   species?},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ecological niche modeling can provide insights into a species'
   demography, ecology and biogeography, and the environmental factors that
   determine them. Exploration of ecological niche models and
   niche-divergence among closely-related and cryptic organisms can also be
   useful for species delineation and discrimination, and such information
   can inform and facilitate conservation of their populations. In this
   study, I used an ecological niche modeling approach to investigate the
   conservation biogeography of the fork-marked lemurs (genus Phaner), a
   group of cryptic, nocturnal primates that are endemic to Madagascar. I
   constructed all ecological niche models in MaxEnt, using a range of
   climatic and habitat-related variables. I examined interspecific
   niche-separation within the Phaner genus, and among two sub-populations
   of P. electromontis, a species which has previously been hypothesized to
   represent two distinct, cryptic taxa. All ecological niche models
   performed well and with high accuracy, and whilst the percentage
   contribution of each environmental variable differed between species,
   the results suggested that climate may be the primary determinant of
   Phaner distribution. Further, all four Phaner species occupied distinct
   ecological niches, a result that was also mirrored in the two P.
   electromontis subpopulations. This suggests that one of the two
   sub-populations may indeed be a distinct, as-yet undescribed species,
   but further genetic and ecological research is needed to substantiate
   this result. Finally, the ecological niche models revealed that only
   23.0\% of the suitable land area for Phaner occurrence within Madagascar
   is forested, limiting the geographic distribution of these lemurs.
   Whilst much of this suitable habitat is thankfully protected,
   deforestation continues throughout Madagascar, and this under-studied
   group of lemurs requires further research attention and continued
   conservation efforts.},

Title = {Disentangling the Possible Drivers of Indri indri Microbiome: A
   Threatened Lemur Species of Madagascar},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {Research on the gut microbiome may help with increasing our
   understanding of primate health with species' ecology, evolution, and
   behavior. In particular, microbiome-related information has the
   potential to clarify ecology issues, providing knowledge in support of
   wild primates conservation and their associated habitats. Indri (Indri
   indri) is the largest extant living lemur of Madagascar. This species is
   classified as ``critically endangered{''} by the IUCN Red List of
   Threatened Species, representing one of the world's 25 most endangered
   primates. Indris diet is mainly folivorous, but these primates
   frequently and voluntarily engage in geophagy. Indris have never been
   successfully bred under human care, suggesting that some behavioral
   and/or ecological factors are still not considered from the ex situ
   conservation protocols. Here, we explored gut microbiome composition of
   18 indris belonging to 5 different family groups. The most represented
   phyla were Proteobacteria 40.1 +/- 9.5\%, Bacteroidetes 28.7 +/- 2.8\%,
   Synergistetes 16.7 +/- 4.5\%, and Firmicutes 11.1 +/- 1.9\%. Further,
   our results revealed that bacterial alpha and beta diversity were
   influenced by indri family group and sex. In addition, we investigated
   the chemical composition of geophagic soil to explore the possible
   ecological value of soil as a nutrient supply. The quite acidic pH and
   high levels of secondary oxide-hydroxides of the soils could play a role
   in the folivorous diet's gut detoxification activity. In addition, the
   high contents of iron and manganese found the soils could act as
   micronutrients in the indris' diet. Nevertheless, the concentration of a
   few elements (i.e., calcium, sulfur, boron, nickel, sodium, and
   chromium) was higher in non-geophagic than in geophagic soils. In
   conclusion, the data presented herein provide a baseline for outlining
   some possible drivers responsible for the gut microbiome diversity in
   indris, thus laying the foundations for developing further strategies
   involved in indris' conservation.},

Abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms by which similar species coexist in
   sympatry is a major driver of ecological research. Niche partitioning
   and ecological plasticity can facilitate spatial and habitat use overlap
   between generalist and specialist species. Mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   spp.) are a highly speciose group of small primates that are endemic to
   the forests of Madagascar. In northwestern Madagascar, the relatively
   widespread M. murinus occurs sympatrically with the microendemic M.
   ravelobensis. We investigated spatial distributions and densities of
   these two species across a mangrove-dry forest habitat gradient in
   Mariarano commune. We used capturemark-recapture techniques and
   nocturnal line transect surveys along six transects during June and July
   2017. Spatial capture-recapture and distance sampling models were used
   to estimate lemur densities across habitat types. The congeners
   displayed differential patterns of spatial distribution and densities.
   Microcebus murinus was found in similar densities across all habitat
   types, while M. ravelobensis was found at much higher densities in dry
   forests compared with mangroves. This suggests that the generalist M.
   murinus uses a wider array of habitats more evenly than the specialist
   M. ravelobensis. Our study provides empirical evidence of how cryptic
   lemur species differ in their habitat use and distribution across an
   environmental gradient and provides new insights into their ecology in
   an understudied habitat. Lemurs arc one of the most threatened groups of
   mammals in the world, and understanding how these species are
   distributed across different forest types is crucial for planning and
   implementing conservation measures to protect lemur habitat.},

Title = {Oscillatory Activity in Mouse Lemur Primary Motor Cortex During Natural
   Locomotor Behavior},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {In arboreal environments, substrate orientation determines the
   biomechanical strategy for postural maintenance and locomotion. In this
   study, we investigated possible neuronal correlates of these mechanisms
   in an ancestral primate model, the gray mouse lemur. We conducted
   telemetric recordings of electrocorticographic activity in left primary
   motor cortex of two mouse lemurs moving on a branch-like small-diameter
   pole, fixed horizontally, or vertically. Analysis of cortical
   oscillations in high beta (25-35 Hz) and low gamma (35-50 Hz) bands
   showed stronger resting power on horizontal than vertical substrate,
   potentially illustrating sensorimotor processes for postural
   maintenance. Locomotion on horizontal substrate was associated with
   stronger event-related desynchronization than vertical substrate, which
   could relate to locomotor adjustments and/or derive from differences in
   baseline activity. Spectrograms of cortical activity showed modulation
   throughout individual locomotor cycles, with higher values in the first
   than second half cycle. However, substrate orientation did not
   significantly influence these variations. Overall, these results confirm
   that specific cortical mechanisms are solicited during arboreal
   locomotion, whereby mouse lemurs adjust cortical activity to substrate
   orientation during static posture and locomotion, and modulate this
   activity throughout locomotor cycles.},

Abstract = {The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus, GML) is a nocturnal, arboreal,
   prosimian primate that is native to Madagascar. Captive breeding
   colonies of GMLs have been established primarily for noninvasive studies
   on questions related to circadian rhythms and metabolism. GMLs are
   increasingly considered to be a strong translational model for
   neurocognitive aging due to overlapping histopathologic features shared
   with aged humans. However, little information is available describing
   the clinical presentations, naturally occurring diseases, and
   histopathology of aged GMLs. In our colony, a 9 y-old, male, GML was
   euthanized after sudden onset of weakness, lethargy, and tibial
   fracture. Evaluation of this animal revealed widespread fibrous
   osteodystrophy (FOD) of the mandible, maxilla, cranium, appendicular,
   and vertebral bones. FOD and systemic metastatic mineralization were
   attributed to underlying chronic renal disease. Findings in this GML
   prompted periodic colony-wide serum biochemical screenings for azotemia
   and electrolyte abnormalities. Subsequently, 3 additional GMLs (2
   females and 1 male) were euthanized due to varying clinical and serum
   biochemical presentations. Common to all 4 animals were FOD, chronic
   renal disease, uterine adenocarcinoma (females only), cataracts, and
   osteoarthritis. This case study highlights the concurrent clinical and
   histopathologic abnormalities that are relevant to use of GMLs in the
   expanding field of aging research.},

Title = {Lemur paparazzi: Arboreal camera trapping and occupancy modeling as
   conservation tools for monitoring threatened lemur species},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Primate species face growing risks of extinction throughout the world.
   To better protect their populations, effective monitoring techniques are
   needed. The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of arboreal
   camera traps and occupancy modeling as conservation tools for threatened
   lemur species. This project aimed to (1) estimate the occupancy and
   detection probabilities of lemur species, (2) investigate factors
   potentially affecting lemur habitat use, and (3) determine whether
   ground or arboreal cameras are better for surveying lemur assemblages.
   We conducted camera trapping research in five forest fragments (total
   trap nights = 1770; 900 arboreal trap nights (134 photo events); 870
   ground trap nights (2 photo events)) and reforestation areas (total trap
   nights = 608; 1 photo event) in Kianjavato, Madagascar from May to
   September 2019. We used arboreal trap data from fragments to estimate
   occupancy for five species: the red-fronted brown lemur (Eulemur
   rufifrons; psi = 0.54 +/- SD 0.03), Jolly's mouse lemur (Microcebus
   jollyae; psi = 0.14 +/- 0.17), the greater dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus
   major; psi = 0.42 +/- 0.30), the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer;
   psi = 0.24 +/- 0.03), and the black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia
   variegata; psi = 0.24 +/- 0.08). Tree diameter, elevation, distance to
   village, and canopy connectivity were important predictors of occupancy,
   while camera height, canopy connectivity, fragment ID, and fragment size
   predicted detection. Arboreal cameras recorded significantly higher
   species richness compared with ground cameras. We suggest expanded
   application of arboreal camera traps in future research, but we
   recommend longer trapping periods to better sample rarer species.
   Overall, arboreal camera trapping combined with occupancy modeling can
   be a highly efficient and useful approach for monitoring and predicting
   the occurrence of elusive lemur species and has the potential to be
   effective for other arboreal primates and canopy taxa across the globe.},

Title = {Exploring the behavioral reactions to a mirror in the nocturnal grey
   mouse lemur: sex differences in avoidance},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 13},
Abstract = {Most mirror-image stimulation studies (MIS) have been conducted on
   social and diurnal animals in order to explore self-recognition, social
   responses, and personality traits. Small, nocturnal mammals are
   difficult to study in the wild and are underrepresented in experimental
   behavioral studies. In this pilot study, we explored the behavioral
   reaction of a small nocturnal solitary forager-the grey mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus)-an emergent animal model in captivity. We assessed
   whether MIS can be used to detect a repeatable behavioral reaction,
   whether individuals will present a similar reaction toward a conspecific
   and the mirror, and whether males and females respond similarly. We
   tested 12 individuals (six males and six females) twice in three
   different contexts: with a mirror, with a live conspecific, and with a
   white board as a neutral control. We detected significant repeatability
   for the activity component of the behavioral reaction. There was a
   significant effect of the context and the interaction between
   presentation context and sex for avoidance during the first session for
   males but not for females. Males avoided the mirror more than they
   avoided a live conspecific. This pilot study opens a discussion on the
   behavioral differences between males and females regarding social
   interactions and reproduction in the nocturnal solitary species, and
   suggests that males are more sensitive to context of stimulation than
   females.},

Title = {Using Utilitarian Plants for Lemur Conservation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Abstract = {Nature and species conservation often conflict with intensive natural
   resource or land use. Many protected areas are too small for long-term
   conservation of viable vertebrate populations, especially in Madagascar,
   and forests are subject to exploitation for a variety of natural
   resources. Trying to exclude people from the use of these resources has
   not been successful during economic, natural, or political crises or
   when human population growth outruns any development effort. People need
   economic and other benefits, and conservation measures have to account
   for these needs. We compiled native and introduced tree, shrub, and
   herbaceous species used by both people and native vertebrates for three
   regions, covering the domains of the dry, transitional, and humid forest
   of Madagascar. We carried out semistructured interviews and group
   discussions in 12 different villages in each study region in November
   2017. People listed 139 utilitarian plant taxa. Our literature search
   revealed that 72 of these plant species and 13 genera used by people,
   were also used by 208 different terrestrial vertebrates including 58
   lemur species. Application of the Forest Landscape Restoration approach
   with a combination of exotic and native plant species used by both
   people and animals could increase the economic value of restored forest
   habitats for people, thus providing incentives for forest conservation.
   Plantations of mixed utilitarian trees and shrubs could be integrated
   into agricultural landscapes. Among land-living vertebrates, lemurs seem
   to benefit most from this approach. These measures might contribute to a
   successful array of biodiversity conservation in anthropogenic
   landscapes.},

Title = {Endogenization of a Prosimian Retrovirus during Lemur Evolution},
Journal = {VIRUSES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Studies of viruses that coevolved with lemurs provide an opportunity to
   understand the basal traits of primate viruses and provide an
   evolutionary context for host-virus interactions. Germline integration
   of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are fossil evidence of past
   infections. Hence, characterization of novel ERVs provides insight into
   the ancient precursors of extant viruses and the evolutionary history of
   their hosts. Here, we report the discovery of a novel endogenous
   retrovirus present in the genome of a lemur, Coquerel's sifaka
   (Propithecus coquereli). Using next-generation sequencing, we identified
   and characterized the complete genome sequence of a retrovirus, named
   prosimian retrovirus 1 (PSRV1). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that
   PSRV1 is a gamma-type betaretrovirus basal to the other primate
   betaretroviruses and most closely related to simian retroviruses.
   Molecular clock analysis of PSRV1 long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences
   estimated the time of endogenization within 4.56 MYA (+/- 2.4 MYA),
   placing it after the divergence of Propithecus species. These results
   indicate that PSRV1 is an important milestone of lemur evolution during
   the radiation of the Propithecus genus. These findings may have
   implications for both human and animal health in that the acquisition of
   a gamma-type env gene within an endogenized betaretrovirus could
   facilitate a cross-species jump between vertebrate class hosts.},

Volume = {58},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Madagascar is a hotspot of biodiversity, but poverty and population
   growth provoke a high risk of conflict between food security and
   biodiversity conservation in this tropical country. Numerous
   vector-borne diseases, including viral infections, affect public health
   in Madagascar and a continuous expansion of anthropogenically used areas
   intensifies contact on the human-wildlife interface. However, data on
   human and animal pathogens in potential insect vectors is limited.
   Therefore, we conducted a parasitological and virological survey of 785
   adult female mosquitoes between March and May 2016 at the Ankarafantsika
   National Park in northwestern Madagascar. Screening included Alpha-,
   Phlebo-, and Flaviviridae and the recently described filarial nematode
   species, Lemurfilaria lemuris. The predominant mosquito genus was Culex
   (91\%), followed by Mansonia (4.1\%), Anopheles (3.4\%), and Aedes
   (0.9\%). Viral screening revealed no arboviruses, but an insect-specific
   flavivirus in two Culex sitiens pools. No pools screened positive for
   the lemur-specific filarial nematode L. lemuris.

Title = {Activity budget, home range and diet of the Colombian night monkey
   (Aotus lemurinus) in peri-urban forest fragments},
Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {62},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Forest fragmentation and deforestation are major threats to primates at
   a global scale. The survival of primates in forest fragments largely
   depends on their behavioral and dietary flexibility, as well as their
   ability to use a modified matrix in anthropogenic landscapes, hence the
   importance of determining these ecological parameters in habitats with
   strong anthropic interventions. This paper aims to describe the activity
   budget and diet of two groups of the Colombian night monkey (Aotus
   lemurinus) and to estimate their home range in two peri-urban forest
   fragments in the city of Manizales, Colombia. We combined scan sampling
   and handheld GPS fixes in order to determine the behavioral, dietary and
   spatial patterns of the study groups. Night monkeys spent most of their
   time resting and traveling and were mainly frugivorous relying on at
   least 26 plant species in their diet. The most consumed plants included
   Persea americana, Cecropia angustifolia, Musa x paradisiaca, Cecropia
   telenitida, and Croton cf. mutisianus. Two of these plants are
   cultivated species and can provide important resources for populations
   in small forest fragments. Home range sizes were estimated at 1.7 to 1.8
   hectares, using a grid count method. Our results suggest the potential
   adaptability that these primates have when exposed to anthropogenic
   habitat disturbances and habitat degradation. Nonetheless, future
   studies should evaluate the influence of demographic factors and
   resource availability on the behavioral, dietary and spatial patterns of
   A. lemurinus in peri-urban forests, in order to further understand their
   ability to cope with the pervasive processes of habitat fragmentation in
   the northern Andes.},

Abstract = {Most primates live in lowland ecosystems; however, some species have
   been particularly successful at colonizing higher altitudes, such as
   night monkeys (genus Aotus). Studies of the ecology of night monkeys in
   tropical forests are numerous, but behavioral data are limited due to
   the challenges associated with their nocturnal habits. Although Andean
   night monkeys (A. lemurinus) live in mountain forests >1000 m.a.s.l. and
   Caribbean night monkeys (A. griseimembra) live in rainforests <1000
   m.a.s.l., they are found at similar tropical latitudes. Between 2018 and
   2019, we followed three groups of A. lemurinus and one group of A.
   griseimembra at three sites in Colombia and recorded data on their
   ecology and behavior. Although they live at different altitudes, the two
   species had similar activity patterns and diet, investing approximately
   half of the night in resting (48\%), and feeding primarily on fruits. We
   found differences among groups in the time invested in feeding on
   flowers, their home range, and distance traveled per night. These
   differences may be related to the unique characteristics of each study
   site and differences in resource availability and floristic composition
   of forests at different altitudes. Although the most important families
   in their diet were Moraceae and Urticaceae, highland groups also fed
   frequently on a large number of Melastomataceae and Rubiaceae trees.
   This research suggests these two nocturnal primates, living in
   contrasting environments, use similar strategies to cope with the
   challenges of being active at night in tropical forests.},

   together with a high concentration of specific essential micronutrients.
   This could partially explain the role of the soil in detoxification and
   as a nutrient supply. Besides, we found that soil subject to geophagy
   and indris' faeces shared about 8.9\% of the fungal OTUs. Also, several
   genera (e.g. Fusarium, Aspergillus and Penicillium) commonly associated
   with soil and plant material were found in both geophagic soil and indri
   samples. On the contrary, some taxa with pathogenic potentials, such as
   Cryptococcus, were only found in indri samples. Further, many
   saprotrophs and plant-associated fungal taxa were detected in the indri
   faeces. These fungal species may be involved in the digestion processes
   of leaves and could have a beneficial role in their health. In
   conclusion, we found an intimate connection between gut mycobiome and
   soil, highlighting, once again, the potential consequent impacts on the
   wider habitat.},

Title = {Seasonal variability in the diet and feeding ecology of black-and-white
   ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata) in Ranomafana National Park,

Abstract = {Objectives: We characterized the diet and foraging ecology of the
   black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata), a specialized
   frugivore, and investigated behavioral strategies exhibited in response
   to seasonal changes in resource availability.
   Materials and Methods: Behavioral data were collected from the same two
   adjacent communities across 29 months during two observation periods
   (2007-2008; 2017-2018) in Mangevo, a primary rainforest habitat in
   southeastern Madagascar. To analyze feeding in the context of energy
   maximization versus time minimization strategies, we used nonparametric
   tests to compare plant part constituents, dietary diversity, activity
   budgets, and canopy strata use between fruit-abundant versus fruit-lean
   seasons.
   Results: Individuals dedicated similar to 30\% of their time to feeding
   year-round, mostly in the middle canopy (11-20 m). Animals fed primarily
   on fruits (74\% of diet), but frugivory decreased and folivory increased
   markedly during fruit-lean seasons. Abundant season dietary diversity
   (98 taxa, H ` = 0.71-1.37) was greater than lean season diversity (70
   taxa, H ` = 0.56-1.06), which coincided with less traveling, more
   resting, and higher canopy use-though interannual variation was
   observed.
   Conclusions: Herein, we describe behavioral and dietary patterns that
   are concordant with a time minimizing behavioral strategy.
   Black-and-white ruffed lemur diets comprised lower taxonomic diversity,
   fewer fruits, and more leaves during fruit-lean months. Further, shifts
   toward less travel, more resting, and greater use of higher canopy
   levels during this time were most likely for thermoregulatory benefits.},
