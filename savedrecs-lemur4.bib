Title = {Predation on Subfossil Prolemur simus by Multiple Predator Species at
   Ankarana Massif, Northern Madagascar},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {58-79},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Evidence of historic predation is important to understand the role that
   predators play in molding fundamental aspects of primate biology. We
   examined the geographic demise of Prolemur simus from the perspective of
   its past behavioral ecology. Using paleontological data from the Late
   Pleistocene-Holocene deposits at Ankarana Massif, northern Madagascar,
   we test the hypothesis that 1) multiple predators preyed on P. simus in
   the past and 2) the dietary preferences and habitat preferences of
   subfossil P. simus were similar to its extant counterpart. We examined
   381 subfossil craniodental remains of P. simus from Ankarana. We used
   dental eruption and macrowear to assign craniodental remains to relative
   age classes, and carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable
   isotope values in bone collagen to assess variation in this species'
   diet and habitat. Skeletal evidence of predation suggests that multiple
   predators consumed P. simus in the past. Evidence for carnivoran
   predatory activity includes punctures on the viscerocranium, posterior
   neurocranium, and angle of the mandible. Evidence for raptor predatory
   activity includes talon nicks, punctures, and ``can-opener{''}
   perforations within the orbits or palate. Stable isotope data suggest
   that the diet of P. simus was remarkably similar among localities
   inhabited by this species before human arrival, despite varied
   environmental conditions. These data suggest that P. simus was likely
   codistributed with large-culmed bamboo in the past as it is today. The
   synergistic effects of predation and habitat change may explain the
   biogeographic retreat of P. simus to its present-day distribution in
   eastern Madagascar. The study of predator-primate dynamics and
   interactions across contiguous and fragmented forests will increase our
   understanding of the impact of such dynamics on primate evolution, and
   improve primate conservation efforts more broadly.},

Title = {Strepsirrhine Primate Training Programs in North American Institutions:
   Status and Implications for Future Welfare Assessment},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Training techniques are based on operant conditioning
   learning (the behavior is modified by its consequences). In many
   nonhuman primate species, they have been used to influence animals to
   perform specific behaviors voluntarily and cooperate with routine
   husbandry and veterinary procedures. However, the information regarding
   the suborder of strepsirrhine primates (lemurs, lorises, and galagos) is
   scarce. We assessed the development and current status of training
   programs with these species in North American institutions through an
   online survey. We collected information related to training program
   details; animals, behaviors, and techniques; the evaluation process; and
   the impact of training. Seventy-one organizations completed the survey,
   with results showing that 97\% trained their strepsirrhines with the
   main objectives of husbandry and veterinary care (around 80\%).
   Sixty-eight percent of organizations did not report any risk in training
   these species. The benefits reported include increases in positive
   human-animal interactions, psychological well-being, and staff awareness
   of animal behaviors, supporting the success of these programs in
   providing optimal care for these nonhuman primates. However, we need to
   improve our understanding of the impact of training on the welfare of
   strepsirrhine primates, and we hope that the data offered in this survey
   can help in this future assessment. Many articles have shown the
   benefits of operant conditioning training techniques in the care and
   welfare of several species of nonhuman primates; however, the
   information regarding their use in strepsirrhine species is scarce. We
   assessed the development and current status of training programs with
   these species in North American institutions. An online survey was
   distributed through members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums
   using a multiple-choice format. We collected information related to
   training program details; animals, behaviors, and techniques; the
   evaluation process; and the impact of training. Seventy-one
   organizations completed the survey, with the results showing that 97\%
   of respondents trained their strepsirrhines with the main objective of
   husbandry and veterinary care (around 80\%). Sixty-eight percent of
   organizations did not report any risk in training these species. The
   benefits reported include increases in positive human-animal
   interactions (97\%), psychological well-being (88\%), and staff
   awareness of animal behaviors (90\%). However, a multi-dimensional
   approach to measure the efficacy of training could provide a deeper
   understanding of its impact on the welfare of strepsirrhine primates. We
   hope that the data offered in this survey can help in this future
   assessment.},

   for folivory and high heterozygosity despite endangered status},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {17},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Sifakas (genus Propithecus) are critically endangered, large-bodied
   diurnal lemurs that eat leaf-based diets and show corresponding
   anatomical and microbial adaptations to folivory. We report on the
   genome assembly of Coquerel's sifaka (P. coquereli) and the resequenced
   genomes of Verreaux's (P. verreauxi), the golden-crowned (P.
   tattersalli), and the diademed (P. diadema) sifakas. We find high
   heterozygosity in all sifakas compared with other primates and
   endangered mammals. Demographic reconstructions nevertheless suggest
   declines in effective population size beginning before human arrival on
   Madagascar. Comparative genomic analyses indicate pervasive accelerated
   evolution in the ancestral sifaka lineage affecting genes in several
   complementary pathways relevant to folivory, including nutrient
   absorption and xenobiotic and fatty acid metabolism. Sifakas show
   convergent evolution at the level of the pathway, gene family, gene, and
   amino acid substitution with other folivores. Although sifakas have
   relatively generalized diets, the physiological challenges of habitual
   folivory likely led to strong selection.},

Title = {Headfirst descent behaviors in a comparative sample of strepsirrhine
   primates},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {83},
Number = {6, SI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The ability to safely ascend and descend is critical to the success of
   arboreal animals. Nonprimate mammals typically descend supports
   headfirst aided by their claws, but primates must rely on grasping, and
   use a variety of behaviors to move down within an arboreal environment,
   including headfirst and tailfirst descending. This study assesses
   hypothesized body mass limits on vertical headfirst descent and
   identifies approximate support orientations and diameters at which
   headfirst descent is ceased in a sample of nine strepsirrhines species
   ranging in mass from 0.06 to 4.5 kg. Species under 1 kg, arboreal
   quadrupeds Cheirogaleus medius and Microcebus murinus, and slow climber
   Nycticebus pygmaeus, always descended supports headfirst regardless of
   orientation and diameter as long as a grasp could be established.
   Arboreal quadrupedal species above 1 kg, Daubetonia madagascariensis,
   Eulemur coronatus, Eulemur mongoz, Lemur catta, and Varecia variegata
   differed in the orientation at which they ceased using headfirst descent
   and the types of alternative descending behaviors they employed. Lemur
   catta, a highly terrestrial species, started to employ tailfirst
   descents at 45 degrees and completely stopped using headfirst descent on
   steeper and thicker supports. Other arboreal quadrupeds, D.
   madagascariensis, E. coronatus, E. mongoz, and V. variegata, began using
   tailfirst descent at 60 degrees. The vertical clinging and leaping
   species Propithecus coquereli rarely engaged in above branch
   quadrupedalism, and individuals were observed using tailfirst descents
   on supports as shallow as 15 degrees. This study shows the ways in which
   mass and anatomy may constrain use of headfirst descent through arboreal
   environments, and the alternate strategies strepsirrhine primates employ
   to descend.},

Title = {Neural correlates of mating system diversity: oxytocin and vasopressin
   receptor distributions in monogamous and non-monogamous Eulemur},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Contemporary theory that emphasizes the roles of oxytocin and
   vasopressin in mammalian sociality has been shaped by seminal vole
   research that revealed interspecific variation in neuroendocrine
   circuitry by mating system. However, substantial challenges exist in
   interpreting and translating these rodent findings to other mammalian
   groups, including humans, making research on nonhuman primates crucial.
   Both monogamous and non-monogamous species exist within Eulemur, a genus
   of strepsirrhine primate, offering a rare opportunity to broaden a
   comparative perspective on oxytocin and vasopressin neurocircuitry with
   increased evolutionary relevance to humans. We performed oxytocin and
   arginine vasopressin 1a receptor autoradiography on 12 Eulemur brains
   from seven closely related species to (1) characterize receptor
   distributions across the genus, and (2) examine differences between
   monogamous and non-monogamous species in regions part of putative
   ``pair-bonding circuits{''}. We find some binding patterns across
   Eulemur reminiscent of olfactory-guided rodents, but others congruent
   with more visually oriented anthropoids, consistent with lemurs
   occupying an `intermediary' evolutionary niche between haplorhine
   primates and other mammalian groups. We find little evidence of a
   ``pair-bonding circuit{''} in Eulemur akin to those proposed in previous
   rodent or primate research. Mapping neuropeptide receptors in these
   nontraditional species questions existing assumptions and informs
   proposed evolutionary explanations about the biological bases of
   monogamy.},

Abstract = {Previous descriptive work on deciduous dentition of primates has focused
   disproportionately on great apes and humans. To address this bias in the
   literature, we studied 131 subadult nonhominoid specimens (including 110
   newborns) describing deciduous tooth morphology and assessing maximum
   hydroxyapatite density (MHD). All specimens were CT scanned at 70 kVp
   and reconstructed at 20.5-39 mu m voxels. Grayscale intensity from scans
   was converted to hydroxyapatite (HA) density (mg HA/cm(3)) using a
   linear conversion of grayscale values to calibration standards of known
   HA density (R-2 = .99). Using Amira software, mineralized dental tissues
   were captured by segmenting the tooth cusps first and then capturing the
   remainder of the teeth at descending thresholds of gray levels. We
   assessed the relationship of MHD of selected teeth to cranial length
   using Pearson correlation coefficients. In monkeys, anterior teeth are
   more mineralized than postcanine teeth. In tarsiers and most lemurs and
   lorises, postcanine teeth are the most highly mineralized. This suggests
   that monkeys have a more prolonged process of dental mineralization that
   begins with incisors and canines, while mineralization of postcanine
   teeth is delayed. This may in part be a result of relatively late
   weaning in most anthropoid primates. Results also reveal that in lemurs
   and lorises, MHD of the mandibular first permanent molar (M-1)
   negatively correlates with cranial length. In contrast, the MHD of M-1
   positively correlates with cranial length in monkeys. This supports the
   hypothesis that natural selection acts independently on dental growth as
   opposed to mineralization and indicates clear phylogenetic differences
   among primates.},

Abstract = {Living nonhuman primates generally inhabit tropical forests, and torpor
   is regarded as a strategy employed by cold-adapted organisms. Yet, some
   primates employ daily torpor or hibernation (heterothermy) under
   obligatory, temporary, or emergency circumstances. Though heterothermy
   is present in most mammalian lineages, there are only three extant
   heterothermic primate lineages: bushbabies from Africa, lorises from
   Asia, and dwarf and mouse lemurs from Madagascar. Here, we analyze their
   phenotypes in the general context of tropical mammalian heterothermy. We
   focus on Malagasy lemurs as they have been the most intensively studied
   and also show an unmatched range of flexibility in their heterothermic
   responses. We discuss the evidence for whether heterothermy should be
   considered an ancestral or derived condition in primates. This
   consideration is particularly intriguing given that an understanding of
   the underlying mechanisms for hibernation in lemurs opens the
   possibility for insight into genotype-phenotype interactions, including
   those with biomedical relevance for humans.},

Title = {Bamboo Specialists from Two Mammalian Orders (Primates, Carnivora) Share
   a High Number of Low-Abundance Gut Microbes},

Volume = {76},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {Bamboo specialization is one of the most extreme examples of convergent
   herbivory, yet it is unclear how this specific high-fiber diet might
   selectively shape the composition of the gut microbiome compared to host
   phylogeny. To address these questions, we used deep sequencing to
   investigate the nature and comparative impact of phylogenetic and
   dietary selection for specific gut microbial membership in three bamboo
   specialists-the bamboo lemur (Hapalemur griseus, Primates: Lemuridae),
   giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, Carnivora: Ursidae), and red panda
   (Ailurus fulgens, Carnivora: Musteloideadae), as well as two
   phylogenetic controls-the ringtail lemur (Lemur catta) and the Asian
   black bear (Ursus thibetanus). We detected significantly higher Shannon
   diversity in the bamboo lemur (10.029) compared to both the giant panda
   (8.256; p = 0.0001936) and the red panda (6.484; p = 0.0000029). We also
   detected significantly enriched bacterial taxa that distinguished each
   species. Our results complement previous work in finding that phylogeny
   predominantly governs high-level microbiome community structure.
   However, we also find that 48 low-abundance OTUs are shared among bamboo
   specialists, compared to only 8 OTUs shared by the bamboo lemur and its
   sister species, the ringtail lemur (Lemur catta, a generalist). Our
   results suggest that deep sequencing is necessary to detect
   low-abundance bacterial OTUs, which may be specifically adapted to a
   high-fiber diet. These findings provide a more comprehensive framework
   for understanding the evolution and ecology of the microbiome as well as
   the host.},

Abstract = {This article is part of a Special Issue (Chemosignals and Reproduction).
   As highly visual animals, primates, in general, and Old World species
   (including humans), in particular, are not immediately recognized for
   reliance in their daily interactions on olfactory communication.
   Nevertheless, views on primate olfactory acuity and the pervasiveness of
   their scent signaling are changing, with increased appreciation for the
   important role of body odors in primate social and sexual behavior. All
   major taxonomic groups, from lemurs to humans, are endowed with
   scent-producing organs, and either deposit or exude a wealth of volatile
   compounds, many of which are known semiochemicals. This review takes a
   comparative perspective to illustrate the reproductive context of
   primate signaling, the relevant information content of their signals,
   the sexually differentiated investigative responses generated, and the
   behavioral or physiological consequences of message transmission to both
   signaler and receiver. Throughout, humans are placed alongside their
   relatives to illustrate the evolutionary continuum in the sexual
   selection of primate chemosignals. This ever-growing body of evidence
   points to a critical role of scent in guiding the social behavior and
   reproductive function throughout the primate order. (C) 2014 Published

Abstract = {Latrine use (i.e., the repeated use of specific defecation/urination
   sites) has been described for several mammals, including carnivores,
   ungulates, and primates. However, the functional significance of latrine
   use in primates has not been studied systematically yet. We, therefore,
   followed 14 radio-collared individuals of the pair-living white-footed
   sportive lemur (Lepilemur leucopus) for 1097 hours of continuous focal
   observations to investigate latrine distribution, seasonality of latrine
   use, as well as age and sex of users to test various hypotheses related
   to possible functions of latrine use, including territory demarcation,
   resource defense, signaling of reproductive state, social bonding, and
   mate defense. All individuals of a social unit exhibited communal use of
   latrines located in the core area of their territory, supporting the
   social boding hypothesis. Latrine use seems to facilitate familiarity
   and social bonding within social units via olfactory communication in
   this primate that lives in family units but exhibits low levels of
   spatial cohesion and direct social interactions. In addition, frequency
   of latrine visitation was higher during nights of perceived intruder
   pressure, supporting the mate defense hypothesis. However, animals did
   not react to experimentally introduced feces from neighboring or strange
   social units, indicating that urine may be the more important component
   of latrines than feces in this arboreal species. Based on a survey of
   latrine use and function in other mammals, we conclude that latrines
   facilitate communication particularly in nocturnal species with limited
   habitat visibility and in species where individuals are not permanently
   cohesive because they constitute predictable areas for information
   exchange.},

Title = {Socioecological and phylogenetic patterns in the chemical signals of
   strepsirrhine primates},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {249-253},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Our understanding of chemical signals in mammals derives principally
   from studies in which researchers examine signal structure or function
   within a single species. Despite the unique information to be gained
   from applying comparable methods across multiple species, comparative
   studies of chemical signals are extremely limited. Here, we review the
   available literature on the evolution of chemosignals in male and female
   strepsirrhine primates (galagos, lorises and lemurs), all of which rely
   heavily on chemical communication. We draw from a few case studies, but
   focus our review on two comparative studies. In one, researchers
   examined the volatile chemical composition of urinary signals across 12
   species representing most families within Strepsirrhini, including six
   `urine-marking' species and six glandular or `nonurine-marking' species.
   In the other, researchers examined the volatile chemical composition of
   glandular signals in eight Eulemur species differing in social or
   dominance structure. We highlight five findings. (1) Regardless of the
   scent source, chemical profiles differ substantially between species,
   providing reliable species `scent signatures'. None the less, (2) urine
   markers express more compounds and have more distinguishable species
   scent signatures in their urine than do nonurine markers, suggesting
   specialization of function. Within Eulemur (3) chemical richness is
   greater in multimale-multifemale species than in pair-bonded species.
   Moreover, (4) whereas chemical richness of male signals is greater in
   sexually codominant species, chemical richness of female signals is
   greater in female-dominant species. Together, the findings from both
   comparative studies, coupled with case studies, suggest that signal
   richness is linked to some aspect of the focal species' socioecology.
   Lastly, (5) regardless of the scent source, strepsirrhine chemosignals
   evolve gradually over time, but at fast rates and homogeneously within
   different lineages. Comparative studies reveal patterns that cannot be
   detected from the single-species approach and are therefore critical for
   providing new insight into the function and evolution of olfactory
   signals. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {Mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) are an exciting new primate model for
   understanding human aging and disease. In captivity, Microcebus murinus
   develops human-like ailments of old age after five years (e.g.,
   neurodegeneration analogous to Alzheimer's disease) but can live beyond
   12 years. It is believed that wild Microcebus follow a similar pattern
   of senescence observed in captive animals, but that predation limits
   their lifespan to four years, thus preventing observance of these
   diseases in the wild. Testing whether this assumption is true is
   informative about both Microcebus natural history and environmental
   influences on senescence, leading to interpretation of findings for
   models of human aging. Additionally, the study of Microcebus longevity
   provides an opportunity to better understand mechanisms of sex-biased
   longevity. Longevity is often shorter in males of species with high
   male-male competition, such as Microcebus, but mouse lemurs are sexually
   monomorphic, suggesting similar lifespans. We collected individual-based
   observations of wild brown mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus) from
   2003-2010 to investigate sex-differences in survival and longevity.
   Fecal testosterone was measured as a potential mechanism of sex-based
   differences in survival. We used a combination of high-resolution tooth
   wear techniques, mark-recapture, and hormone enzyme immunoassays. We
   found no dental or physical signs of senescence in M. rufus as old as
   eight years (N = 189, ages 1-8, mean = 2.59 +/- 1.63 SE), three years
   older than captive, senescent congeners (M. murinus). Unlike other
   polygynandrous vertebrates, we found no sex difference in age-dependent
   survival, nor sex or age differences in testosterone levels. While
   elevated male testosterone levels have been implicated in shorter
   lifespans in several species, this is one of the first studies to show
   equivalent testosterone levels accompanying equivalent lifespans. Future
   research on captive aged individuals can determine if senescence is
   partially a condition of their captive environment, and studies
   controlling for various environmental factors will further our
   understanding of senescence.},

Title = {Love is in the air: sociality and pair bondedness influence sifaka
   reproductive signalling},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {147-156},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Social complexity, often estimated by group size, is seen as driving the
   complexity of vocal signals, but its relation to olfactory signals,
   which arguably arose to function in nonsocial realms, remains
   underappreciated. That olfactory signals also may mediate within-group
   interaction, vary with social complexity and promote social cohesion
   underscores a potentially crucial link with sociality. To examine that
   link, we integrated chemical and behavioural analyses to ask whether
   olfactory signals facilitate reproductive coordination in a
   strepsirrhine primate, the Coquerel's sifaka, Propithecus coquereli.
   Belonging to a clade comprising primarily solitary, nocturnal species,
   the diurnal, group-living sifaka represents an interesting test case.
   Convergent with diurnal, group-living lemurids, sifakas expressed
   chemically rich scent signals, consistent with the social complexity
   hypothesis for communication. These signals minimally encoded the sex of
   the signaller and varied with female reproductive state. Likewise, sex
   and female fertility were reflected in within-group scent investigation,
   scent marking and overmarking. We further asked whether, within breeding
   pairs, the stability or quality of the pair's bond influences the
   composition of glandular signals and patterns of investigatory or
   scent-marking behaviour. Indeed, reproductively successful pairs tended
   to show greater similarity in their scent signals than did
   reproductively unsuccessful pairs, potentially through chemical
   convergence. Moreover, scent marking was temporally coordinated within
   breeding pairs and was influenced by past reproductive success. That
   olfactory signalling reflects social bondedness or reproductive history
   lends support to recent suggestions that the quality of relationships
   may be a more valuable proxy than group size for estimating social
   complexity. We suggest that olfactory signalling in sifakas is more
   complex than previously recognized and, as in other socially integrated
   species, can be a crucial mechanism for promoting group cohesion and
   maintaining social bonds. Thus, the evolution of sociality may well be
   reflected in the complexity of olfactory signalling. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {Classic sex roles depict females as choosy, but polyandry is widespread.
   Empirical attempts to understand the evolution of polyandry have often
   focused on its adaptive value to females, whereas `convenience
   polyandry' might simply decrease the costs of sexual harassment. We
   tested whether constraint-free female strategies favour promiscuity over
   mating selectivity through an original experimental design. We
   investigated variation in mating behaviour in response to a reversible
   alteration of sexual dimorphism in body mass in the grey mouse lemur, a
   small primate where female brief sexual receptivity allows quantifying
   polyandry. We manipulated body condition in captive females, predicting
   that convenience polyandry would increase when females are weaker than
   males, thus less likely to resist their solicitations. Our results
   rather support the alternative hypothesis of `adaptive polyandry':
   females in better condition are more polyandrous. Furthermore, we reveal
   that multiple mating incurs significant energetic costs, which are
   strikingly symmetrical between the sexes. Our study shows that mouse
   lemur females exert tight control over mating and actively seek multiple
   mates. The benefits of remating are nevertheless not offset by its costs
   in low-condition females, suggesting that polyandry is a flexible
   strategy yielding moderate fitness benefits in this small mammal.},

   species. For the majority of nonhuman primates, including some of the
   most critically endangered, genome-level data are not yet available. In
   this study, we have taken the first steps toward addressing this gap by
   sequencing RNA from the livers of multiple individuals from each of 16
   mammalian species, including humans and 11 nonhuman primates. Of the
   nonhuman primate species, five are lemurs and two are lorisoids, for
   which little or no genomic data were previously available. To analyze
   these data, we developed a method for de novo assembly and alignment of
   orthologous gene sequences across species. We assembled an average of
   5721 gene sequences per species and characterized diversity and
   divergence of both gene sequences and gene expression levels. We
   identified patterns of variation that are consistent with the action of
   positive or directional selection, including an 18-fold enrichment of
   peroxisomal genes among genes whose regulation likely evolved under
   directional selection in the ancestral primate lineage. Importantly, we
   found no relationship between genetic diversity and endangered status,
   with the two most endangered species in our study, the black and white
   ruffed lemur and the Coquerel's sifaka, having the highest genetic
   diversity among all primates. Our observations imply that many
   endangered lemur populations still harbor considerable genetic
   variation. Timely efforts to conserve these species alongside their
   habitats have, therefore, strong potential to achieve long-term success.},

Title = {Decoding an olfactory mechanism of kin recognition and inbreeding
   avoidance in a primate},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 3},
Abstract = {Background: Like other vertebrates, primates recognize their relatives,
   primarily to minimize inbreeding, but also to facilitate nepotism.
   Although associative, social learning is typically credited for
   discrimination of familiar kin, discrimination of unfamiliar kin remains
   unexplained. As sex-biased dispersal in long-lived species cannot
   consistently prevent encounters between unfamiliar kin, inbreeding
   remains a threat and mechanisms to avoid it beg explanation. Using a
   molecular approach that combined analyses of biochemical and
   microsatellite markers in 17 female and 19 male ring-tailed lemurs
   (Lemur catta), we describe odor-gene covariance to establish the
   feasibility of olfactory-mediated kin recognition.
   Results: Despite derivation from different genital glands, labial and
   scrotal secretions shared about 170 of their respective 338 and 203
   semiochemicals. In addition, these semiochemicals encoded information
   about genetic relatedness within and between the sexes. Although the
   sexes showed opposite seasonal patterns in signal complexity, the odor
   profiles of related individuals (whether same-sex or mixed-sex dyads)
   converged most strongly in the competitive breeding season. Thus, a
   strong, mutual olfactory signal of genetic relatedness appeared
   specifically when such information would be crucial for preventing
   inbreeding. That weaker signals of genetic relatedness might exist year
   round could provide a mechanism to explain nepotism between unfamiliar
   kin.
   Conclusion: We suggest that signal convergence between the sexes may
   reflect strong selective pressures on kin recognition, whereas signal
   convergence within the sexes may arise as its by-product or function
   independently to prevent competition between unfamiliar relatives. The
   link between an individual's genome and its olfactory signals could be
   mediated by biosynthetic pathways producing polymorphic semiochemicals
   or by carrier proteins modifying the individual bouquet of olfactory
   cues. In conclusion, we unveil a possible olfactory mechanism of kin
   recognition that has specific relevance to understanding inbreeding
   avoidance and nepotistic behavior observed in free-ranging primates, and
   broader relevance to understanding the mechanisms of vertebrate
   olfactory communication.},

Title = {Ecogeographic size variation in small-bodied subfossil primates from
   Ankilitelo, Southwestern Madagascar},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {134},
Number = {2},
Pages = {152-161},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Variation in body size is well documented for both extant and extinct
   Malagasy primates, and appears to be correlated with geographic patterns
   of resource seasonality. Less attention has been paid to extant lemurs
   in subfossil collections, although it has been suggested that subfossil
   forms of extant species are characterized by greater size than their
   modern counterpart. This trend of phyletic size change has been related
   to climate change, habitat fragmentation, or human hunting. However,
   space- and time-averaging in the subfossil samples of previous studies
   may have obscured more general ecogeographic patterns underlying these
   size differences. Our objective is to examine size variation in
   subfossil still-extant primates within a regional comparative context to
   determine if subfossil and living forms conform to similar ecogeographic
   patterns. We report on the subfossil still-extant primate assemblage
   from Ankilitelo, southwestern Madagascar (similar to 500 yr BP) to test
   this hypothesis. The Ankilitelo primates were compared with museum
   specimens of known locality. Extant taxa were assigned to one of five
   distinct ecogeographic regions, including spiny thicket, dry deciduous
   forest, succulent woodland, lowland and subhumid rainforest. Comparisons
   of tooth size in extant lemurs reveal significant geographical patterns
   of variation within genera. In general, the primates from Ankilitelo are
   indeed larger than their modern counterpart. However, these differences
   fit an ecoregional model of size variation, whereby Ankilitelo species
   are comparable in size to living forms inhabiting ecoregions present
   near the cave today. This suggests that Malagasy primates have been
   subjected to similar patterns of resource seasonality for at least 500
   years.},

Abstract = {According to recent field studies, the Fat-tailed Dwarf Lemur
   (Cheirogaleus medius) lives in permanent pairs together with the
   subadult offspring from the previous breeding season, within defended
   territories. Obligate paternal care was suggested to be responsible for
   the evolution of pair-living in this species. Aims of this study were to
   describe the population dynamics in C. medius and to draw attention to
   the occurrence of floating males as possible alternative to monogamy in
   these nocturnal lemurs.
   A mark-recapture study in the Kirindy Forest/CFPF western Madagascar,
   was combined with observations and radio-tracking of 34 individuals
   during the rainy seasons from 1995 to 1998. The study area was saturated
   with territories during the whole study period. Nevertheless,
   demographic variables such as population density, sex ratio, and age
   structure varied strongly between years. In 1996 and 1998 population
   density was highest (280 and 360 individuals/km(2)) and up to 21\% of
   the complete study population were subadults, while in 1995 and 1997
   only about 4\% of the captured animals were not adult and population
   density was relatively low Consistent with this hi-annual fluctuation,
   no infants were recorded in 1998. In two of the four study periods, the
   sex ratio of adults was male biased. These surplus males (= floaters)
   were not associated with a given female and differed significantly from
   males with pair-bonds (= territorial males) concerning movement patterns
   and sleeping habits. The large home ranges of these floaters overlapped
   mutually as well as with the territories of territorial pairs. Apart
   from testis size, that was significantly smaller in floaters during the
   mating season, morphometric data were not different between male of
   those two categories. Floaters were between two and at least four years
   old and sexually mature.
   Disappearance rate was not different between floaters and territorial
   males. The results suggest that floaters represent a pool of potential
   breeders, that may be prevented from pair-living by skewed sex ratios,
   high population densities and a subsequent lack of vacant territories.
   But since they have the chance to sneak copulations with females living
   in pairs, the possibility that floaters represent an alternative mating
   strategy in Cheirogaleus medius, cannot be ruled out. Future genetic
   studies about paternity and reproductive success of floaters and
   pair-bonded males, combined with demographic data, will show whether or
   not floaters represent an evolutionary stable strategy.},

Title = {Age-related decline in executive function as a hallmark of cognitive
   ageing in primates: an overview of cognitive and neurobiological studies},
Journal = {PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {375},
Number = {1811},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Executive function (EF) is a complex construct that reflects multiple
   higher-order cognitive processes such as planning, updating, inhibiting
   and set-shifting. Decline in these functions is a hallmark of cognitive
   ageing in humans, and age differences and changes in EF correlate with
   age-related differences and changes in association cortices,
   particularly the prefrontal areas. Here, we review evidence for
   age-related decline in EF and associated neurobiological changes in
   prosimians, New World and Old World monkeys, apes and humans. While EF
   declines with age in all primate species studied, the relationship of
   this decline with age-related alterations in the prefrontal cortex
   remains unclear, owing to the scarcity of neurobiological studies
   focusing on the ageing brain in most primate species. In addition, the
   influence of sex, vascular and metabolic risk, and hormonal status has
   rarely been considered. We outline several methodological limitations
   and challenges with the goal of producing a comprehensive integration of
   cognitive and neurobiological data across species and elucidating how
   ageing shapes neurocognitive trajectories in primates with different
   life histories, lifespans and brain architectures. Such comparative
   investigations are critical for fostering translational research and
   understanding healthy and pathological ageing in our own species.

   strepsirrhines are an intriguing and underutilized group in which to
   examine the links between these three factors and GMB composition. Here,
   we compare GMB composition in four species of captive, nocturnal
   strepsirrhines with varying feeding strategies and phylogenetic
   relationships, but nearly identical diets. We use 16S rRNA sequences to
   determine gut bacterial composition. Despite similar husbandry
   conditions, including diet, we find that GMB composition varies
   significantly across host species and is linked to host feeding strategy
   and phylogeny. The GMBs of the omnivorous and the frugivorous species
   were significantly more diverse than were those of the insectivorous and
   exudativorous species. Across all hosts, GMBs were enriched for
   bacterial taxa associated with the macronutrient resources linked to the
   host's respective feeding strategy. Ultimately, the reported variation
   in microbiome composition suggests that the impacts of captivity and
   concurrent diet do not overshadow patterns of feeding strategy and
   phylogeny. As our understanding of primate GMBs progresses, populations
   of captive primates can provide insight into the evolution of
   host-microbe relationships, as well as inform future captive management
   protocols that enhance primate health and conservation.},

Title = {Ectoparasites of endemic and domestic animals in southwest Madagascar},
Journal = {ACTA TROPICA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {196},
Pages = {83-92},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Human encroachment of natural habitats bears the threat of disease
   transmission between native and introduced species that had not come
   into contact before, thus promoting the spread of new diseases in both
   directions. This is a matter of concern especially in areas where
   human-wildlife contact has not been intense in the recent past. In
   southwest Madagascar, we collected ectoparasites from various mammalian
   hosts and chicken, and examined their host preferences and their
   prevalence in relation to season and habitat degradation.
   Field-work took place in the northern portion of Tsimanampetsotsa
   National Park and the adjacent coastal strip (littoral) in the dry and
   in the rainy season of 2016/2017. Endemic mammals were trapped with live
   traps placed in habitats of different degrees of degradation: 1)
   relatively pristine forest, 2) degraded forest, 3) cultivated and shrub
   land. Rats and mice were also trapped in 4) villages.
   We identified 17 species of ectoparasites (296 individuals of ticks {[}5
   species], 535 lice {[}7 app.], 389 fleas {[}4 spp.] and 13 mites {[}1
   sp.]) collected from 15 host species. There was no indication for
   seasonal or habitat effects on parasite infection. A large portion of
   the parasites was host-specific. Some ectoparasite species were shared
   either by several endemic or by several introduced species, but apart
   from the introduced flea species Echidnophaga gallinacea (collected from
   six different hosts including the endemic carnivore Galidictis
   grandidieri) no other ectoparasite species was shared between endemic
   and introduced host species.},

Abstract = {Sex-biased power structures are common in human and nonhuman primate
   societies. ``Female dominance{''} is a term applied to a wide range of
   female-biased power structures. However, the full extent of this
   variation remains obscure because an adequate vocabulary of power has
   not been adopted consistently. Female power occurs throughout primates
   and other animals, even in male-dominant societies, but the legacy of
   patriarchy persists in primatologists' use of language and implicit
   assumptions about intersexual power. While explanations for the
   occurrence of female power can be accommodated within existing
   ethological theory, many hypotheses seeking to explain the evolution of
   female power are narrowly focused on particular taxa. Theories about
   primate social evolution would benefit from a synthesis of the disparate
   literature on power, increased emphasis on intersexual social
   relationships, and comparative studies that include the full behavioral
   diversity of primates and other mammals.},

Title = {Genetic Analysis of the Indri Reveals No Evidence of Distinct Subspecies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {460-477},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Subspecies were traditionally defined by identifying gaps between
   phenotypes across the geographic range of a species, and may represent
   important units in the development of conservation strategies focused on
   preserving genetic diversity. Previous taxonomic research proposed that
   phenotypic variation between scattered Indri indri populations warranted
   the naming of two distinct subspecies, I. i. indri and I. i. variegatus.
   We tested these subspecific designations using mitochondrial sequence
   data generated from the control region or D-loop (569 bp) and a large
   section (2362 bp) of multiple genes and tRNAs known as Pastorini's
   fragment and nuclear microsatellite markers. This study used 114 samples
   of I. indri from 12 rainforest sites in eastern Madagascar, encompassing
   the entire range of the species. These genetic samples represent
   multiple populations from low- and high-elevation forests from both
   putative subspecies. Molecular analyses of the mitochondrial sequence
   data did not support the two proposed subspecies. Furthermore, the
   microsatellite analyses showed no significant differences across the
   range beyond population level differentiation. This study demonstrates
   the utility of incorporating multiple lines of evidence in addition to
   phenotypic traits to define species or subspecies.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated the relationship between the morphology of the
   sacrum-the sole bony link between the tail or coccyx and the rest of the
   body and tail length (including presence/absence) and function using a
   comparative sample of extant mammals spanning six orders (Primates,
   Carnivora, Rodentia, Diprotodontia, Pilosa, Scandentia; N = 472).
   Phylogenetically-informed regression methods were used to assess how
   tail length varied with respect to 11 external and internal (i.e.,
   trabecular) bony sacral variables with known or suspected biomechanical
   significance across all mammals, only primates, and only non-primates.
   Sacral variables were also evaluated for primates assigned to tail
   categories ('tailless,' `nonprehensile short-tailed,' `nonprehensile
   long-tailed,' and `prehensile-tailed'). Compared to primates with
   reduced tail lengths, primates with longer tails generally exhibited
   sacra having larger caudal neural openings than cranial neural openings,
   and last sacral vertebrae with more mediolaterally-expanded caudal
   articular surfaces than cranial articular surfaces, more
   laterally-expanded transverse processes, more dorsally-projecting
   spinous processes, and larger caudal articular surface areas.
   Observations were corroborated by the comparative sample, which showed
   that shorter-tailed (e.g., Lynx rufus {[}bobcat]) and longer-tailed
   (e.g., Acinonyx jubatus {[}cheetah]) non-primate mammals morphologically
   converge with shorter-tailed (e.g., Macaca nemestrina) and longer-tailed
   (e.g., Macaca fascicularis) primates, respectively. `Prehensile-tailed'
   primates exhibited last sacral vertebrae with more laterally expanded
   transverse processes and greater caudal articular surface areas than
   `nonprehensile long-tailed' primates. Internal sacral variables
   performed poorly compared to external sacral variables in analyses of
   extant primates, and were thus deemed less useful for making inferences
   concerning tail length and function in extinct primates. The tails
   lengths of five extinct primates were reconstructed from the external
   sacral variables: Archaeolemur edwardsi had a `nonprehensile long tail,'
   Megaladapis grandidieri, Palaeopropithecus kelyus, and Epipliopithecus
   vindobonensis probably had `nonprehensile short tails,' and Proconsul
   heseloni was `tailless.' (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Maintaining microendemic primate species along an environmental gradient

Abstract = {Understanding the drivers of species adaptations to changing
   environments on the one hand and the limits for hybridization on the
   other hand is among the hottest questions in evolutionary biology.
   Parasites represent one of the major selective forces driving host
   evolution and at least those with free-living stages are at the same
   time dependent on the ecological conditions of their host's habitat.
   Local immunological adaptations of host species to varying parasite
   pressure are therefore expected and might represent the genetic basis
   for ecological speciation and the maintenance of recently diverged
   species. Madagascar provides one of the rare examples where two
   partially sympatric primate species (Microcebus griseorufus, M.murinus)
   and their hybrids, as well as an allopatric species (M.cf rufus) live in
   close proximity along a very steep environmental gradient ranging from
   southern dry spiny bush to gallery forest to evergreen eastern humid
   rain forest, thus mimicking the situation encountered during extensions
   and retreats of vegetation formations under changing climatic
   conditions. This system was used to study parasite infection and immune
   gene (MHC) adaptations to varying parasite pressure that might provide
   selective advantages to pure species over hybrids. Parasite burdens
   increased with increasing humidity. M.griseorufus, M.murinus, and their
   hybrids but not M.rufus shared the same MHC alleles, indicating either
   retention of ancestral polymorphism or recent gene flow. The hybrids had
   much higher prevalence of intestinal parasites than either of the parent
   species living under identical environmental conditions. The different
   representation of parasites can indicate a handicap for hybrids that
   maintains species identities.},

Abstract = {Astrotrichilia asterotricha is an endemic large-seeded tree in
   Madagascar, which depends on large-bodied frugivorous primates for seed
   dispersal. Because such primates are threatened by habitat destruction
   and hunting, seed dispersal and regeneration of A. asterotricha are
   vulnerable to human activities due to the loss of seed dispersers. We
   developed 19 microsatellite markers using next-generation sequencing
   technology. The number of alleles ranged from two to nine, and the
   ranges of observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.158-0.950 and
   0.261-0.851, respectively. The cumulative probability of identity for
   all loci (excluding Ast01) was very low (8.6 x 10(-11)), indicating that
   these markers can be used for individual discrimination. They will be
   useful for examining gene flow via seed dispersal by animals, as well as
   the regeneration dynamics of A. asterotricha, in Malagasy forests.},

Title = {Seeing the Wood through the Trees: The Current State of Higher
   Systematics in the Strepsirhini},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {84},
Number = {3-5},
Pages = {201-219},
Abstract = {Strepsirhines comprise 10 living or recently extinct families,>= 50\% of
   extant primate families. Their phylogenetic relationships have been
   intensively studied, but common topologies have only recently emerged;
   e.g. all recent reconstructions link the Lepile-muridae and
   Cheirogaleidae. The position of the indriids, however, remains
   uncertain, and molecular studies have placed them as the sister to every
   clade except Daubentonia, the preferred sister group of morphologists.
   The node subtending Afro-Asian lorisids has been similarly elusive. We
   probed these phylogenetic inconsistencies using a test data set
   including 20 strepsirhine taxa and 2 outgroups represented by 3,543
   mtDNA base pairs, and 43 selected morphological characters, subjecting
   the data to maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference
   analyses, and reconstructing topology and node ages jointly from the
   molecular data using relaxed molecular clock analyses. Our permutations
   yielded compatible but not identical evolutionary histories, and
   currently popular techniques seem unable to deal adequately with
   morphological data. We investigated the influence of morphological
   characters on tree topologies, and examined the effect of taxon sampling
   in two experiments: (1) we removed the molecular data only for 5
   endangered Malagasy taxa to simulate `extinction leaving a fossil
   record'; (2) we removed both the sequence and morphological data for
   these taxa. Topologies were affected more by the inclusion of
   morphological data only, indicating that palaeontological studies that
   involve inserting a partial morphological data set into a combined data
   matrix of extant species should be interpreted with caution. The gap of
   approximately 10 million years between the daubentoniid divergence and
   those of the other Malagasy families deserves more study. The apparently
   contemporaneous divergence of African and non-daubentoniid Malagasy
   families 40-30 million years ago may be related to regional
   plume-induced uplift followed by a global period of cooling and drying.

Abstract = {Since the first chromosome painting study between human and

   Twenty-six to 43 homologous chromosome segments have been revealed in
   different species with human chromosome-specific paint probes. Various
   landmark rearrangements characteristic for each different lineage have
   been identified, as cytogenetic signatures that potentially unite

Journal = {ILAR JOURNAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {78-88},
Abstract = {Nonhuman primate (NHP) aging research has traditionally relied mainly on
   the rhesus macaque. But the long lifespan, low reproductive rate, and
   relatively large body size of macaques and related Old World monkeys
   make them less than ideal models for aging research. Manifold advantages
   would attend the use of smaller, more rapidly developing, shorter-lived
   NHP species in aging studies, not the least of which are lower cost and
   the ability to do shorter research projects. Arbitrarily defining
   ``small{''} primates as those weighing less than 500 g, we assess small,
   relatively short-lived species among the prosimians and callitrichids
   for suitability as models for human aging research. Using the criteria
   of availability, knowledge about (and ease of) maintenance, the
   possibility of genetic manipulation (a hallmark of 21(st) century
   biology), and similarities to humans in the physiology of age-related
   changes, we suggest three species-two prosimians (Microcebus murinus and
   Galago senegalensis) and one New World monkey (Callithrix jacchus)-that
   deserve scrutiny for development as major NHP models for aging studies.
   We discuss one other New World monkey group, Cebus spp., that might also
   be an effective NHP model of aging as these species are longer-lived for
   their body size than any primate except humans.},

Title = {Evidence for drought and forest declines during the recent megafaunal
   extinctions in Madagascar},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {506-519},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Aim There remains some uncertainty concerning the causes of extinctions
   of Madagascar's megafauna. One hypothesis is that they were caused by
   over-hunting by humans. A second hypothesis is that their extinction was
   caused by both environmental change and hunting. This paper
   systematically addresses the second hypothesis through examination of
   two new pollen records from southeastern Madagascar alongside other
   published records across the island.
   Location South-eastern Madagascar.
   Methods We reconstructed past vegetation and fire dynamics over the past
   6000 years at two sites in south-eastern Madagascar (Ste-Luce) using
   fossil pollen and charcoal contained in sedimentary sequences. We
   investigated drivers of vegetation changes and how these, in turn,
   influenced faunal species in the southeast, using published climatic,
   archaeological and faunal records. Further, we also used published
   records to provide a synthesis of environmental changes on the whole
   island.
   Results Vegetation reconstructions indicate that the mosaic vegetation
   in the region of Ste-Luce was highly dynamic in response to climatic
   changes. The open woodland, surrounding the littoral forest, transformed
   into an ericoid grassland between c. 5800 and 5200 cal. yr bp, possibly
   in response to a moderate drought recorded during this period. The
   littoral forest was more stable between c. 5100 and 1000 cal. yr bp,
   with only some minor compositional changes c. 2800 cal. yr bp and
   between c. 1900 and 1000 cal. yr bp. Significant forest decline,
   however, is observed at c. 950 cal. yr bp, coinciding with a drought and
   a marine surge. A comparison of these results with a synthesis of
   published vegetation records across the island shows asynchronous
   vegetation changes in response to various droughts during the Holocene,
   except for the 950 cal. yr bp drought event, with evidence of widespread
   vegetation transformations and fires across the island.
   Main conclusions Pronounced climatic desiccation between 1200 and 700
   cal. yr bp may have been the slow driver framing and triggering
   vegetation transformations and decline in megafaunal populations. In
   addition, hunting by drought-impacted human inhabitants and competition
   with newly introduced cattle would have amplified the impacts on
   megafaunal populations, leading to numerous extinctions in this period.},

Abstract = {In this study, we use deterministic and stochastic models to analyze the
   demography of Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) in a
   fluctuating rainfall environment. The model is based on 16 years of data
   from Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, southwest Madagascar. The parameters
   in the stage-classified life cycle were estimated using mark-recapture
   methods. Statistical models were evaluated using information-theoretic
   techniques and multi-model inference. The highest ranking model is
   time-invariant, but the averaged model includes rainfall-dependence of
   survival and breeding. We used a time-series model of rainfall to
   construct a stochastic demographic model. The time-invariant model and
   the stochastic model give a population growth rate of about 0.98.
   Bootstrap confidence intervals on the growth rates, both deterministic
   and stochastic, include 1. Growth rates are most elastic to changes in
   adult survival. Many demographic statistics show a nonlinear response to
   annual rainfall but are depressed when annual rainfall is low, or the
   variance in annual rainfall is high. Perturbation analyses from both the
   time-invariant and stochastic models indicate that recruitment and
   survival of older females are key determinants of population growth
   rate.},

Title = {Peacemaking on treetops: first evidence of reconciliation from a wild

Abstract = {Reconciliation is defined as the first postconflict affinitive contact
   between former opponents. While reconciliation in anthropoid primates
   has been widely investigated, few studies have focused on postconflict
   mechanisms in prosimians, and only in captivity. Unlike anthropoids,
   Malagasy prosimians show female dominance, lack of sexual dimorphism and
   seasonal breeding. However, they share features with anthropoids such as
   cohesive societies, female philopatry and individual recognition.
   Comparing social prosimians with anthropoids is crucial for
   understanding the evolution of reconciliation dynamics. Here we present
   the first study on reconciliation in a wild prosimian. We focused on the
   Propithecus verreauxi (sifaka) of the Berenty forest (southern
   Madagascar). We examined postconflict behaviour in the light of
   theoretical expectations based on potential costs and benefits of the
   individuals involved. Our results indicate that P. verreauxi can
   evaluate possible risks and benefits of engaging in postconflict
   reunions. Victims were most likely to interact affinitively with the
   aggressor after low-intensity aggression. Moreover, only the conflicts
   occurring outside the feeding context were reconciled. Such results are
   consonant with the fact that, in P. verreauxi, social dominance is
   translated more into feeding priority than into a framework of despotic
   relationships. In agreement with the valuable relationship hypothesis,
   P. verreauxi were more likely to reconcile with valuable partners:
   reconciliation preferentially occurred between subordinates and top-
   ranking individuals, and between animals sharing good relationships
   (high levels of affinitive behaviours). Over the short term,
   reconciliation in P. verreauxi seems to have an important role in
   reducing the probability of further attacks by the aggressor. (C) 2008

Title = {Sexual dimorphism in the pelvis of Microcebus},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1109-1122},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Pelvic sexual dimorphism occurs in many anthropoid species and is often
   attributed to obstetric selection on female pelvic morphology. Few
   studies of pelvic dimorphism have included strepsirrhine taxa, which
   typically have relatively smaller infants than those of anthropoids.
   Because smaller female primates give birth to relatively larger infants,
   it is possible that the pelves of Microcebus, the smallest extant
   primate genus, will show some evidence of selection on obstetric
   adequacy. A comparison of adult female and neonatal body masses
   indicates that individual neonatal Microcebus are relatively large
   compared to adult female body mass, even though members of the taxon
   frequently produce twins. I examined variation in the bony pelvis within
   a sample of Microcebus. I measured specimens from a single locality,
   which probably represent 1 population. I measured 8 pelvic and 3 femoral
   variables to investigate skeletal size and pelvic size and shape
   dimorphism. Females significantly exceed males in absolute values of
   sacral width, pelvic height, pubic length, and distances from the pubic
   symphysis to the ischial tuberosity and points on the sacrum.
   Measurements of the femur are not significantly greater in females,
   suggesting that the pelvic differences are not due to skeletal size
   dimorphism. Significant pelvic shape or ratio differences, calculated
   via the geometric mean of 5 variables as the denominator, included
   greater relative pubic length and sacral width in females. Hence
   selection for obstetric adequacy may occur in the extremely small-bodied
   Microcebus.},

Abstract = {Various hypotheses to explain possible functions of scent-marking have
   been put forth and basically fall into five categories: territorial
   demarcation, ownership of resources, mate attraction, noncombative
   fighting, and self-advertisement. Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus
   verreauxi verreauxi), like many prosimians, use scent-marking as one
   form of communication. The goal of this study was to determine the
   function of scent-marking in sifaka. All-occurrence of scent-marks,
   scent-mark context, and scent-mark style were collected on 23 sifaka. in
   the Kirindy Forest of western Madagascar for 7 months (September
   2001-March 2002). Scent-mark rates were collected using continuous focal
   animal sampling from November 2000-March 2002. Home range data were
   collected using monthly censuses and instantaneous focal sampling
   throughout the 17 months. Scent-marking behavior was exhibited almost
   exclusively by adults. Scent-mark rates were not related to the number
   of resident adult males, number of resident adult females, rank, or
   group size. The majority of scent-marks occurred in the perimeter of the
   home range; however, less than a quarter of the home range was used by
   only a single group. Sifaka did not preferentially mark food trees, mark
   during the mating season, or mark during intergroup encounters. The
   results from this study indicate that none of the five hypothesized
   functions best explains all scent-marking in Verreaux's sifaka. Rather,
   scent-marking may serve different functions for different individuals.},

Abstract = {Lying some 400 km off the coast of southeastern Africa, Madagascar is
   the world's largest oceanic island. It has been in roughly the same
   position relative to its parent continent for 120 million years, and as
   a consequence its mammal fauna is unusual in composition, with a low
   number of major taxa but a high diversity at lower taxonomic levels.
   Among Madagascar's native terrestrial mammals, only the orders Primates,
   Rodentia, Carnivora and Insectivora are represented (plus, until
   recently, the enigmatic and endemic Bibymalagasia, and Artiodactyla in
   the form of semiaquatic pygmy hippopotamuses). This reflects the fact
   that terrestrial mammals are notoriously poor overwater dispersers; yet
   at the same time the ancestors of all of Madagascar's mammals had to
   have crossed a wide oceanic barrier to get to the island at various
   points during the Tertiary. Here I examine the palaeogeographic evidence
   for potential land bridge or `stepping-stone' connections with adjacent
   continents from the Mesozoic through the Cenozoic, and review the fossil
   records and phylogenies of each of Madagascar's mammalian groups in an
   attempt to estimate the minimum number of crossings necessary to produce
   the island's current faunal composition. Probable monophyletic origins
   for each major group, and thus a smaller rather than a larger number of
   crossings of the Mozambique Channel, imply that this water barrier has
   acted as a powerful filter; so powerful that it is unclear whether any
   crossings would have been possible without some form of subaerial
   connection, however ephemeral, at least from time to time during the
   Tertiary. Clarification of how Madagascar's terrestrial mammal fauna may
   have originated is thus as likely to emerge from the geology of the
   seafloor surrounding the island as it is to come from the fossil record
   or from the internal and external relationships of its various
   components. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {The biodiversity of Madagascar is extraordinarily distinctive, diverse,
   and endangered. It is therefore urgent that steps be taken to document,
   describe, interpret, and protect this exceptional biota. As a
   collaborative group of field and laboratory biologists, we employ a
   suite of methodological and analytical tools to investigate the
   vertebrate portion of Madagascar's fauna. Given that species are the
   fundamental unit of evolution, where micro-and macroevolutionary forces
   converge to generate biological diversity, a thorough understanding of
   species distribution and abundance is critical for understanding the
   evolutionary, ecological, and biogeographic forces that have shaped
   Malagasy vertebrate diversity. We illustrate the means by which we apply
   Mayr's ``three basic tasks{''} of the systematist {[}Mayr, E. (1942)
   Systematics and the Origin of Species from the Viewpoint of a Zoologist
   (Harvard Univ. Press, Cambridge, MA)] to identify, classify, and study
   the organisms that together constitute Madagascar's vertebrate
   community. Using field inventory methods, specimen-based studies, and
   morphological and molecular analyses, we formulate hypotheses of species
   identity that then serve as the foundation for subsequent studies of
   biology and history. Our experience, as well as that of other
   investigators, has shown that much of the vertebrate species diversity
   in Madagascar is ``cryptic{''} for both biological and practical
   reasons. Beyond issues of cryptic biological diversity, the resolution
   of species identity in Madagascar has been hampered because of a lack of
   vouchered comparative material at the population level. Through our
   activities, we are attempting to remedy these limitations while
   simultaneously enhancing research capacity in Madagascar.},

Abstract = {A 16-year study of wild. unprovisioned sifaka Propithecus verreauxi
   verreauxi at Beza Mahafaly in southwest Madagascar pro, ides estimates
   of age-specific fertility, mortality, and dispersal in a population of
   426 marked animals. and longitudinal records of individual life
   histories. Sifaka females give birth for the first time later and live
   longer, for their size, than mammals in other orders; they also give
   birth later and continue reproducing longer, for their size, than other
   primates. Theory postulates that these features, commonly referred to as
   bet-hedging, evolve in unpredictable environments in association with
   widely varying infant survival and a trade-off between reproductive
   effort and adult survival. The climate of south-west Madagascar is
   highly unpredictable compared to almost all other regions in the tropics
   with similar average rainfall, and we argue that sifaka females are
   bet-hedgers par excellence. Male sifaka, in contrast, become
   reproductively active at an earlier age than females, and are less
   likely to have long lives than females. The atypical direction of this
   asymmetry between males and females reflects a `slowing down' of female
   life histories rather than a `speeding up' of male life histories. Two
   other unusual features of sifaka biology and behaviour may be linked to
   the unpredictability of Madagascar's climate: intense local competition
   between females, and a sex ratio at birth strongly biased in favour of
   males in most years. In drought years, reproductive females must cope
   with suddenly intensified resource constraints. This, in turn, may
   strongly limit the number of `breeding slots' available over the
   long-term for females.},

Abstract = {A cytogenetic study has been performed on Hapalemur griseus caught in
   different locations of the eastern and northern forests of Madagascar.
   This allowed the determination of the more precise distribution areas of
   the different subspecies and the isolation of a new cytogenetic
   polymorphic subspecies of H. griseus. The chromosomal changes
   distinguishing the different subspecies are Robertsonian translocations
   and gain of heterochromatin. The phylogeny established on chromosome
   comparison is compatible with the geographic distribution of the
   subspecies.},

Abstract = {Cytogenetic investigations performed on 30 specimens of Lepilemur
   septentrionalis confirmed the existence of 4 karyotypes differing from
   each other by 1-2 chromosomal rearrangements. These data, pooled with
   those obtained in earlier studies, showed that out of 60 animals
   karyotyped only two kinds of hybrids were detected, allowing us to
   characterise two chromosomally polymorphic populations. No natural
   hybrids could be found between these two populations, which could thus
   be considered as two separate species. The possible role of the
   chromosomal rearrangements in the process of reproductive isolation
   between these two populations is discussed. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger

Abstract = {The karyotypes of Eulemur species exhibit a high degree of variation, as
   a consequence of the Robertsonian fusion and/or centromere fission.
   Centromeric and pericentromeric heterochromatin of eulemurs is
   constituted by highly repeated DNA sequences (including some telomeric
   TTAGGG repeats) which have so far been investigated and used for the
   study of the systematic relationships of the different species of the
   genus Eulemur. In our study, we have cloned a set of repetitive
   pericentromeric sequences of five Eulemur species: E. fulvus fulvus
   (EFU), E. mongoz (EMO), E. macaco (EMA), E. rubriventer (ERU), and E.
   coronatus (ECO). We have characterized these clones by sequence
   comparison and by comparative fluorescence in situ hybridization
   analysis in EMA and EFU. Our results showed a high degree of sequence
   similarity among Eulemur species, indicating a strong conservation,
   within the five species, of these pericentromeric highly repeated DNA
   sequences. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this study, we compare the life-history patterns of male and female
   Eulemur fulvus rufus based on longitudinal data collected on individuals
   from two study groups from 1988-1998 in southeastern Madagascar Mean
   group size was 9.5 individuals, and groups either contained more adult
   males than females or equal numbers of both sexes. Females reproduced
   for the first time between 2 and 4 years of age and reproduced each
   gear, although the mean interbirth interval between surviving offspring
   was 2.1 years. An average of two adult females reproduced annually in
   each social group, and age and body weight may positively influence
   reproductive success. Females also appear ts be philopatric but Plot
   female-bonded. Young natal males immigrated between 3 and 4.5 years of
   age and may join a new group within 6-12 months based on the age of
   emigrants. Once in a social group, they remained until old age, although
   a male's spatial position in the social group varied with age. Young
   nonnatal males were members of the social core and had the first
   opportunity to mate with all estrous females. Older males were
   peripheral to the social group and mated with females later in their
   cycle. We hypothesize that group size, the number of females in the
   group, and individual variation in reproductive success is influenced by
   several ecological conditions at this site: extreme variability in food
   availability during reproductive periods, the lack of large food
   patches, low plant species diversity and small numbers of important
   aseasonal food sources such as Ficus species, (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {A reproductive study was conducted on seven hybrids of Eulemur showing

   presented a reduced spermatogenesis. In three out of these four hybrids,
   multivalents were associated with the sex bivalent in a large number of
   spermatocytes (23\%). The relative importance of the reduction of
   fertility in males linked to chromosomal multivalent formation as well
   as the genetic background is discussed with regard to the use of
   cytogenetic data for systematics, Our findings argue for the
   classification of Eulemur fulvus collaris and E. f. albocollaris in two
   separate species. In regard to their repartition area, their separation
   along a linear north-south axis in Madagascar is discussed. (C) 1997

   for phylogeny reconstruction, and the relationship of living lineages to

Abstract = {From 1984 to 1991, 126 males and females were marked and monitored in a
   wild population of Propithecus verreauxi in southwest Madagascar.
   Animals were assigned birth years, based on known birth date or degree
   of dental wear calibrated by recapture data. Twenty-one of 27 groups
   identified in 1984 persisted within stable home range boundaries, 6
   groups disappeared, and 6 new groups formed. Only males transferred
   between existing groups, although individuals of both sexes left groups
   to form new groups. The home range of the group into which a male
   transferred usually overlapped that of his group of origin. On average,
   35\% of males aged 3-6 years transferred each year. Older males
   transferred at a lower rate. Three to 6-year-old males were more likely
   than older males to transfer two or three times. Most 3-6-year old males
   transferred into groups with a higher proportion and number of females,
   whereas older males were progressively more likely to transfer into
   groups with a lower proportion and number of females. New groups were
   formed by older males, whose mates had died or who had not been
   successful in joining an existing group, and by young, nulliparous
   females. Males have rarely been observed for more than 5 years in the
   same group. Dispersal by 3-6-year-old males appeared to be voluntary.
   Females helped evict non-natal males from the group but did not prevent
   new males from joining. Age at first reproduction was 5 years in this
   population. Forced secondary dispersal may occur when maturing females
   cease to tolerate males who may be their fathers.},

Title = {Sex bias in intergroup conflict and collective movements among social

Abstract = {Intergroup conflict is a major evolutionary force shaping animal and
   human societies. Males and females should, on average, experience
   different costs and benefits for participating in collective action.
   Specifically, among mammals, male fitness is generally limited by access
   to mates whereas females are limited by access to food and safety. Here
   we analyse sex biases among 72 species of group-living mammals in two
   contexts: intergroup conflict and collective movements. Our comparative
   phylogenetic analyses show that the modal mammalian pattern is
   male-biased participation in intergroup conflict and female-biased
   leadership in collective movements. However, the probability of
   male-biased participation in intergroup conflicts decreased and
   female-biased participation increased with female-biased leadership in
   movements. Thus, female-biased participation in intergroup conflict only
   emerged in species with female-biased leadership in collective
   movements, such as in spotted hyenas and some lemurs. Sex differences
   are probably attributable to costs and benefits of participating in
   collective movements (e.g. towards food, water, safety) and intergroup
   conflict (e.g. access to mates or resources, risk of injury). Our
   comparative review offers new insights into the factors shaping sex bias
   in leadership across social mammals and is consistent with the `male
   warrior hypothesis' which posits evolved sex differences in human
   intergroup psychology.This article is part of the theme issue
   `Intergroup conflict across taxa'.},

Title = {An evolutionary gap in primate default mode network organization},
Journal = {CELL REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {39},

Month = {APR 12},
Abstract = {The human default mode network (DMN) is engaged at rest and in cognitive
   states such as self-directed thoughts. Interconnected homologous
   cortical areas in primates constitute a network considered as the
   equivalent. Here, based on a cross-species comparison of the DMN between
   humans and non-hominoid primates (macaques, marmosets, and mouse
   lemurs), we report major dissimilarities in connectivity profiles. Most
   importantly, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of non-hominoid
   primates is poorly engaged with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC),
   though strong correlated activity between the human PCC and the mPFC is
   a key feature of the human DMN. Instead, a fronto-temporal resting-state
   network involving the mPFC was detected consistently across non-hominoid
   primate species. These common functional features shared between
   non-hominoid primates but not with humans suggest a substantial gap in
   the organization of the primate's DMN and its associated cognitive
   functions.},

Title = {Comparative Analysis of the Vocal Repertoires of the Indri (Indri indri)

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Abstract = {Strepsirrhine vocalisations are extraordinarily diverse and
   cross-species comparisons are needed to explore how this variability
   evolved. We contributed to the investigation of primate acoustic
   diversity by comparing the vocal repertoire of two sympatric lemur
   species, Propithecus diadema and Indri indri. These diurnal species
   belong to the same taxonomic family and have similar activity patterns
   but different social structures. These features make them excellent
   candidates for an investigation of the phylogenetic, environmental, and
   social influence on primate vocal behavior. We recorded 3 P. diadema
   groups in 2014 and 2016. From 1,872 recordings we selected and assigned
   3814 calls to 9 a priori call types, on the basis of their acoustic
   structure. We implemented a reproducible technique performing an
   acoustic feature extraction relying on frequency bins, t-SNE data
   reduction, and a hard-clustering analysis. We first quantified the vocal
   repertoire of P. diadema, finding consistent results for the 9
   putatively identified call types. When comparing this repertoire with a
   previously published repertoire of I. indri, we found highly
   species-specific repertoires, with only 2\% of the calls misclassified
   by species identity. The loud calls of the two species were very
   distinct, while the low-frequency calls were more similar. Our results
   pinpoint the role of phylogenetic history, social and environmental
   features on the evolution of communicative systems and contribute to a
   deeper understanding of the evolutionary roots of primate vocal
   differentiation. We conclude by arguing that standardized and
   reproducible techniques, like the one we employed, allow robust
   comparisons and should be prioritized in the future.},

Title = {Megafrugivores as fading shadows of the past: extant frugivores and the
   abiotic environment as the most important determinants of the
   distribution of palms in Madagascar},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The extinction of all Madagascar's megafrugivores ca 1000 years ago, may
   have left its signature on the current distribution of
   vertebrate-dispersed plants across the island, due to the loss of
   effective seed dispersal. In this study, we dissect the roles of extinct
   and extant frugivore distributions, abiotic variables, human impact and
   spatial predictors on the compositional turnover, or beta-diversity, of
   palm (Arecaceae) species and their dispersal-related traits across 40
   assemblages in Madagascar. Variation partitioning showed that palm
   beta-diversity is mostly shaped by the distribution of extant frugivores
   (eight lemur, three bird, two rodent and one bat species) and the
   abiotic environment (e.g. forest cover, slope and temperature), and to a
   lesser extent by the distribution of extinct megafrugivores (several
   giant lemur and elephant bird species). However, the contribution of
   these variables differed between dry western assemblages and wet eastern
   assemblages, with a more prominent role, albeit still small, of extinct
   megafrugivores in the west. These results suggest that palm
   distributions in the dry west of Madagascar, where megafrugivores were
   probably most abundant in the past, still show signatures of past
   interactions. With a fourth-corner analysis we observed that the
   distribution of palm species with relatively large fruits and seeds was
   negatively associated with frugivore richness of both past and present
   communities and home range sizes of extant mammalian frugivores. This
   suggests that palm species with relatively large fruits tend to occur in
   places with fewer, small-ranged mammalian frugivores, which may indicate
   dysfunctional seed dispersal. Nevertheless, our results also indicate
   that several wide-ranging bird species with high dispersal ability
   (large hand-wing index) that also occasionally feed on fruits may
   compensate for this potential dispersal loss. Our study sheds new light
   on dispersal anachronisms in Madagascar, and how defaunation and past
   species interactions may underlie current plant distributions.},

Title = {Utilizing DeepSqueak for automatic detection and classification of
   mammalian vocalizations: a case study on primate vocalizations},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 27},
Abstract = {Bioacoustic analyses of animal vocalizations are predominantly
   accomplished through manual scanning, a highly subjective and
   time-consuming process. Thus, validated automated analyses are needed
   that are usable for a variety of animal species and easy to handle by
   non-programing specialists. This study tested and validated whether
   DeepSqueak, a user-friendly software, developed for rodent ultrasonic
   vocalizations, can be generalized to automate the
   detection/segmentation, clustering and classification of
   high-frequency/ultrasonic vocalizations of a primate species. Our
   validation procedure showed that the trained detectors for vocalizations
   of the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) can deal with different
   call types, individual variation and different recording quality.
   Implementing additional filters drastically reduced noise signals (4225
   events) and call fragments (637 events), resulting in 91\% correct
   detections (N-total = 3040). Additionally, the detectors could be used
   to detect the vocalizations of an evolutionary closely related species,
   the Goodman's mouse lemur (M. lehilahytsara). An integrated supervised
   classifier classified 93\% of the 2683 calls correctly to the respective
   call type, and the unsupervised clustering model grouped the calls into
   clusters matching the published human-made categories. This study shows
   that DeepSqueak can be successfully utilized to detect, cluster and
   classify high-frequency/ultrasonic vocalizations of other taxa than
   rodents, and suggests a validation procedure usable to evaluate further
   bioacoustics software.},

Abstract = {Investigating factors influencing infant physical and social development
   is important to elucidate primate adaptations and life history
   evolution. Infant sifakas exhibit a puzzling mismatch between dental
   precocity and relatively slow postnatal growth, but only anecdotal
   reports of infant development are available for a comparative appraisal
   of their early life history and maturation. We therefore collected
   behavioral data on mother-infant dyads of 16 infant Verreaux's sifakas
   (Propithecus verreauxi) from 3 birth cohorts in Kirindy Forest to assess
   how the infant's age, sex, mother's age, and environmental variation
   influence the infant's development until weaning. We found that somatic
   growth rates differed between the sexes, with females growing faster
   than males. Infants began ingesting solid food as early as 3 weeks of
   age, which is extremely early for a primate of this size and much
   earlier than in Lemuridae. Social behavior emerged at a later age than
   motor skills. Despite pronounced variation in the timing and occurrence
   of various infant activities, none of them differed between the sexes,
   except that male infants were more engaged in grooming others than
   females. Infant sifakas did not develop faster than other lemurs despite
   the extra available energy gained from ingesting solid food at an early
   age, but their mothers carry them for a relatively long period, perhaps
   because vertical clinging and leaping is a locomotor style that requires
   prolonged physical maturation. The adaptive significance of their dental
   precocity remains elusive, however. Thus, further studies are required
   to understand how developmental schedules have coevolved with ecological
   and anatomical factors.},

Abstract = {The morphological and ecological diversity of lemurs and lorisiformes
   once rivaled that of the rest of the primate order. Here, we assemble a
   dataset of 3D models representing the second mandibular molars of a wide
   range of extant and fossil strepsirrhines encompassing this diversity.
   We use these models to distill quantitative descriptors of tooth form
   and then analyze these data using new analytical methods. We employ a
   recently developed dental topography metric (ariaDNE), which is less
   sensitive to details of random error in 3D model quality than previously
   used metrics (e.g., DNE); Bayesian multinomial modeling with metrics
   designed to measure overfitting risk; and a tooth segmentation algorithm
   that allows the shapes of disaggregated tooth surface features to be
   quantified using dental topography metrics. This approach is successful
   at reclassifying extant strepsirrhine primates to known dietary ecology
   and indicates that the averaging of morphological information across the
   tooth surface does not interfere with the ability of dental topography
   metrics to predict dietary adaptation. When the most informative
   combination of dental topography metrics is applied to extinct species,
   many subfossil lemurs and the most basal fossil strepsirrhines are
   predicted to have been primarily frugivorous or gummivorous. This
   supports an ecological contraction among the extant lemurs and the
   importance of frugivory in the origins of crown Strepsirrhini,
   potentially to avoid competition with more insectivorous and folivorous
   members of Paleogene Afro-Arabian primate faunas.},

Title = {Simplified Communities of Seed-Dispersers Limit the Composition and Flow
   of Seeds in Edge Habitats},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Edge effects, driven by human modification of landscapes, can have
   critical impacts on ecological processes such as species interactions,
   with cascading impacts on biodiversity as a whole. Characterizing how
   edges affect vital biotic interactions such as seed dispersal by
   frugivores is important for better understanding potential mechanisms
   that drive species coexistence and diversity within a plant community.
   Here, we investigated how differences between frugivore communities at
   the forest edge and interior habitats of a diverse tropical rainforest
   relate to patterns of animal-mediated seed dispersal and early seedling
   recruitment. We found that the lemur communities across the forest
   edge-interior gradient in this system showed the highest species
   richness and variability in body sizes at intermediate distances; the
   community of birds showed the opposite pattern for species richness.
   Three large-bodied frugivores, known to be effective dispersers of large
   seeds, tended to avoid the forest edge. As result, the forest edges
   received a lower rate of animal-mediated seed dispersal compared to the
   interior habitats. In addition, we also found that the seeds that were
   actively dispersed by animals in forest edge habitats were smaller in
   size than seeds dispersed in the forest interior. This pattern was found
   despite a similarity in seed size of seasonally fruiting adult trees and
   shrubs between the two habitats. Despite these differences in dispersal
   patterns, we did not observe any differences in the rates of seedling
   recruitment or seed-size distribution of successful recruit species. Our
   results suggest that a small number of frugivores may act as a potential
   biotic filter, acting on seed size, for the arrival of certain plant
   species to edge habitats, but other factors may be more important for
   driving recruitment patterns, at least in the short term. Further
   research is needed to better understand the potential long-term impacts
   of altered dispersal regimes relative to other environmental factors on
   the successional dynamics of edge communities. Our findings are
   important for understanding potential ecological drivers of tree
   community changes in forest edges and have implications for conservation
   management and restoration of large-seeded tree species in disturbed
   habitats.},

Abstract = {Based on their relatively large, chisel-like incisors and robust
   dentaries, species of the Paleocene plesiadapid mammal Chiromyoides have
   been described as potential ecological analogues of either seedeating
   rodents or the unusually specialized lemur Daubentonia madagascariensis.
   Here, we analyze the most complete dentaries of Chiromyoides currently
   known in order to illuminate jaw form and function in this taxon.
   Principal Component Analysis shows that Chiromyoides campanicus and
   Daubentonia are uniquely similar in select dentary proportions when
   compared with a sample including seven other fossil plesiadapid taxa as
   well as 22 extant primates, dermopterans and scandentians. Comparative
   allometric analyses indicate that in both Daubentonia and Chiromyoides,
   the unique jaw proportions are likely achieved through hypertrophy of
   masseteric fossa length and dentary depth, rather than simple reduction
   of tooth row length. Consistent with these dentary features indicative
   of powerful gnawing, we show that incisor apex morphology became
   increasingly chisel-like in certain younger species of Chiromyoides.
   Importantly, slight reduction in molar area relative to jaw length and
   body mass appears to characterize all species of Chiromyoides in which
   molar proportions can be estimated. Notably, this pattern occurs in one
   of the oldest known specimens of Chiromyoides, an edentulous but
   relatively complete dentary from the middle Tiffanian of Texas, which
   differs from other Chiromyoides specimens in having a relatively
   shallower corpus. Taken together, this evidence suggests that
   Chiromyoides was a Daubentonia-like extractive forager that evolved from
   taxa whose diets emphasized exudates. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {Life history, brain size and energy expenditure scale with body mass in
   mammals but there is little conclusive evidence for a correlated
   evolution between life history and energy expenditure (either
   basal/resting or daily) independent of body mass. We addressed this
   question by examining the relationship between primate free-living daily
   energy expenditure (DEE) measured by doubly labeled water method (n=18
   species), life history variables (maximum lifespan, gestation and
   lactation duration, interbirth interval, litter mass, age at first
   reproduction), resting metabolic rate (RMR) and brain size. We also
   analyzed whether the hypometabolic primates of Madagascar (lemurs) make
   distinct energy allocation tradeoffs compared to other primates (monkeys
   and apes) with different life history traits and ecological constraints.
   None of the life-history traits correlated with DEE after controlling
   for body mass and phylogeny. In contrast, a regression model showed that
   DEE increased with increasing RMR and decreasing reproductive output
   (i.e., litter mass/interbirth interval) independent of body mass.
   Despite their low RMR and smaller brains, lemurs had an average DEE
   remarkably similar to that of haplorhines. The data suggest that lemurs
   have evolved energy strategies that maximize energy investment to
   survive in the unusually harsh and unpredictable environments of
   Madagascar at the expense of reproduction.},

Title = {Motion cues increase focused attention towards purely visual stimuli in
   a nocturnal primate and drive stimulus interaction and

Abstract = {Visual information is of pivotal ecological importance to monkeys, apes,
   and humans, whereas its role in nocturnal primate ecology is less well
   understood. We explored how purely visual information modulates the
   behavior of a nocturnal primate. Abstract (shape), photographic (shape +
   detail), or video (shape + detail + motion) representations of arthropod
   prey (Zophobas morio; food context) or a male conspecific (social
   context) were systematically presented to 22 individuals of the gray
   mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) using a touchscreen. We assessed
   stimulus-directed touch interactions, durations of focused visual
   attention towards the different stimuli, and durations spent in the half
   of the setup-chamber more distant to the touchscreen (as quantification
   of approach/avoidance). Focused attention towards the stimulus generally
   increased from abstract and photographic to videographic stimuli. For
   the food context, indications for a parallel increase in
   stimulus-directed touch interactions from abstract stimulus to video
   were found. Approach/avoidance was independent of the stimulus type
   within both contexts. A comparison between the contexts under the video
   condition revealed higher durations of visual attention and lower
   stimulus avoidance in the food context compared to the social context.
   The number of touch interactions with the video stimulus was not
   generally context-dependent, but context-dependency related to sex: In
   the food context, animals with high and low numbers of touch
   interactions were equally distributed across sexes. In the social
   context, females showed the highest numbers of touch interactions.
   Numbers in males declined compared to the food context. Our results
   demonstrate for the first time that purely visual information modulates
   mouse lemur behavior and focused attention in a content- and
   context-specific manner, suggesting that vision is of high importance
   for the ecology of these nocturnal primates. The findings emphasize the
   need for further vision-based experiments to gain deeper insight into
   the evolution of visual information processing and cognition in
   nocturnal primates.},

   single-cell RNA sequencing analysis},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 12},
Abstract = {Conventional scRNA-seq expression analyses rely on the availability of a
   high quality genome annotation. Yet, as we show here with scRNA-seq
   experiments and analyses spanning human, mouse, chicken, mole rat, lemur
   and sea urchin, genome annotations are often incomplete, in particular
   for organisms that are not routinely studied. To overcome this hurdle,
   we created a scRNA-seq analysis routine that recovers biologically
   relevant transcriptional activity beyond the scope of the best available
   genome annotation by performing scRNA-seq analysis on any region in the
   genome for which transcriptional products are detected. Our tool
   generates a single-cell expression matrix for all transcriptionally
   active regions (TARs), performs single-cell TAR expression analysis to
   identify biologically significant TARs, and then annotates TARs using
   gene homology analysis. This procedure uses single-cell expression
   analyses as a filter to direct annotation efforts to biologically
   significant transcripts and thereby uncovers biology to which scRNA-seq
   would otherwise be in the dark. Conventional single-cell RNA sequencing
   analysis rely on genome annotations that may be incomplete or inaccurate
   especially for understudied organisms. Here the authors present a
   bioinformatic tool that leverages single-cell data to uncover
   biologically relevant transcripts beyond the best available genome
   annotation.},

Title = {Orientation Preference Maps in Microcebus murinus Reveal Size-Invariant

Abstract = {Orientation preference maps (OPMs) are a prominent feature of primary
   visual cortex (V1) organization in many primates and carnivores. In
   rodents, neurons are not organized in OPMs but are instead interspersed
   in a ``salt and pepper'' fashion, although clusters of
   orientation-selective neurons have been reported. Does this fundamental
   difference reflect the existence of a lower size limit for orientation
   columns (OCs) below which they cannot be scaled down with decreasing V1
   size? To address this question, we examined V1 of one of the smallest
   living primates, the 60-g prosimian mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus).
   Using chronic intrinsic signal imaging, we found that mouse lemur V1
   contains robust OCs, which are arranged in a pinwheel-like fashion. OC
   size in mouse lemurs was found to be only marginally smaller compared to
   themacaque, suggesting that these circuit elements are nearly
   incompressible. The spatial arrangement of pinwheels is well described
   by a common mathematical design of primate V1 circuit organization. In
   order to accommodate OPMs, we found that the mouse lemur V1 covers
   one-fifth of the cortical surface, which is one of the largest
   V1-to-cortex ratios found in primates. These results indicate that the
   primate-type visual cortical circuit organization is constrained by a
   size limitation and raises the possibility that its emergence might have
   evolved by disruptive innovation rather than gradual change.},

Title = {Conditioning learning in an attentional task relates to age and
   ventricular expansion in a nonhuman primate (Microcebus murinus)},
Journal = {BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {399},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {The grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is a promising nonhuman
   primate model for brain ageing and neurodegenerative diseases.
   Age-related cognitive decline in this model is well described, however,
   data on possible relations between attention and age, as they are known
   from humans, are missing.
   We tested 10 mouse lemurs in a touchscreen-based version of the
   5-choice-serial-reaction-time-task (5CSRTT) on visuo-spatial attention:
   subjects had to interact with a briefly presented stimulus occurring
   unpredictably in one out of five locations on the touchscreen. Animals
   were trained to an 80 \% performance at a four seconds stimulus
   presentation duration (SPD) and subsequently challenged by a SPD of two
   seconds. Additionally, ventricular expansion was assessed using
   structural magnetic resonance imaging.
   Trials to the 80 \% criterion at four seconds SPD correlated
   significantly with age and with ventricular expansion, especially around
   the occipital lobe. Once criterion performance was reached, two seconds
   challenge performance was independent of age. In four subjects that were
   additionally challenged with 1.5, 1.0, 0.8, or 0.6 s SPDs or variable
   delays preceding stimulus presentation, performance linearly declined
   with decreasing SPD, i. e. increasing attentional demand.
   In conclusion, this is the first report of 5CSRTT data in mouse lemurs
   and demonstrates the general applicability of this task of visuo-spatial
   attention to this nonhuman primate model. Results further demonstrate
   age related deficits in learning during acquisition of the 5CSRTT and
   suggest that both may be linked through age related atrophy of occipital
   structures and a resulting deficit in central visual processes.},

Abstract = {Elucidating signaling driven by lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) could
   help drug development. Here, we solve the crystal structure of LMTK3
   kinase domain to 2.1A resolution, determine its consensus motif and
   phosphoproteome, unveiling in vitro and in vivo LMTK3 substrates. Via
   high-throughput homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence screen coupled
   with biochemical, cellular, and biophysical assays, we identify a potent
   LMTK3 small-molecule inhibitor (C28). Functional and mechanistic studies
   reveal LMTK3 is a heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) client protein,
   requiring HSP90 for folding and stability, while C28 promotes
   proteasome-mediated degradation of LMTK3. Pharmacologic inhibition of
   LMTK3 decreases proliferation of cancer cell lines in the NCI-60 panel,
   with a concomitant increase in apoptosis in breast cancer cells,
   recapitulating effects of LMTK3 gene silencing. Furthermore, LMTK3
   inhibition reduces growth of xenograft and transgenic breast cancer
   mouse models without displaying systemic toxicity at effective doses.
   Our data reinforce LMTK3 as a druggable target for cancer therapy.},

Abstract = {The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is a valuable model in
   research on age-related proteopathies. This nonhuman primate, comparable
   to humans, naturally develops tau and amyloid-beta proteopathies during
   aging. Whether these are linked to cognitive alterations is unknown.
   Here, standardized cognitive testing in pairwise discrimination and
   reversal learning in a sample of 37 aged (>5 years) subjects was
   combined with tau and amyloid-beta histochemistry in individuals that
   died naturally. Correlation analyses in successfully tested subjects (n
   = 22) revealed a significant relation between object discrimination
   learning and age, strongly influenced by outliers, suggesting
   pathological cases. Where neuroimmunohistochemistry was possible, as
   subjects deceased, the naturally developed cortical amyloid-beta burden
   was significantly linked to pretraining success (intraneuronal
   accumulations) and discrimination learning (extracellular deposits),
   showing that cognitive (pairwise discrimination) performance in old age
   predicts the natural accumulation of amyloid-beta at death. This is the
   first description of a direct relation between the cortical amyloid-beta
   burden and cognition in a nonhuman primate. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Accurate tracking and analysis of animal behavior is crucial for modern
   systems neuroscience. However, following freely moving animals in
   naturalistic, three-dimensional (3D) or nocturnal environments remains a
   major challenge. Here, we present EthoLoop, a framework for studying the
   neuroethology of freely roaming animals. Combining real-time optical
   tracking and behavioral analysis with remote-controlled stimulus-reward
   boxes, this system allows direct interactions with animals in their
   habitat. EthoLoop continuously provides close-up views of the tracked
   individuals and thus allows high-resolution behavioral analysis using
   deep-learning methods. The behaviors detected on the fly can be
   automatically reinforced either by classical conditioning or by
   optogenetic stimulation via wirelessly controlled portable devices.
   Finally, by combining 3D tracking with wireless neurophysiology we
   demonstrate the existence of place-cell-like activity in the hippocampus
   of freely moving primates. Taken together, we show that the EthoLoop
   framework enables interactive, well-controlled and reproducible
   neuroethological studies in large-field naturalistic settings.
   EthoLoop enables real-time tracking and behavioral analysis of animals
   in naturalistic environments and can be combined with behavioral
   conditioning, optogenetic stimulation or wireless recording of neural
   activity. The system is illustrated with freely behaving mice and mouse
   lemurs.},

Title = {Neurobiological substrates of animal personality and cognition in a
   nonhuman primate (Microcebus murinus)},
Journal = {BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Introduction The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is an important
   nonhuman primate model in biomedical research. Numerous studies
   investigated mouse lemur behavior and possible factors underlying
   interindividual variation in both, animal personality and cognitive
   performance. Some effects, such as an age-related decline in executive
   functioning, have robustly been found across laboratory colonies;
   however, little is known about the brain structural substrates in mouse
   lemurs. Methods Here, we provide first exploratory data linking in vivo
   magnetic resonance imaging of 34 mouse lemurs to performance in a
   standardized, touchscreen-based task on object discrimination and
   reversal learning as well as to animal personality under different
   scenarios in an open field. Results High interindividual variability in
   both brain morphometric and behavioral measurements was found, but only
   few significant correlations between brain structure and behavior were
   revealed: Object discrimination learning was linked to the volume of the
   hippocampus and to temporal lobe thickness, while reversal learning was
   linked to thalamic volume and the thickness of the anterior cingulate
   lobe. Emergence latency into the open field correlated with volume of
   the amygdala. General exploration-avoidance in the empty open-field
   arena correlated with thicknesses of the anterior cingulate lobe and
   fronto-parietal substructures. Neophilia, assessed as exploration of a
   novel object placed in the arena, among others, related to the volume of
   the caudate nucleus. Conclusion In summary, our data suggest a prominent
   role of temporal structures (including the hippocampus) for learning
   capability, as well as thalamic and anterior cingulate structures for
   cognitive flexibility and response inhibition. The amygdala, the
   anterior cingulate lobe, and the caudate nucleus are particularly linked
   to animal personality in the open-field setting. These findings are
   congruent with the comparative psychological literature and provide a
   valuable basis for future studies elucidating aspects of behavioral
   variation in this nonhuman primate model.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {45},
Number = {7},
Pages = {581-592},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Solitary species often employ chemocommunication to facilitate mate
   localization. In the solitarily foraging, nocturnal mouse lemurs
   (Microcebus spp.), females advertise their short period of estrus
   acoustically and by increased scent marking, whereas males search widely
   for receptive females. Both sexes can be trained by operant conditioning
   to discriminate conspecific from heterospecific urine scent. However, it
   is not known, if males during and outside the reproductive season show
   different spontaneous interest in conspecific female urine, and if urine
   from estrous females elicits a higher investigation response than that
   from diestrous females. We established a spontaneous discrimination
   paradigm and quantified olfactory investigation responses of 21 captive
   male mouse lemurs of M. lehilahytsara and M. murinus when presenting 1
   conspecific and 1 heterospecific female urine odor sample
   simultaneously. Overall, M. murinus investigated stimuli significantly
   longer than M. lehilahytsara. Moreover, males of M. murinus showed
   significantly longer olfactory investigation at conspecific urine
   samples during but not outside the reproductive season. This indicates
   that female urinary cues are spontaneously discriminated by male M.
   murinus and that this discrimination is more relevant during the
   reproductive season. However, males of both species did not show
   different responses toward urine samples from estrous versus diestrous
   females. Finally, male age did not correlate with the overall duration
   of olfactory investigation, and investigation levels were similar when
   testing with fresh or frozen urine samples. In conclusion, this new
   spontaneous discrimination paradigm provides a useful additional tool to
   study olfactory communication of nocturnal primates from the receiver's
   perspective.},

Title = {Sex-Specific Response to Caloric Restriction After Reproductive
   Investment inMicrocebus murinus: An Integrative Approach},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {In seasonal environments, males and females usually maintain high
   metabolic activity during the whole summer season, exhausting their
   energy reserves. In the global warming context, unpredictability of food
   availability during summer could dramatically challenge the energy
   budget of individuals. Therefore, one can predict that resilience to
   environmental stress would be dramatically endangered during summer.
   Here, we hypothesized that females could have greater capacity to
   survive harsh conditions than males, considering the temporal shift in
   their respective reproductive energy investment, which can challenge
   them differently, as well as enhanced flexibility in females'
   physiological regulation. We tackled this question on the gray mouse
   lemur (Microcebus murinus), focusing on the late summer period, after
   the reproductive effort. We monitored six males and six females before
   and after a 2-weeks 60\% caloric restriction (CR), measuring different
   physiological and cellular parameters in an integrative and comparative
   multiscale approach. Before CR, females were heavier than males and
   mostly characterized by high levels of energy expenditure, a more
   energetic mitochondrial profile and a downregulation of blood
   antioxidants. We observed a similar energy balance between sexes due to
   CR, with a decrease in metabolic activity over time only in males.
   Oxidative damage to DNA was also reduced by different pathways between
   sexes, which may reflect variability in their physiological status and
   life-history traits at the end of summer. Finally, females' mitochondria
   seemed to exhibit greater flexibility and greater metabolic potential
   than males in response to CR. Our results showed strong differences
   between males and females in response to food shortage during late
   summer, underlining the necessity to consider sex as a factor for
   population dynamics in climate change models.},

   namely, the conversion of a wild animal into an experimental organism
   that lives, breeds, and survives in the laboratory. It argues that the
   ``old{''} mouse lemur model can be considered as aneco-zootechnical
   acquisition. This is shown by examining how, since the early 1970s,
   French mouse lemur researchers have articulated colony productivity and
   viability with the influence of environmental factors on the
   demographics and physiology of the species. The appearance and
   maintenance of a growing number of old mouse lemurs in French research
   facilities are related to three developments: the application of the
   ecological notion of ``social stress{''} to the understanding and
   management of the behavior of the captive population; the experimental
   demonstration that a variety of seasonal physiological changes in the
   species were influenced by the photoperiod; and the related attempt to
   accelerate aging in mouse lemurs through the manipulation of annual
   light conditions.},

Title = {Comparison of the Glucocorticoid Concentrations between Three Species
   ofLemuridaeKept in a Temporary Housing Facility},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Lemurs kept in captivity are constantly influenced by a
   number of factors that affect their welfare. All lemur species are
   classified as endangered species according to the International Union
   for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and their population in the
   wild is decreasing. It is therefore useful to improve the methods for
   assessing the level of stress in individual lemurs in captivity. In this
   study, we compared the changes in glucocorticoid concentrations in three
   species ofLemuridaein response to various types of potential stressors
   during their stay in a temporary housing facility. The glucocorticoid
   levels were specifically monitored for ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta),
   white-headed lemurs (Eulemur albifrons) and collared brown lemurs
   (Eulemur collaris). We compared the glucocorticoid concentrations in
   response to various types of potential stressors present during standard
   operation of a temporary housing facility between three species, namely,
   ring-tailed lemurs, collared brown lemurs and white-headed lemurs. The
   levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) were measured
   non-invasively on a daily basis during a 30-day period. A total of 510
   faecal samples were collected. Concentrations of immunoreactive
   glucocorticoid hormone metabolites were measured in the obtained
   extracts by using an enzyme immunoassay. The polyclonal antibodies used
   in this assay were directed against the metabolite
   11-oxo-etiocholanolone I. We found all three monitored lemur species to
   respond to specific potentially stressful situations by increasing (p<
   0.05) the FGM levels within one to two days after the event. Although
   housed in the same room, differences in response to potentially
   stressful situations were found in white-headed lemurs compared to
   ring-tailed lemurs. Increased mean levels of the FGMs were found more
   frequently in white-headed lemurs than in ring-tailed lemurs. The
   results suggest that this species may be more sensitive to changes in
   its surroundings. In general, the levels of the FGMs showed a similar
   pattern during 30 days of monitoring suggesting that all groups of
   lemurs responded in a similar manner to the same events. However, we
   recorded the differences in the absolute values of glucocorticoid
   concentrations between the monitored species likely due to the
   differences in sex ratios in the groups and presence of lactating
   females in the ring-tailed lemurs.},

Abstract = {Lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) is oncogenic in various cancers. In
   breast cancer, LMTK3 phosphorylates and modulates the activity of
   estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha) and is essential for the growth of
   ER-positive cells. LMTK3 is highly expressed in ER-negative breast
   cancer cells, where it promotes invasion via integrin beta 1. LMTK3
   abundance and/or high nuclear expression have been linked to shorter
   disease free and overall survival time in a variety of cancers,
   supporting LMTK3 as a potential target for anticancer drug development.
   We sought to identify small molecule inhibitors of LMTK3 with the
   ultimate goal to pharmacologically validate this kinase as a novel
   target in cancer. We used a homogeneous time resolve fluorescence (HTRF)
   assay to screen a collection of mixture-based combinatorial chemical
   libraries containing over 18 million compounds. We identified several
   cyclic guanidine-linked sulfonamides with sub-micromolar activity and
   evaluated their binding mode using a 3D homology model of the LMTK3 K-D.},

Title = {Temporal patterns of waterhole use as a predator avoidance strategy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {101},
Number = {2},
Pages = {574-581},

Abstract = {Animals that depend on water sources in dry environments must balance
   their water demands with predation risk. In settings of water scarcity,
   predators may strategically exploit prey's dependence on water; prey may
   adjust their use of water sources either spatially or temporally to
   avoid overlapping with predators. To examine the spatiotemporal dynamics
   of predators and prey at water sources, we studied the use of
   semipermanent waterholes in the dry season by red-fronted lemurs
   (Eulemur rufifrons), a primate species that exhibits flexible circadian
   activity patterns and inhabits a dry deciduous forest in western
   Madagascar. We hypothesized that lemurs avoid predators in their
   spatiotemporal use of waterholes. We analyzed the patterns of camera
   trap activations at waterholes by red-fronted lemurs and their two main
   predators: fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) and Madagascar harrier hawks
   (Polyboroides radiatus). We found that red-fronted lemurs were unlikely
   to use waterholes at times of day when predators were commonly present,
   and that the distributions of times of waterhole use differed between
   red-fronted lemurs and each of their predator species. Red-fronted
   lemurs frequently used waterholes that were also used by predators
   within the same week in part because the predators used a variable set
   of water resources. In this system, predators did not appear to exploit
   waterholes for the high density of red-fronted lemurs attracted to them,
   but instead likely used waterholes primarily to meet their own water
   demands. Our findings suggest that when predators and prey share water
   sources, prey may adjust their behavior to reduce their risk of overlap
   with predators, including through avoidance of indirect cues of
   predation, such as waterholes at particular times of day.},

Title = {Lactating Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) exhibit reduced
   stress responses in comparison to males and nonlactating females},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone that plays a principal role in
   metabolic function and stress responses in wild primates. Stressors are
   ubiquitous in environments and elicit a variety of physiological and
   behavioral responses. While stress responses are adaptive in the
   short-term, they can have negative effects when experienced over longer
   durations. As a physiological stressor, the process of lactation is an
   energetically expensive activity for mammals. Milk production increases
   water loss and increased hydration demands are amplified in mammalian
   species inhabiting xeric habitats, including lemur species living in
   northwestern Madagascar-the region for this research work. Here, sifakas
   give birth during the dry season (May-October) and wean infants during
   the subsequent wet season (November-April). The author collected fecal
   samples during the 24 weeks following infant births in 10 groups of
   Coquerel's sifaka in Ankarafantsika Park, Madagascar. The author
   analyzed the samples by comparing the first 12-week time block to the
   second 12-week time block, which corresponded to the dry and the
   beginning of the wet seasons, respectively. Analyses were based on 375
   samples collected over two birth seasons (2010 and 2011). A linear mixed
   model determined the relationships between reproductive class and
   temporal cortisol variation. The three reproductive classes had
   significantly different cortisol concentrations. Lactating females had
   lower cortisol than adult males and nonlactating females in all weeks
   postnatal. Males had significantly higher cortisol in weeks 13-24
   relative to weeks 1-12. Examining seasonal changes in cortisol
   concentrations demonstrates how lemurs respond physiologically to the
   energetic constraints of lactation during the critical life history
   stage of infant development.},

Abstract = {Climate change and habitat loss threaten species survival in Madagascar.
   Ruffed lemurs, a representative species in the eastern rainforest, could
   lose 38-93\% of their habitat from climate change and deforestation by
   2070; protecting areas from deforestation is necessary to protect
   Malagasy biodiversity.
   Madagascar has experienced extensive deforestation and overharvesting,
   and anthropogenic climate change will compound these pressures.
   Anticipating these threats to endangered species and their ecosystems
   requires considering both climate change and habitat loss effects. The
   genus Varecia (ruffed lemurs), which is composed of two Critically
   Endangered forest-obligate species, can serve as a status indicator of
   the biodiverse eastern rainforest of Madagascar. Here, we combined
   decades of research to show that the suitable habitat for ruffed lemurs
   could be reduced by 29-59\% from deforestation, 14-75\% from climate
   change (representative concentration pathway 8.5) or 38-93\% from both
   by 2070. If current protected areas avoid further deforestation, climate
   change will still reduce the suitable habitat by 62\% (range: 38-83\%).
   If ongoing deforestation continues, the suitable habitat will decline by
   81\% (range: 66-93\%). Maintaining and enhancing the integrity of

Title = {Assessment of the threatened carnivore community in the recently

Journal = {ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Madagascar is an island nation renowned for its biodiversity and species
   endemism, yet it is still largely understudied despite intense
   anthropogenic threats including forest loss and edge effects.
   Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve is a recently expanded rainforest
   protected area that is lacking detailed surveys and assessments of the
   native carnivore community of the endemic family Eupleridae. To identify
   which terrestrial carnivores occupy the reserve and what anthropogenic
   disturbances and factors best explain their occurrence patterns, we
   deployed 35 motion-activated cameras to detect native and introduced
   carnivores. From November 2018 to February 2019, we collected 2918
   unique capture events (all species) and confirmed the presence of 5
   eup-lerids: Galidia elegans, Galidictis fasciata, Eupleres goudotii,
   Fossa fossana, and Cryptoprocta ferox. These results extend the known
   range of E. goudotii and G. fasciata. In the reserve, F. fossana and G.
   elegans were the most common and widespread native carnivores, while E.
   goudotii was the rarest. We highlight the negative impact of edge
   effects on G. fasciata and F. fossana and the threat posed by the
   free-ranging non-native carnivore C. familiaris. This study represents
   the first detailed survey and occurrence estimates of the carnivore
   community of this protected area, allowing comparison with other
   protected areas in Madagascar. Our empirical findings show that
   anthropogenic disturbance negatively impacts carnivore existence within
   the Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve and provide important management
   recommendations for protecting the carnivore community and the
   co-occurring wildlife living within this area.},

Title = {First experimental evidence for olfactory species discrimination in two
   nocturnal primate species (Microcebus lehilahytsara and M. murinus)},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Olfactory communication is highly important for nocturnal mammals,
   especially for solitary foragers, but knowledge is still limited for
   nocturnal primates. Mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) are nocturnal
   solitary foragers with a dispersed lifestyle and frequently use
   chemo-sensory signalling behaviour for governing social interactions.
   Different mouse lemur species can co-occur in a given forest but it is
   unknown whether olfaction is involved in species recognition. We first
   screened 24 captive mouse lemurs (9 M. murinus, 15 M. lehilahytsara) for
   their olfactory learning potential in an experimental arena and then
   tested the species discrimination ability with urine odour in an operant
   conditioning paradigm in four individuals. The majority of the screened
   animals (75\%) did not pass the screening criteria within a 2-week test
   period. However, all four final test animals, two M. murinus and two M.
   lehilahytsara, were successfully trained in a 5-step-conditioning
   process to reliably discriminate conspecific from heterospecific urine
   odour (requiring an overall median of 293 trials). Findings complement
   previous studies on the role of acoustic signalling and suggest that
   olfaction may be an important additional mechanism for species
   discrimination.},

Title = {Differences in infection patterns of vector-borne blood-stage parasites
   of sympatric Malagasy primate species (Microcebus murinus, M.
   ravelobensis)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The dynamic relationship of vector-borne parasites, arthropod vectors
   and their hosts is prone to change under the influence of climate
   change, global integration, shifting demographics and deforestation. It
   is therefore essential to better understand parasitism in wildlife
   populations, including parasites transmitted by blood-feeding vectors,
   and explore host range and heterogeneity of parasitic infections. We
   investigated Giemsa stained blood smears of two sympatric Malagasy
   primate species (Microcebus murinus: 184 samples from 69 individuals and
   M. ravelobensis: 264 samples from 91 individuals) for blood-stage
   parasites and tested for a potential influence of host species, sex,
   body mass and sampling month on blood-stage parasite prevalence and
   infection intensity. No protozoan parasites were detected in either host
   species. A host-specific difference was observed in filarial nematode
   infections, with higher risk of infection in M. murinus (prevalence
   30.43\%), than in M. ravelobensis (prevalence 6.59\%), which may be
   explained by differences in host behavior and/or immune competence,
   linked to the period of host-parasite coevolution. Neither sex nor
   sampling month influenced infection prevalence or intensity
   significantly. We did not observe a negative effect of microfilarial
   infections on host fitness when taking body mass as a proxy. Our results
   support the hypothesis of a long-term evolutionary adaptation of hosts
   and parasites, leading to persistent infection with low morbidity.
   Morphological and molecular analyses indicate the finding of a new
   species, ``Lemurfilaria lemuris{''}. Genetic analysis furthermore showed
   > 99\% sequence identity with microfilariae described from a sympatric,
   larger-bodied lemur species of a different genus, suggesting low
   host-specificity of the detected filariae and pathogen transmission
   across genus boundaries. Findings contribute to a more comprehensive
   picture of vector-borne diseases of Malagasy lemurs.},

Title = {DiceCT Analysis of the Extreme Gouging Adaptations Within the

Abstract = {Relative to all other primates, the aye-aye (Daubentonia
   madagascariensis) exists at the extremes of both morphology and
   behavior. Its specialized anatomy-which includes hypselodont incisors
   and highly derived manual digits-reflects a dietary niche, unique among
   primates, which combines tap-foraging with gouging to locate and extract
   wood-boring larvae. Here, we explore the impact of this extreme dietary
   ecology upon the masticatory musculature of this taxon with reference to
   a second, similarly sized but highly generalist lemuriform-the mongoose
   lemur (Eulemur mongoz). Using non-destructive, high-resolution
   diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography
   techniques, we reconstruct the three-dimensional volumes of eight
   masticatory muscles, and, for the first time in strepsirrhines, isolate
   and visualize their constituent muscle fascicles in situ and in three
   dimensions. Using these data, we report muscle volumes, forces, and
   fascicle lengths from each muscle portion, as well as their orientation
   relative to two standardized anatomical planes. Our findings demonstrate
   the overbuilt nature of the aye-aye's masticatory apparatus, in which
   each muscle possesses an absolutely and relatively larger muscle volume
   and PCSA than its counterpart in the mongoose lemur. Likewise, for
   several adductor muscles, aye-ayes also possess relatively greater
   fascicle lengths. Finally, we note several unusual features within the
   lateral pterygoid of the aye-aye-the muscle most responsible for jaw
   protrusion-that relate to force maximization and reorientation. As this
   jaw motion is critical to gouging, we interpret these differences to
   reflect highly specific specializations that facilitate the aye-aye's
   extreme subsistence strategy. Anat Rec, 2019. (c) 2019 American

   impacts. Investigation of the chronology of these events is challenging
   because few localities document pre-Holocene communities not impacted by
   humans. Caves with extinct lemurs of large body size comprise some of
   Madagascar's richest subfossil sites, but provide only a limited window
   into the island's past. Open highland sites may have fewer primates, but
   may better document other megafauna, and allow the analysis of the role
   of the Central Highlands as refugia and as corridors for the dispersal
   of vertebrates before and after human arrival. Here we present a new
   subfossil site, Tsaramody (Sambaina basin, Central Madagascar), a
   high-altitude wetland area that preserves a diverse late glacial and
   postglacial vertebrate community. Tsaramody bears testimony to
   fluctuations in the highland flora during the transition from glacial to
   postglacial conditions, and the composition of a highland vertebrate
   community before humans arrived. We compare its biota to those of other
   sites to begin to document the decline and disappearance of megafauna
   from some of Madagascar's open ecosystems - wetlands dominated by
   hippopotamuses and crocodylians.},

Title = {Subordination signals improve the quality of social relationships in
   Verreaux's Sifaka: Implications for the evolution of power structures
   and social complexity},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {169},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives Unidirectional dominance-related signals can be used to
   communicate submission (an immediate behavioral response) or
   subordination (the status of an established relationship). Subordination
   signals are defined as emitted during peaceful interactions and are
   hypothesized to be critical for the evolution of social complexity and
   robust power structures because they reduce uncertainty in social
   relationships. The chatter vocalization in Verreaux's sifaka
   (Propithecus verreauxi) is a unidirectional submissive signal. I tested
   the hypothesis that chatter vocalizations can signal subordination and
   thereby reduce agonism in a dyad. Materials and Methods I examined 780
   chatters from 18 dyads collected over 881 observation hours on four
   groups of sifaka in Kirindy Forest, Madagascar. Results Sifaka emitted
   63\% of chatters in the peaceful context. Peaceful chatters
   significantly predicted grooming rate, fighting rate, reconciliation,
   and proportion of wins in a dyad but did not predict time in proximity.
   Dyad-type significantly predicted the frequency of peaceful chatters,
   with intrasexual dyads exhibiting chatters in peaceful contexts more
   often than intersexual dyads. Discussion Sifaka communicate both
   submission and subordination with chatter vocalizations. Subordination
   signaling increased tolerance and affiliation. It reduced conflicts and
   the probability dominant individuals usurped resources. Moreover,
   intrasexual power may be more institutionalized than intersexual power
   in sifaka. The finding of complex and cognitively demanding social
   communication in a lemur with low levels of cooperation (1) challenges
   previous assumptions that the evolution of social complexity is
   dependent on frequent triadic interactions and high levels of
   cooperation, and (2) highlights the need for taxonomic diversity in
   studies of social complexity.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal distribution of individuals as an indicator for the
   social system of Lepilemur sahamalaza},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {81},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Primate social systems are highly diverse, complicating the
   classification of particularly elusive species that are difficult to
   observe. The spatial distribution of individuals over time is a critica
   lindicator for the social organization and long-term studies are
   important to establish patterns of social interactions. In recent years,
   species of the cryptic, nocturnal sportive lemurs of the genus Lepilemur
   were found to live in pairs in which a single male and a single female
   share and defend a mutual home range. The present study aimed to forward
   research into this underrepresented genus by determining the social
   organization and structure of the Sahamalaza sportive lemur, L.
   sahamalaza. We collected 773.15 hr of behavioral and GPS data during a
   period of 10 months (between 2015 and 2016) on 14 individuals: eight
   females and six males. There was no evidence of pair-specific home range
   use as intra- and intersexual home range overlap was high. No pattern of
   social interactions between focal individuals could be distinguished
   despite high range overlap. Individuals met and interacted infrequently,
   resulting in an interaction rate of 0.32 interactions/hr. Sleeping
   associations between adult individuals were never observed. While both
   sexes had access to multiple potential mating partners, range sizes or
   ranging distances did not increase in mating periods. Overall, the
   social system of Sahamalaza sportive lemurs exhibits aspects of a
   solitary social organization and structure with potential for the
   polygamous mating system. These findings underline the importance of
   detailed social ecology studies that can provide the basis for
   understanding potential environmental influences on social system
   variability of closely related species.},

Title = {Early primate evolution: insights into the functional significance of
   grasping from motion analyses of extant mammals},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {127},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {611-631},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Despite differences in the assumed ecological context in competing
   evolutionary scenarios for early primate locomotion, there appears to be
   consensus about the adaptive significance of grasping for the
   exploitation of the terminal branch habitat. I attempt to review first
   the phylogenetic framework of early primate evolution. Then, I focus on
   proposed extant analogues for potential ancestral morphotypes of early
   primate evolution and motion analyses conducted to gain insight
   specifically into the role of grasping during small-branch locomotion.
   Studies concerned with proposed extant analogues, such as treeshrews,
   didelphid marsupials, mouse lemurs, tamarins and marmosets, marsupial
   gliders and various small arboreal rodents, are summarized. This
   overview demonstrates a striking variability and plasticity of
   strategies to cope with the challenging functional demands of locomotion
   in the terminal branch habitat and helps to identify open questions for
   further research. For example, potential morphological correlates for
   specific behaviours still need to be validated in future in-depth
   quantitative experimental studies. Comparative approaches beyond the
   anatomy that specifically account for data on locomotor and postural
   behaviour of extant species, also including phylogenetically informed
   analyses, are mostly lacking and should be intended to link evolutionary
   patterns of morphological change with functional characteristics
   observed in experimental studies.},

Title = {Temporal niche separation between the two ecologically similar nocturnal
   primates Avahi meridionalis and Lepilemur fleuretae},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {73},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Time is considered a resource in limited supply, and temporal niche
   separation is one of the most common strategies that allow ecologically
   similar species to live in sympatry. Mechanisms of temporal niche
   separation are understudied especially in cryptic animals due to
   logistical problems in gathering adequate data. Using high-frequency
   accelerometers attached to radio-collars, we investigated whether the
   ecologically similar lemurs Avahi meridionalis and Lepilemur fleuretae
   in the lowland rainforest of Tsitongambarika, south-eastern Madagascar,
   show temporal niche separation. Accelerometers stored data with a
   frequency of 1Hz for a total of 71days on three individuals of A.
   meridionalis and three individuals of L. fleuretae. We extrapolated
   motor activity patterns via the unsupervised learning algorithm
   expectation maximisation and validated the results with systematic
   behavioural observations. Avahi meridionalis showed peaks of activity at
   twilights with low but consistent activity during the day, while L.
   fleuretae exhibited more activity in the central hours of the night.
   Both lemur species had their activity pattern entrained by photoperiodic
   variations. The pair-living A. meridionalis was found to be lunarphilic
   while the solitary-living L. fleuretae was lunarphobic. We suggest that
   these activity differences were advantageous to minimise feeding
   competition, as an anti-predator strategy, and/or for dietary-related
   benefits. These findings demonstrate a fine-tuned temporal partitioning
   in sympatric, ecologically similar lemur species and support the idea
   that an activity spread over the 24-h, defined here as cathemerality
   sensu lato, is more common than previously thought in lemurs.
   Significance statement
   Ecologically similar species may exhibit temporal niche partitioning and
   separate their peaks of activity when co-occurring in an area. We show
   for the first time that the mainly nocturnal genus Avahi can exhibit
   high crepuscular activity with low but consistent bouts of activity (up
   to 44.6\% of daily activity) during the day. We defined this activity as
   cathemerality sensu lato as opposed to the cathemerality sensu stricto
   observed in Eulemur sp. We suggest that this flexible activity may be
   advantageous for the species to minimise feeding competition and
   predatory pressure, and/or to provide dietary-related benefits. This
   finding in the secondary nocturnal genus Avahi supports the idea that
   activity patterns in lemurs are graded and traditional categorisations
   are inadequate.},

Abstract = {Recently, organ transplant therapy has received a major boost from a
   change in perspective - a move away from damaging, cold static organ
   storage to the use of warm normothermic perfusion. The concept for warm
   preservation is one that has been borrowed from Nature, and it is only
   fitting that we go back to the wild for more ` tricks' to further
   improve warm organ stabilization. Current warm preservation strategies
   are designed to mimic natural conditions in the human body as closely as
   possible, but what if we could mimic these conditions while
   simultaneously inducing a reversible state of torpor that would further
   extend the viability window of donor organs? Indeed, the original driver
   for using cold organ storage was its ability to strongly reduce
   metabolic rate many- fold when organs were cooled from 37 to 5 degrees
   C. Herein, we discuss the adaptations that allow warm hibernators such
   as bears and lemurs (fellow primates) to naturally depress their
   metabolic rate and retreat into states of suspended animation, and how
   these can be applied to improve organ transplant therapy. Can we look to
   Nature for instructions to induce torpor in human organs? This article
   discusses the possibilities.},

Abstract = {As predicted by sexual selection theory, males are larger than females
   in most polygynous mammals, but recent studies found that ecology and
   life history traits also affect sexual size dimorphism (SSD) through
   evolutionary changes in either male size, female size, or both. The
   primates of Madagascar (Lemuriformes) represent the largest group of
   mammals without male-biased SSD. The eco-evo-devo hypothesis posited
   that adaptations to unusual climatic unpredictability on Madagascar have
   ultimately reduced SSD in lemurs after dispersing to Madagascar, but
   data have not been available for comparative tests of the corresponding
   predictions that SSD is also absent in other terrestrial Malagasy
   mammals and that patterns of SSD changed following the colonization of
   Madagascar. We used phylogenetic methods and new body mass data to test
   these predictions among the four endemic radiations of Malagasy
   primates, carnivorans, tenrecs, and rodents. In support of our
   prediction, we found that male-biased SSD is generally absent among all
   Malagasy mammals. Phylogenetic comparative analyses further indicated
   that after their independent colonization of Madagascar, SSD decreased
   in primates and tenrecs, but not in the other lineages or when analyzed
   across all species. We discuss several mechanisms that may have
   generated these patterns and conclude that neither the eco-evo-devo
   hypothesis, founder effects, the island rule nor sexual selection theory
   alone can provide a compelling explanation for the observed patterns of
   SSD in Malagasy mammals.},

Title = {Nocturnal Primate Communication: Ecology, Evolution and Conservation},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {90},
Number = {5},
Pages = {273-278},
Abstract = {Auditory, visual and olfactory cues play varying roles in non-human
   primate communication, and these systems have been intensively studied
   over the last several decades. The use of vocalisations as a primary
   mode of communication has been the focus of much research, especially in
   attempts to understand the origins of human language, with a major focus
   on anthropoid primates and diurnal lemurs. Over the last decade,
   technological advances have allowed researchers to begin to conduct
   in-depth investigations into the communication systems exhibited by the
   nocturnal and cathemeral prosimian primates, including tarsiers, lemurs
   and lorises. Understanding how nocturnal prosimians use visual,
   olfactory and auditory cues is vital for reconstructing the origins of
   primate communication systems. In this special issue, we highlight some
   of the more exciting advances in the communication strategies of the
   prosimians. Contributions come from work conducted in Kenya, Tanzania,
   Senegal, Rwanda, Madagascar and the Indonesian islands of Java and
   Sulawesi. Topics will include: the description of novel ultrasonic
   vocalisations, including frequency and function of these newly
   discovered calls; the possible use of vocalisations to navigate and
   assemble at sleep sites; the importance of species-specific contact
   vocalisations for the identification of new species; the use of urinary
   and glandular signals to communicate and the methods developed to
   understand this complex communication in the field; the use of
   vocalisations for niche separation among nocturnal primates from
   mainland Africa and Madagascar; and whether or not we can use new
   technologies to discern whether prosimians use vocalisations for
   individual identification of group members. We discuss the importance of
   new field methods including novel equipment and techniques, the use of
   vocalisation to influence conservation practices and the importance of
   comparing across prosimian taxa to reconstruct the communication systems
   of our early primate ancestors. (c) 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 21},
Abstract = {Within current theories on potential adaptive manipulation of offspring
   sex ratio, giving birth to a male or to a female is assumed to depend on
   the capacity of the mother to invest in offspring to maximize her
   fitness. The active role of the father in sex ratio bias at birth has
   been neglected until recently. The human sex ratio at birth is biased
   towards sons, although in occidental populations, the ratio has
   decreased regularly for 30 years and could be the consequence of the
   adverse effects of environmental chemicals on male hormones. In a
   Malagasy primate, the lesser mouse lemur, the potential effect of
   paternal testosterone levels on sex ratio bias at birth was tested on
   130 litters (278 babies) produced in 52 mixed-sex groups. For each
   group, social dominance among males was characterized based on
   aggressive interactions and sexual behaviours. Using a multi
   correspondence analysis, high testosterone levels in grouped males,
   particularly those of the dominant male, were significantly correlated
   with more infants produced in male-biased litters, independent of the
   female condition. According to these results, predictions for sex ratio
   bias towards one sex or the other in mouse lemurs were discussed
   considering the influence of both parents.},

Title = {Do forelimb shape and peak forces co-vary in strepsirrhines?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {167},
Number = {3},
Pages = {602-614},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objectives
   In this study, we explore whether ground reaction forces recorded during
   horizontal walking co-vary with the shape of the long bones of the
   forelimb in strepsirrhines. To do so, we quantify (1) the shape of the
   shaft and articular surfaces of each long bone of the forelimb, (2) the
   peak vertical, mediolateral, and horizontal ground reaction forces
   applied by the forelimb during arboreal locomotion, and (3) the
   relationship between the shape of the forelimb and peak forces.
   Materials and methodsResultsGeometric morphometric approaches were used
   to quantify the shape of the bones. Kinetic data were collected during
   horizontal arboreal walking in eight species of strepsirrhines that show
   variation in habitual substrate use and morphology of the forelimb.
   These data were then used to explore the links between locomotor
   behavior, morphology, and mechanics using co-variation analyses in a
   phylogenetic framework.
   Our results show significant differences between slow quadrupedal
   climbers (lorises), vertical clinger and leapers (sifaka), and active
   arboreal quadrupeds (ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemur) in both ground
   reaction forces and the shape of the long bones of the forelimb, with
   the propulsive and medially directed peak forces having the highest
   impact on the shape of the humerus. Co-variation between long bone shape
   and ground reaction forces was detected in both the humerus and ulna
   even when accounting for differences in body mass.
   DiscussionThese results demonstrate the importance of considering
   limb-loading beyond just peak vertical force, or substrate reaction
   force. A re-evaluation of osseous morphology and functional
   interpretations is necessary in light of these findings.},

Title = {Linking cognition with fitness in a wild primate: fitness correlates of

Journal = {PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {373},

Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Linking the cognitive performance of wild animals with fitness
   consequences is crucial for understanding evolutionary processes that
   shape individual variation in cognition. However, the few studies that
   have examined these links revealed differing relationships between
   various cognitive performance measures and fitness proxies. To
   contribute additional comparative data to this body of research, we
   linked individual performance during repeated problem-solving and
   spatial learning ability in a maze with body condition and survival in
   wild grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). All four variables
   exhibited substantial inter-individual variation. Solving efficiency in
   the problem-solving task, but not spatial learning performance,
   predicted the magnitude of change in body condition after the harsh dry
   season, indicating that the ability to quickly apply a newly discovered
   motor technique might also facilitate exploitation of new, natural food
   resources. Survival was not linked with performance in both tasks,
   however, suggesting that mouse lemurs' survival might not depend on the
   cognitive performances addressed here. Our study is the first linking
   cognition with fitness proxies in a wild primate species, and our
   discussion highlights the importance and challenges of accounting for a
   species' life history and ecology in choosing meaningful cognitive and
   fitness variables for a study in the wild.

   individual differences in cognitive abilities'.},

Abstract = {Previous research suggests that people first arrived on Madagascar by
   similar to 2500 years before present (years B.P.). This hypothesis is

   fractures consistent with immobilization and dismemberment. Our evidence
   for anthropogenic perimortem modification of directly dated bones
   represents the earliest indication of humans in Madagascar, predating
   all other archaeological and genetic evidence by >6000 years and

Abstract = {A recent study suggests that a specific, touchscreen-based task on
   visual object-location paired-associates learning (PAL), the so-called
   Different PAL (dPAL) task, allows effective translation from animal
   models to humans. Here, we adapted the task to a nonhuman primate (NHP),
   the gray mouse lemur, and provide first evidence for the successful
   comparative application of the task to humans and NHPs. Young human
   adults reach the learning criterion after considerably less sessions
   (one order of magnitude) than young, adult NHPs, which is likely due to
   faster and voluntary rejection of ineffective learning strategies in
   humans and almost immediate rule generalization. At criterion, however,
   all human subjects solved the task by either applying a visuospatial
   rule or, more rarely, by memorizing all possible stimulus combinations
   and responding correctly based on global visual information. An
   error-profile analysis in humans and NHPs suggests that successful
   learning in NHPs is comparably based either on the formation of
   visuospatial associative links or on more reflexive, visually guided
   stimulus-response learning. The classification in the NHPs is further
   supported by an analysis of the individual response latencies, which are
   considerably higher in NHPs classified as spatial learners. Our results,
   therefore, support the high translational potential of the standardized,
   touchscreen-based dPAL task by providing first empirical and comparable
   evidence for two different cognitive processes underlying dPAL
   performance in primates.},

Title = {LMTK3 confers chemo-resistance in breast cancer},

Abstract = {Lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) is an oncogenic kinase that is involved
   in different types of cancer (breast, lung, gastric, colorectal) and
   biological processes including proliferation, invasion, migration,
   chromatin remodeling as well as innate and acquired endocrine
   resistance. However, the role of LMTK3 in response to cytotoxic
   chemotherapy has not been investigated thus far. Using both 2D and 3D
   tissue culture models, we found that overexpression of LMTK3 decreased
   the sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to cytotoxic (doxorubicin)
   treatment. In a mouse model we showed that ectopic overexpression of
   LMTK3 decreases the efficacy of doxorubicin in reducing tumor growth.
   Interestingly, breast cancer cells overexpressing LMTK3 delayed the
   generation of double strand breaks (DSBs) after exposure to doxorubicin,
   as measured by the formation of gamma H2AX foci. This effect was at
   least partly mediated by decreased activity of ataxia-telangiectasia
   mutated kinase (ATM) as indicated by its reduced phosphorylation levels.
   In addition, our RNA-seq analyses showed that doxorubicin differentially
   regulated the expression of over 700 genes depending on LMTK3 protein
   expression levels. Furthermore, these genes were found to promote DNA
   repair, cell viability and tumorigenesis processes / pathways in
   LMTK3-overexpressing MCF7 cells. In human cancers, immunohistochemistry
   staining of LMTK3 in pre- and postchemotherapy breast tumor pairs from
   four separate clinical cohorts revealed a significant increase of LMTK3
   following both doxorubicin and docetaxel based chemotherapy. In
   aggregate, our findings show for the first time a contribution of LMTK3
   in cytotoxic drug resistance in breast cancer.},

Abstract = {A whole suite of parameters is likely to influence the behavior and
   performance of individuals as adults, including correlations between
   phenotypic traits or an individual's developmental context. Here, we ask
   the question whether behavior and physical performance traits are
   correlated and how early life parameters such as birth weight, litter
   size, and growth can influence these traits as measured during
   adulthood. We studied 486 captive gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus)
   and measured two behavioral traits and two performance traits
   potentially involved in two functions: exploration behavior with pull
   strength and agitation score with bite force. We checked for the
   existence of behavioral consistency in behaviors and explored
   correlations between behavior, performance, morphology. We analyzed the
   effect of birth weight, growth, and litter size, while controlling for
   age, sex, and body weight. Behavior and performance were not correlated
   with one another, but were both influenced by age. Growth rate had a
   positive effect on adult morphology, and birth weight significantly
   affected emergence latency and bite force. Grip strength was not
   directly affected by early life traits, but bite performance and
   exploration behavior were impacted by birth weight. This study shows how
   early life parameters impact personality and performance.},

Abstract = {Peltophryne armata sp. nov. is described from the South paleoisland of
   Hispaniola, West Indies. This is the only native toad species known to
   inhabit the Barahona Peninsula, Dominican Republic, in the southernmost
   part of Hispaniola, and it is allopatric with the widely distributed
   Hispaniolan toad species, P. guentheri Cochran. However, in a molecular
   phylogeny, the closest relative of P. armata sp. nov. is the Puerto
   Rican species P. lemur Cope, with which it shares a protrusive snout,
   large orbits, a depressed head, indistinct or absent infraorbital
   crests, and a long and complex advertisement call, but differs from it
   greatly by the very long cephalic crests, and in the massive and spinose
   parotoid glands that converge medially on the dorsum. The new species is
   similar in ecology and larval morphology to the Cuban P. florentinoi
   Moreno \& Rivalta, but differs from it in adult morphology. The tadpole
   of the new species is described. Peltophryne fracta is placed in the
   synonymy of P. guentheri.},

Title = {Interannual Variation in Diet, Dietary Diversity, and Dietary Overlap in
   Three Sympatric Strepsirrhine Species in Southeastern Madagascar},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {289-311},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Dietary data are used to categorize species diets, but these
   categorizations do not take into account the mutability of food
   resources in time or space, the level of interspecific competition in
   various communities as these resources change, nor the dietary
   flexibility of species. In this study, we assess the diets of three
   sympatric species, Eulemur rufifrons, Propithecus edwardsi, and Varecia
   variegata, in the Vatoharanana site in Ranomafana National Park,
   Madagascar. We determine dietary diversity, overlap, and interannual
   variation with data collected from 2001 to 2003. We then compare results
   on food preference and time feeding with data collected on each species
   in the late 1980s and early 1990s to determine whether these findings
   are consistent over the long term. We found little interannual variation
   in the proportion of time spent eating particular plant parts for each
   of the lemur species during the three study years (2001-2003), and
   between the earlier and current study. Food items were not always
   consumed based solely on availability. Dietary diversity was lower in
   the two frugivorous species (V. variegata and E. rufifrons) compared
   with the folivorous species (P. edwardsi), and V. variegata and E.
   rufifrons were more likely to focus their feeding time on one particular
   genus and plant part in each year. The study species used different
   strategies to deal with food, particularly fruit, shortages such as a
   plastic social structure (V. variegata), habitat shifting (E.
   rufifrons), and dietary switching (P. edwardsi). Although there was low
   dietary overlap between the study species, they depended on a small
   number of shared fruits in each of the study years (Chrysophyllum,
   Syzygium, Ocotea, Plagioscyphus), which may indicate some potential for
   interspecific competition. Because these lemur species, like all
   primates, lead relatively long lives (avg. > 30 years) and have slow
   rates of aging, longitudinal studies are needed to test hypotheses
   reliant on basic dietary information.},

Title = {Curious creatures: a multi-taxa investigation of responses to novelty in
   a zoo environment},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {The personality trait of curiosity has been shown to increase welfare in
   humans. If this positive welfare effect is also true for non-humans,
   animals with high levels of curiosity may be able to cope better with
   stressful situations than their conspecifics. Before discoveries can be
   made regarding the effect of curiosity on an animals ability to cope in
   their environment, a way of measuring curiosity across species in
   different environments must be created to standardise testing. To
   determine the suitability of novel objects in testing curiosity, species
   from different evolutionary backgrounds with sufficient sample sizes
   were chosen. Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia) n = 12, little penguins
   (Eudyptula minor) n = 10, ringtail lemurs (Lemur catta) n = 8, red
   tailed black cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus banksia) n = 7, Indian star
   tortoises (Geochelone elegans) n = 5 and red kangaroos (Macropus rufus)
   n = 5 were presented with a stationary object, a moving object and a
   mirror. Having objects with different characteristics increased the
   likelihood individuals would find at least one motivating. Conspecifics
   were all assessed simultaneously for time to first orientate towards
   object (s), latency to make contact (s), frequency of interactions, and
   total duration of interaction (s). Differences in curiosity were
   recorded in four of the six species; the Barbary sheep and red tailed
   black cockatoos did not interact with the novel objects suggesting
   either a low level of curiosity or that the objects were not motivating
   for these animals. Variation in curiosity was seen between and within
   species in terms of which objects they interacted with and how long they
   spent with the objects. This was determined by the speed in which they
   interacted, and the duration of interest. By using the measure of
   curiosity towards novel objects with varying characteristics across a
   range of zoo species, we can see evidence of evolutionary, husbandry and
   individual influences on their response. Further work to obtain data on
   multiple captive populations of a single species using a standardised
   method could uncover factors that nurture the development of curiosity.
   In doing so, it would be possible to isolate and modify sub-optimal
   husbandry practices to improve welfare in the zoo environment.},

Abstract = {Detecting interaction between species is notoriously difficult, and
   disentangling species associations in host-related gut communities is
   especially challenging. Nevertheless, due to contemporary methods,
   including metabarcoding and 16S sequencing, collecting observational
   data on community composition has become easier and much more common.
   We studied the previously collected datasets of intestinal bacterial
   microbiota and parasite compositions within longitudinally followed
   mouse lemurs by analysing the potential interactions with diversity
   metrics and novel joint species distribution modelling.
   Both methods showed statistical association between certain parasite
   species and bacterial microbiota composition. Unicellular Eimeria sp.
   had an effect on diversity of gut microbiota. The cestode Hymenolepis
   diminuta had negative associations with several bacterial orders,
   whereas closely related species Hymenolepis nana had positive
   associations with several bacterial orders.
   Our results reveal potential interactions between some, but not all,
   intestinal parasites and gut bacterial microbiota. Host variables
   contributed over half of the total variation explained with the model,
   and sex was the most important single host variable; especially with
   microbiota, there were sex-related differences in the community
   composition.
   This study shows how joint species distribution modelling can
   incorporate both within-host dynamics of several taxa and host
   characteristics to model potential interactions in intestinal community.
   These results provide new hypothesis for interactions between and among
   parasites and bacterial microbiota to be tested further with
   experimental studies.},

Abstract = {Genetic analyses are well suited to address many research questions in
   the study of wild populations, yet species of interest often have
   distributions that are geographically distant from molecular
   laboratories, necessitating potentially lengthy transport of biological
   specimens. Performing basic genetic analyses on site would avoid the
   project delays and risks of sample quality decline associated with
   transport, as well as allow original specimens to remain in the country
   of origin. Further, diagnostic genetic assays performed in the field
   could provide real-time information allowing for more nimble adjustments
   to research plans and use of resources. To this end, we developed
   protocols for reliably performing front-end genetics bench work in the
   field, without the requirements of electricity or permanent shelter. We
   validated these protocols on buccal swabs collected during routine
   capturing of sifaka lemurs (Propithecus verreauxi) at BezA Mahafaly
   Special Reserve in Southwest Madagascar and faecal samples collected
   from captive sifakas (P. coquereli) at the Duke Lemur Center. Our basic
   protocol pipeline involves a chelating resin based DNA extraction
   followed by whole genome amplification or polymerase chain reaction
   using reagents stored at ambient temperature and portable, compact
   equipment powered by a lightweight solar panel. We achieved a high
   success rate (> 80\%) in downstream procedures, demonstrating the
   promise of such protocols for performing basic genetic analyses in a
   broad range of field situations.},

Title = {Estimating body size in early primates: The case of Archicebus and

Volume = {115},

Abstract = {Obtaining accurate estimations of the body mass of fossil primates has
   always been a subject of interest in paleoanthropology because mass is
   an important determinant for so many other aspects of biology, ecology,
   and life history. This paper focuses on the issues involved in
   attempting to reconstruct the mass of two early Eocene haplorhine
   primates, Teilhardina and Archicebus, which pose particular problems due
   to their small size and temporal and phylogenetic distance from extant
   primates. In addition to a ranking of variables from more to less
   useful, the effect of using models of varying taxonomic and size
   compositions is examined. Phylogenetic correction is also applied to the
   primate database. Our results indicate that the choice of variable is
   more critical than the choice of model. The more reliable variables are
   the mediolateral breadth across the femoral condyles and the area of the
   calcaneocuboid facet of the calcaneus. These variables suggest a body
   mass of 39 g (range 33-46 g) for Archicebus and 48 g (range 44-56 g) for
   Teilhardina. The width of the distal femur is found to be the most
   consistent estimator across models of various composition and
   techniques. The effect of phylogenetic correction is small but the
   choice of branch length assumption affects point estimates for the
   fossils. The majority of variables and models predict the body mass of
   Archicebus and Teilhardina to be in the range of the smaller extant
   mouse lemurs, as expected. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We present a new method of primate face recognition, and evaluate this
   method on several endangered primates, including golden monkeys, lemurs,
   and chimpanzees. The three datasets contain a total of 11,637 images of
   280 individual primates from 14 species. Primate face recognition
   performance is evaluated using two existing state-of-the-art open
   -source systems, (1) FaceNet and (ii) SphereFace, (iii) a lemur face
   recognition system :from literature, and (iv) our new convolutional
   neural network (CNN) architecture called PrimNet. Three recognition
   scenarios are considered: verification (1:1 comparison), and both open
   -set and closed -set identification (1:N search). We demonstrate that
   PrimNet outperforms all of the other systems in all three scenarios for
   all primate species tested. Finally, we implement an Android application
   of this recognition system to be assist primate researchers and
   conservationists in the wild for individual recognition of primates.},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Animals with dietary specializations can be used to link climate to
   specific ecological drivers of endangerment. Only two mammals, the giant
   panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in Asia and the greater bamboo lemur
   (Prolemur simus) in Madagascar, consume the nutritionally poor and
   mechanically challenging culm or trunk of woody bamboos {[}1-3]. Even
   though the greater bamboo lemur is critically endangered,
   paleontological evidence shows that it was once broadly distributed
   {[}4, 5]. Here, integrating morphological, paleontological, and
   ecological evidence, we project the effects of climate change on greater
   bamboo lemurs. Both the giant panda and the greater bamboo lemur are
   shown to share diagnostic dental features indicative of a bamboo diet,
   thereby providing an ecometric indicator {[}6, 7] of diet preserved in
   the fossil record. Analyses of bamboo feeding in living populations show
   that bamboo culm is consumed only during the dry season and that the
   greater bamboo lemur is currently found in regions with the shortest dry
   season. In contrast, paleontological localities of the greater bamboo
   lemurs have the longest dry seasons. Future projections show that many
   presentday greater bamboo lemur populations will experience prolonged
   dry seasons similar to those of the localities where only fossils of the
   greater bamboo lemur are found. Whereas abundant foods such as bamboo
   allow feeding specialists to thrive, even a moderate change in
   seasonality may outstrip the capacity of greater bamboo lemurs to
   persist on their mechanically demanding food source. Coupling known
   changes in species distribution with high-resolution ecological and
   historical data helps to identify extinction risks.},

Abstract = {Urine is involved in sexual communication in New World monkeys and
   lemurs, but most studies of the role of olfaction in sexual
   communication in Old World monkeys have focused on vaginal secretions
   rather than urine. We investigated whether female urine promotes male
   sexual behaviors (approaches and inspections of genital area) in
   Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). We used a sequential presentation
   paradigm in behavioral experiments, presenting unfamiliar female urine
   and control cotton swabs to males living in a social group with cycling
   females. We tested whether males (N = 3) showed more processing
   behaviors (licking, sniffing, tasting) toward female urine (22 stimuli
   per male from prefertile, fertile, and postfertile phases, based on
   urinary estrone and progesterone conjugate profiles) than control odor
   (8 stimuli per male). We then compared male sexual behaviors toward
   resident females pre- and post-exposure to stimuli and in relation to
   the females' reproductive status (perifertile, nonfertile, and pregnancy
   periods, based on fecal estrone and progesterone conjugate profiles). We
   found that males showed significantly more processing behaviors toward
   urine stimuli than to controls but that male behavior did not vary
   across urine samples from prefertile, fertile, and postfertile phases.
   Exposure to unfamiliar female urine stimuli did not modulate male
   approaches to and inspections of resident females at any stage of the
   female reproductive cycle. Although our study is limited by its small
   sample size, the results suggest that female urine contains compounds
   that males detect, but we found no evidence that female urine is related
   to male sexual behaviors.},

Abstract = {The relative effect of past climate fluctuations and anthropogenic
   activities on current biome distribution is subject to increasing
   attention, notably in biodiversity hot spots. In Madagascar, where
   humans arrived in the last similar to 4 to 5,000years, the exact causes
   of the demise of large vertebrates that cohabited with humans are yet
   unclear. The prevailing narrative holds that Madagascar was covered with
   forest before human arrival and that the expansion of grasslands was the
   result of human-driven deforestation. However, recent studies have shown
   that vegetation and fauna structure substantially fluctuated during the
   Holocene. Here, we study the Holocene history of habitat fragmentation
   in the north of Madagascar using a population genetics approach. To do
   so, we infer the demographic history of two northern Madagascar
   neighbouring, congeneric and critically endangered forest dwelling lemur
   speciesPropithecus tattersalli and Propithecus perrieriusing population
   genetic analyses. Our results highlight the necessity to consider
   population structure and changes in connectivity in demographic history
   inferences. We show that both species underwent demographic fluctuations
   which most likely occurred after the mid-Holocene transition. While
   mid-Holocene climate change probably triggered major demographic changes
   in the two lemur species range and connectivity, human settlements that
   expanded over the last four millennia in northern Madagascar likely
   played a role in the loss and fragmentation of the forest cover.},

Title = {On specimen killing in the era of conservation crisis - A quantitative
   case for modernizing taxonomy and biodiversity inventories},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Background to the work
   For centuries taxonomy has relied on dead animal specimens, a practice
   that persists today despite the emergence of innovative biodiversity
   assessment methods. Taxonomists and conservationists are engaged in
   vigorous discussions over the necessity of killing animals for specimen
   sampling, but quantitative data on taxonomic trends and specimen
   sampling over time, which could inform these debates, are lacking.
   Methods
   We interrogated a long-term research database documenting 2,723 land
   vertebrate and 419 invertebrate taxa from Madagascar, and their
   associated specimens conserved in the major natural history museums. We
   further compared specimen collection and species description rates for
   the birds, mammals and scorpions over the last two centuries, to
   identify trends and links to taxon descriptions.
   Results
   We located 15,364 specimens documenting endemic mammals and 11,666
   specimens documenting endemic birds collected between 1820 and 2010.
   Most specimens were collected at the time of the Mission Zoologique
   Franco-Anglo-Ame A ricaine (MZFAA) in the 1930s and during the last two
   decades, with major differences according to the groups considered. The
   small mammal and bat collections date primarily from recent years, and
   are paralleled by the description of new species. Lemur specimens were
   collected during the MZFAA but the descriptions of new taxa are recent,
   with the type series limited to non-killed specimens. Bird specimens,
   particularly of non-passerines, are mainly from the time of the MZFAA.
   The passerines have also been intensely collected during the last two
   decades; the new material has been used to solve the phylogeny of the
   groups and only two new endemic taxa of passerine birds have been
   described over the last two decades.
   Conclusions
   Our data show that specimen collection has been critical for advancing
   our understanding of the taxonomy of Madagascar's biodiversity at the
   onset of zoological work in Madagascar, but less so in recent decades.
   It is crucial to look for alternatives to avoid killing animals in the
   name of documenting life, and encourage all efforts to share the
   information attached to historical and recent collections held in
   natural history museums. In times of conservation crisis and the
   advancement in digital technologies and open source sharing, it seems
   obsolete to kill animals in well-known taxonomic groups for the sake of
   enriching natural history collections around the world.},

Title = {Testing Convergent Evolution in Auditory Processing Genes between
   Echolocating Mammals and the Aye-Aye, a Percussive-Foraging Primate},
Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1978-1989},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Several taxonomically distinct mammalian groups-certain microbats and
   cetaceans (e.g., dolphins)-share both morphological adaptations related
   to echolocation behavior and strong signatures of convergent evolution
   at the amino acid level across seven genes related to auditory
   processing. Aye-ayes (Daubentonia madagascariensis) are nocturnal lemurs
   with a specialized auditory processing system. Aye-ayes tap rapidly
   along the surfaces of trees, listening to reverberations to identify
   themines of wood-boring insect larvae; this behavior has been
   hypothesized to functionally mimic echolocation. Here we investigated
   whether there are signals of convergence in auditory processing genes
   between aye-ayes and known mammalian echolocators. We developed a
   computational pipeline (Basic Exon Assembly Tool) that produces
   consensus sequences for regions of interest from shotgun genomic
   sequencing data for nonmodel organisms without requiring de novo genome
   assembly. We reconstructed complete coding region sequences for the
   seven convergent echolocating bat-dolphin genes for aye-ayes and another
   lemur. We compared sequences from these two lemurs in a phylogenetic
   framework with those of bat and dolphin echolocators and appropriate
   nonecholocating outgroups. Our analysis reaffirms the existence of amino
   acid convergence at these loci among echolocating bats and dolphins;
   some methods also detected signals of convergence between echolocating
   bats and both mice and elephants. However, we observed no significant
   signal of amino acid convergence between aye-ayes and echolocating bats
   and dolphins, suggesting that aye-aye tap-foraging auditory adaptations
   represent distinct evolutionary innovations. These results are also
   consistent with a developing consensus that convergent behavioral
   ecology does not reliably predict convergent molecular evolution.},

Abstract = {Age-associated cognitive impairment is a major health and social issue
   because of increasing aged population. Cognitive decline is not
   homogeneous in humans and the determinants leading to differences
   between subjects are not fully understood. In middle-aged healthy
   humans, fasting blood glucose levels in the upper normal range are
   associated with memory impairment and cerebral atrophy. Due to a close
   evolutional similarity to Man, non-human primates may be useful to
   investigate the relationships between glucose homeostasis, cognitive
   deficits and structural brain alterations. In the grey mouse lemur,
   Microcebus murinus, spatial memory deficits have been associated with
   age and cerebral atrophy but the origin of these alterations have not
   been clearly identified. Herein, we showed that, on 28 female grey mouse
   lemurs (age range 2.4-6.1 years old), age correlated with impaired
   fasting blood glucose (r(s)=0.37) but not with impaired glucose
   tolerance or insulin resistance. In middle-aged animals (4.1-6.1
   years-old), fasting blood glucose was inversely and closely linked with
   spatial memory performance (r(s)=0.56) and hippocampus (r(s)=-0.62) or
   septum (r(s)=-0.55) volumes. These findings corroborate observations in
   humans and further support the grey mouse lemur as a natural model to
   unravel mechanisms which link impaired glucose homeostasis, brain
   atrophy and cognitive processes.},

Abstract = {For generalist pathogens, host species represent distinct selective
   environments, providing unique challenges for resource acquisition and
   defense from host immunity, potentially resulting in host-dependent
   differences in pathogen fitness. Gene expression modulation should be
   advantageous, responding optimally to a given host and mitigating the
   costs of generalism. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a fungal
   pathogen of amphibians, shows variability in pathogenicity among
   isolates, and within-strain virulence changes rapidly during serial
   passages through artificial culture. For the first time, we characterize
   the transcriptomic profile of Bd in vivo, using laser-capture
   microdissection. Comparison of Bd transcriptomes (strain JEL423) in
   culture and in two hosts (Atelopus zeteki and Hylomantis lemur), reveals
   >2000 differentially expressed genes that likely include key Bd defense
   and host exploitation mechanisms. Variation in Bd transcriptomes from
   different amphibian hosts demonstrates shifts in pathogen resource
   allocation. Furthermore, expressed genotype variant frequencies of Bd
   populations differ between culture and amphibian skin, and among host
   species, revealing potential mechanisms underlying rapid changes in
   virulence and the possibility that amphibian community composition
   shapes Bd evolutionary trajectories. Our results provide new insights
   into how changes in gene expression and infecting population genotypes
   can be key to the success of a generalist fungal pathogen.},

Title = {The inbreeding strategy of a solitary primate, Microcebus murinus},

Abstract = {Inbreeding depression may be common in nature, reflecting either the
   failure of inbreeding avoidance strategies or inbreeding tolerance when
   avoidance is costly. The combined assessment of inbreeding risk,
   avoidance and depression is therefore fundamental to evaluate the
   inbreeding strategy of a population, that is how individuals respond to
   the risk of inbreeding. Here, we use the demographic and genetic
   monitoring of 10 generations of wild grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   murinus), small primates from Madagascar with overlapping generations,
   to examine their inbreeding strategy. Grey mouse lemurs have retained
   ancestral mammalian traits, including solitary lifestyle, polygynandry
   and male-biased dispersal, and may therefore offer a representative
   example of the inbreeding strategy of solitary mammals. The occurrence
   of close kin among candidate mates was frequent in young females
   (similar to 37\%, most often the father) and uncommon in young males
   (similar to 6\%) due to male-biased dispersal. However, close kin
   consistently represented a tiny fraction of candidate mates (<1\%)
   across age and sex categories. Mating biases favouring partners with
   intermediate relatedness were detectable in yearling females and adult
   males, possibly partly caused by avoidance of daughter-father matings.
   Finally, inbreeding depression, assessed as the effect of heterozygosity
   on survival, was undetectable using a capture-mark-recapture study.
   Overall, these results indicate that sex-biased dispersal is a primary
   inbreeding avoidance mechanism at the population level, and mating
   biases represent an additional strategy that may mitigate residual
   inbreeding costs at the individual level. Combined, these mechanisms
   explain the rarity of inbreeding and the lack of detectable inbreeding
   depression in this large, genetically diverse population.},

Title = {Characterization of the Tree Holes Used by Lepilemur ruficaudatus in the

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {88},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-41},
Abstract = {Knowledge of the key resources for a species is critical for developing
   an effective conservation strategy. Kirindy Mitea National Park is an
   important refuge for the redtailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur
   ruficaudatus), a nocturnal folivorous lemur endemic to the dry deciduous
   forest of western Madagascar. Because L. ruficaudatus sleeps in tree
   holes during the day, sleeping trees may be an important resource for
   this species. Our goal was to characterize the sleeping sites used by L.
   ruficaudatus at the Ankoatsifaka Research Station in Kirindy Mitea
   National Park. In July and August 2012, tree characteristics were
   recorded for 60 L. ruficaudatus sleeping sites. Intact and alive trees,
   particularly Strychnos madagascariensis, were preferred by L.
   ruficaudatus. Sleeping holes were generally located in taller trees
   (median hole height = 4 m) and in trees with large girths (median = 20.5
   cm). Greater protection from predators and thermal shifts may be
   provided by intact trees and concealed tree holes. Because tree
   characteristics can influence the presence and abundance of
   forest-living primates, the availability and characteristics of
   particular trees as potential sleeping shelters in a habitat must be
   taken into account in conservation strategies for L. ruficaudatus. (C)

Title = {Female dominance in two basal primates, Microcebus murinus and
   Microcebus lehilahytsara: variation and determinants},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {122},
Pages = {145-156},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Female social dominance over males can only be found in a small number
   of mammalian species, but is unusually concentrated among Malagasy
   lemurs. Three major hypotheses are currently discussed to explain this
   phenomenon, namely the energy conservation hypothesis, sleeping site
   hypothesis and ancestral lemur condition hypothesis. Since proximate
   determinants of female dominance have rarely been studied, this study
   aimed to investigate the influence of factors connected to these
   hypotheses, focusing on sex-specific differences in energy requirements
   and group composition in two closely related nocturnal lemur species.
   More specifically, the effects of species, season and age on agonistic
   behaviour and the expression of female dominance were tested, while the
   effects of individuality, body mass, breeding experience and habituation
   were controlled. Seasonal variations in intersexual dominance
   relationships were investigated in captivity in grey mouse lemurs,
   Microcebus murinus, a prominent female-dominant species, and Goodman's
   mouse lemurs, Microcebus lehilahytsara, whose agonistic behaviour was
   studied for the first time. Data were collected during a series of
   encounter experiments between one male and one female (15 dyads of M.
   murinus and nine of M. lehilahytsara) during the reproductive and
   nonreproductive seasons. Moderate female dominance was expressed in both
   species with females winning the majority of conflicts year round,
   independently of context. However, effects of season and species were
   found in conflict rates, in the probability for females to win
   conflicts, and in the number of dominant females. Moreover, the age
   difference between dyad partners and the breeding experience of females
   influenced whether conflicts were decided in favour of males or females.
   It can be concluded that female dominance probably represents an
   ancestral trait in mouse lemurs and it is proposed that its evolution
   might have been driven by sex-specific energetic constraints prevailing
   in the species-specific ancestral habitats, and may moreover be
   influenced by the species-specific social organization. (C) 2016 The

Title = {Primate Torpor Expression: Ghost of the Climatic Past},
Journal = {PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Number = {6},
Pages = {398-408},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Torpor, the controlled depression of virtually all bodily function
   during scarce periods, was verified in primates under free-ranging
   conditions less than two decades ago. The large variety of different
   torpor patterns found both within and among closely related species is
   particularly remarkable. To help unravel the cause of these variable
   patterns, our review investigates primate torpor use within an
   evolutionary framework. First, we provide an overview of heterothermic
   primate species, focusing on the Malagasy lemurs, and discuss their use
   of daily torpor or hibernation in relation to habitat type and climatic
   conditions. Second, we investigate environmental characteristics that
   may have been involved in shaping the high variability of torpor
   expression found in lemurs today. Third, we examine potential triggers
   for torpor use in lemurs. We propose the ``torpor refugia hypothesis{''}
   to illustrate how disparate primate torpor patterns possibly evolved in
   response to environmental cues during glacial periods, when animals were
   restricted to different refuge habitats along riverine corridors. For
   example, individuals enduring harsher conditions at higher altitudes
   likely developed seasonal hibernation, whereas those inhabiting lower
   elevation river catchments might have coped with unfavorable conditions
   by employing daily torpor. The ultimate stimuli triggering torpor use
   today likely differ between the different habitats of Madagascar. The
   broad diversity of torpor patterns in lemurs among closely related
   species, both within the same and in distinctly different habitat types,
   provides an ideal base for research into the stimuli for torpor use in
   endotherms in general. Our hypothesis highlights the importance of
   considering the environmental conditions under which ecosystems and
   species evolved when trying to explain physiological adaptations seen
   today.},

Title = {What did Hadropithecus Eat, and Why Should Paleoanthropologists Care?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {78},
Number = {10, SI},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Over 40 years ago, Clifford Jolly noted different ways in which
   Hadropithecus stenognathus converged in its craniodental anatomy with
   basal hominins and with geladas. The Malagasy subfossil lemur
   Hadropithecus departs from its sister taxon, Archaeolemur, in that it
   displays comparatively large molars, reduced incisors and canines, a
   shortened rostrum, and thickened mandibular corpus. Its molars, however,
   look nothing like those of basal hominins; rather, they much more
   closely resemble molars of grazers such as Theropithecus. A number of
   tools have been used to interpret these traits, including dental
   microwear and texture analysis, molar internal and external morphology,
   and finite element analysis of crania. These tools, however, have failed
   to provide support for a simple dietary interpretation; whereas there is
   some consistency in the inferences they support, dietary inferences
   (e.g., that it was graminivorous, or that it specialized on hard
   objects) have been downright contradictory. Cranial shape may correlate
   poorly with diet. But a fundamental question remains unresolved: why do
   the various cranial and dental convergences exemplified by
   Hadropithecus, basal hominins, and Theropithecus exist? In this paper we
   review prior hypotheses regarding the diet of Hadropithecus. We then use
   stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data to elucidate this species' diet,
   summarizing earlier stable isotope analyses and presenting new data for
   lemurs from the central highlands of Madagascar, where Hadropithecus
   exhibits an isotopic signature strikingly different from that seen in
   other parts of the island. We offer a dietary explanation for these
   differences. Hadropithecus likely specialized neither on grasses nor
   hard objects; its staples were probably the succulent leaves of CAM
   plants. Nevertheless, aspects of prior hypotheses regarding the
   ecological significance of its morphology can be supported. (C) 2015

Title = {Moderate evidence for a Lombard effect in a phylogenetically basal
   primate},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {When exposed to enhanced background noise, humans avoid signal masking
   by increasing the amplitude of the voice, a phenomenon termed the
   Lombard effect. This auditory feedback-mediated voice control has also
   been found in monkeys, bats, cetaceans, fish and some frogs and birds.
   We studied the Lombard effect for the first time in a phylogenetically
   basal primate, the grey mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus. When background
   noise was increased, mouse lemurs were able to raise the amplitude of
   the voice, comparable to monkeys, but they did not show this effect
   consistently across context/individuals. The Lombard effect, even if
   representing a generic vocal communication system property of mammals,
   may thus be affected by more complex mechanisms. The present findings
   emphasize an effect of context, and individual, and the need for further
   standardized approaches to disentangle the multiple system properties of
   mammalian vocal communication, important for understanding the evolution
   of the unique human faculty of speech and language.},

Title = {Internal carotid arterial canal size and scaling in Euarchonta:
   Re-assessing implications for arterial patency and phylogenetic

Abstract = {Primate species typically differ from other mammals in having bony
   canals that enclose the branches of the internal carotid artery (ICA) as
   they pass through the middle ear. The presence and relative size of
   these canals varies among major primate clades. As a result, differences
   in the anatomy of the canals for the promontorial and stapedial branches
   of the ICA have been cited as evidence of either haplorhine or
   strepsirrhine affinities among otherwise enigmatic early fossil
   euprimates. Here we use micro X-ray computed tomography to compile the
   largest quantitative dataset on ICA canal sizes. The data suggest
   greater variation of the ICA canals within some groups than has been
   previously appreciated. For example, Lepilemur and Avahi differ from
   most other lemuriforms in having a larger promontorial canal than
   stapedial canal. Furthermore, various lemurids are intraspecifically
   variable in relative canal size, with the promontorial canal being
   larger than the stapedial canal in some individuals but not others. In
   species where the promontorial artery supplies the brain with blood, the
   size of the promontorial canal is significantly correlated with
   endocranial volume (ECV). Among species with alternate routes of
   encephalic blood supply, the promontorial canal is highly reduced
   relative to ECV, and correlated with both ECV and cranium size.
   Ancestral state reconstructions incorporating data from fossils suggest
   that the last common ancestor of living primates had promontorial and
   stapedial canals that were similar to each other in size and large
   relative to ECV. We conclude that the plesiomorphic condition for crown
   primates is to have a patent promontorial artery supplying the brain and
   a patent stapedial artery for various non encephalic structures. This
   inferred ancestral condition is exhibited by treeshrews and most early
   fossil euprimates, while extant primates exhibit reduction in one canal
   or another. The only early fossils deviating from this plesiomorphic
   condition are Adapis parisiensis with a reduced promontorial canal, and
   Rooneyia and Mahgarita with reduced stapedial canals. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {Patterns of Quadrupedal Locomotion in a Vertical Clinging and Leaping
   Primate (Propithecus coquereli) with Implications for Understanding the
   Functional Demands of Primate Quadrupedal Locomotion},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {160},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {644-652},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives: Many primates exhibit a suite of characteristics that
   distinguish their quadrupedal gaits from non-primate mammals including
   the use of a diagonal sequence gait, a relatively protracted humerus at
   touchdown, and relatively high peak vertical forces on the hindlimbs
   compared to the forelimbs. These characteristics are thought to have
   evolved together in early, small-bodied primates possibly in response to
   the mechanical demands of navigating and foraging in a complex arboreal
   environment. It remains unclear, however, whether primates that employ
   quad-rupedalism only rarely demonstrate the common primate pattern of
   quadrupedalism or instead use the common non-primate pattern or an
   entirely different mechanical pattern from either group.
   Materials and Methods: This study compared the kinematics and kinetics
   of two habitually quadrupedal primates (Lemur catta and Varecia
   variegata) to those of a dedicated vertical clinger and leaper
   (Propithecus coquereli) during bouts of quadrupedal walking.
   Results: All three species employed diagonal sequence gaits almost
   exclusively, displayed similar degrees of humeral protraction, and
   exhibited lower vertical peak forces in the forelimbs compared to the
   hindlimb.
   Discussion: From the data in this study, it is possible to reject the
   idea that P. coquereli uses a non-primate pattern of quadrupedal walking
   mechanics. Nor do they use an entirely different mechanical pattern from
   either most primates or most non-primates during quadrupedal locomotion.
   These findings provide support for the idea that this suite of
   characteristics is adaptive for the challenges of arboreal locomotion in
   primates and that these features of primate locomotion may be basal to
   the order or evolved independently in multiple lineages including
   indriids. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Title = {Population- and Individual-Level Dynamics of the Intestinal Microbiota
   of a Small Primate},
Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {82},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3537-3545},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Longitudinal sampling for intestinal microbiota in wild animals is
   difficult, leading to a lack of information on bacterial dynamics
   occurring in nature. We studied how the composition of microbiota
   communities changed temporally in free-ranging small primates, rufous
   mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus). We marked and recaptured mouse lemurs
   during their mating season in Ranomafana National Park in southeastern
   mountainous rainforests of Madagascar for 2 years and determined the
   fecal microbiota compositions of these mouse lemurs with MiSeq
   sequencing. We collected 160 fecal samples from 71 animals and had two
   or more samples from 39 individuals. We found small, but statistically
   significant, effects of site and age on microbiota richness and
   diversity and effects of sex, year, and site on microbiota composition,
   while the within-year temporal trends were less clear. Within-host
   microbiota showed pervasive variation in intestinal bacterial community
   composition, especially during the second study year. We hypothesize
   that the biological properties of mouse lemurs, including their small
   body size and fast metabolism, may contribute to the temporal
   intraindividual-level variation, something that should be testable with
   more-extensive sampling regimes.
   IMPORTANCE
   While microbiome research has blossomed in recent years, there is a lack
   of longitudinal studies on microbiome dynamics on free-ranging hosts. To
   fill this gap, we followed mouse lemurs, which are small heterothermic
   primates, for 2 years. Most studied animals have shown microbiota to be
   stable over the life span of host individuals, but some previous
   research also found ample within-host variation in microbiota
   composition. Our study used a larger sample size than previous studies
   and a study setting well suited to track within-host variation in
   free-ranging mammals. Despite the overall microbiota stability at the
   population level, the microbiota of individual mouse lemurs can show
   large-scale changes in composition in time periods as short as 2 days,
   suggesting caution in inferring individual-level patterns from
   population-level data.},

Title = {Infant Transport and Mother-Infant Contact From 1 to 26 Weeks Postnatal
   in Coquerel's Sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) in Northwestern Madagascar},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2016},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Lactating females face energetic constraints absent in conspecifics and
   must compensate for higher energy requirements. Infant transport is the
   most energetically costly mammalian activity after lactation.
   Nonetheless, infant transport and mother-infant contact are seldom
   measured. The extreme seasonality characteristic of Madagascar coupled
   with lactation costs and infant transport is a trifold energetic
   challenge encountered by lemur mothers. We hypothesized that Coquerel's
   sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) mothers spend more time caring for
   infants during the early/earlier-mid lactation period, coinciding with
   the resource depletive austral winter, relative to later-mid/late
   lactation. We tested this hypothesis by measuring infant carrier
   identity, transport position, and frequency of mother-infant contact for
   678 focal hours over two consecutive birth seasons from 1 to 26 weeks
   postnatal (N = 10 infants, N = 10 mothers, N = 19 adult males, N = 8
   adult females) in Ankarafantsika National Park (ANP), Madagascar.
   Quantifying P. coquereli postnatal care strategies demonstrates how a
   species with a ``slow{''} life history lives in an energetically
   challenging environment, thereby providing data on maternal energetic
   responses and infant development in an endangered strepsirrhine. Mothers
   were the primary infant transporters. Adult males and non-lactating
   females participated in infant transport, but for significantly less
   time. Infants spent significantly more time in the ventral transport
   position than dorsally or independently. Infants were still transported
   26\% of the time at 6.5 months postnatal. Infants initiated and broke
   bodily contact with mothers more frequently than mothers initiated and
   broke contact with infants. Infants were dependent on their mothers for
   longer durations than suggested by previous studies and carried dorsally
   until later ages than in other comparably sized wild lemurs. Am. J.

Title = {Body mass loss correlates with cognitive performance in primates under
   acute caloric restriction conditions.},
Journal = {BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {305},
Pages = {157-163},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Brain functions are known to consume high levels of energy, thus, the
   integrity of cognitive performance can be drastically impacted by acute
   caloric restriction. In this study, we tested the impact of a 40\%
   caloric restriction on the cognitive abilities of the grey mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus).
   Twenty-three male mouse lemurs were divided into two groups: 13 control
   animals (CTL) that were fed with 105 kJ/day and 10 calorie restricted
   (CR) animals that received 40\% less food (63 kJ/day) than the CTL
   animals. The animals were fed according to their group for 19 days.
   Before treatment, we assessed baseline associative learning capacities,
   resting metabolic rates and locomotor performance of both animal groups.
   After treatment, we tested the same functions as well as long-term
   memory.
   Our results showed that CR animals had lower learning performance
   following caloric restriction. The effects of caloric restriction on
   memory recall varied and depended on the metabolism of the individual
   animal. Body mass loss was linked to memory test performance in the CR
   group, and lower performance was observed in individuals losing the most
   weight. While CR was observed to negatively impact learning, locomotor
   capacities were preserved in CR animals, and there were higher resting
   metabolic rates in the CR group. Our data reinforce the strong link
   between energy allocation and brain function, and suggest that in the
   context of food shortage, learning capacities could be a limiting
   parameter in the adaptation to a changing environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   decomposing bark (deadwood), and 2) the seeds of Canarium trees.
   Aye-ayes have very large individual home ranges relative to most other
   lemurs, possibly owing to limited resource availability. Identification
   of limiting dietary factor(s) is critical for our understanding of
   aye-aye behavioral ecology and future conservation efforts. To
   investigate whether aye-ayes equally access all deadwood resources
   within their range, we surveyed two 100 x 100 m forest plots within the
   territories of two aye-ayes at Sangasanga, Kianjavato, Madagascar. Only
   2 of 150 deadwood specimens within the plots (1.3\%) appeared to have
   been accessed by the aye-ayes. To test whether any external or internal
   deadwood properties explain aye-aye foraging preferences we recorded
   species, height and diameter, and quantified the internal tree density
   using a 3D acoustic tomograph for each foraged and nonforaged deadwood
   resource within the plots, plus 13 specimens (5 foraged and 8
   nonforaged) outside the plots. We did not detect any statistically
   significant preferences for species, diameter, or height. However,
   results from the acoustic analysis tentatively indicated that aye-ayes
   are more likely to forage in trees with greater internal (a parts per
   thousand yen6 cm from the bark) densities. This interior region may
   function as a sounding board in the tap-foraging process to help
   aye-ayes accurately identify potential grub-containing cavities in the
   outer 1-4 cm of deadwood.},

Title = {Considering the Influence of Nonadaptive Evolution on Primate Color
   Vision},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {Color vision in primates is variable across species, and it represents a
   rare trait in which the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic
   variation are fairly well-understood. Research on primate color vision
   has largely focused on adaptive explanations for observed variation, but
   it remains unclear why some species have trichromatic or polymorphic
   color vision while others are red-green color blind. Lemurs, in
   particular, are highly variable. While some species are polymorphic,
   many closely-related species are strictly dichromatic. We provide the
   first characterization of color vision in a wild population of
   red-bellied lemurs (Eulemur rubriventer, Ranomafana National Park,
   Madagascar) with a sample size (87 individuals; N-X chromosomes = 134)
   large enough to detect even rare variants (0.95 probability of detection
   at >= 3\% frequency). By sequencing exon 5 of the X-linked opsin gene we
   identified opsin spectral sensitivity based on known diagnostic sites
   and found this population to be dichromatic and monomorphic for a long
   wavelength allele. Apparent fixation of this long allele is in contrast
   to previously published accounts of Eulemur species, which exhibit
   either polymorphic color vision or only the medium wavelength opsin.
   This unexpected result may represent loss of color vision variation,
   which could occur through selective processes and/or genetic drift (e.
   g., genetic bottleneck). To indirectly assess the latter scenario, we
   genotyped 55 adult red-bellied lemurs at seven variable microsatellite
   loci and used heterozygosity excess and M-ratio tests to assess if this
   population may have experienced a recent genetic bottleneck. Results of
   heterozygosity excess but not M-ratio tests suggest a bottleneck might
   have occurred in this red-bellied lemur population. Therefore, while
   selection may also play a role, the unique color vision observed in this
   population might have been influenced by a recent genetic bottleneck.
   These results emphasize the need to consider adaptive and nonadaptive
   mechanisms of color vision evolution in primates.},

Abstract = {The ultimate determinants of cathemerality, i.e., activity spread over
   the 24-h cycle, in primates have been linked to various ecological
   factors. Owing to the fast rate of habitat modification, it is
   imperative to know whether and how this behavioral flexibility responds
   to anthropogenic disturbance. The true lemurs (Eulemur clade) constitute
   a valuable case to study these potential effects, as all species studied
   so far exhibit cathemerality. Here we explored the effects of
   anthropogenic disturbance on activity patterns of Eulemur while
   controlling for ecological factors proposed as determinants of activity
   shifts. We first performed a meta-analysis using 13 long-term studies
   conducted over the last three decades on various populations of Eulemur.
   We fitted a beta regression using the proportion of diurnality (the
   activity taking place between sunrise and sunset) as the response
   variable and seven climatic, ecological, and anthropogenic disturbance
   variables at each site as predictors. We also present a validation with
   original data using year-round, 24-h activity of collared brown lemurs
   (Eulemur collaris) in forest fragments with different levels of
   disturbance in southeastern Madagascar. Diurnality was prevalent at most
   sites. Seasonality, proportions of leaves in the diet, and group size
   were all found to be significant predictors of the proportion of diurnal
   activity. After controlling for socioecological factors in the model,
   overall anthropogenic disturbance emerged as a negative predictor of
   diurnality. Our validation suggests that the lemurs in the more
   disturbed area exhibited more nocturnal activity than those in the less
   disturbed area. It is unclear whether the plasticity observed might
   allow populations of Eulemur to persist in disturbed areas longer than
   lemurs with less flexible activity patterns.},

Title = {Anthropogenic and Climatic Effects on the Distribution of Eulemur
   Species: An Ecological Niche Modeling Approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Several factors can influence primate distributions, including
   evolutionary history, interspecific competition, climate, and
   anthropogenic impacts. In Madagascar, several small spatial scale
   studies have shown that anthropogenic habitat modification affects the
   density and distribution of many lemur species. Ecological niche models
   can be used to examine broad-scale influences of anthropogenic impacts
   on primate distributions. In this study, we examine how climate and
   anthropogenic factors influence the distribution of 11 Eulemur species
   using ecological niche models. Specifically, we created one set of
   models only using rainfall and temperature variables. We then created a
   second set of models that combined these climate variables with three
   anthropogenic factors: distance to dense settlements, villages, and
   croplands. We used MaxEnt to generate all the models. We found that the
   addition of anthropogenic variables improved the climate models. Also,
   most Eulemur species exhibited reduced predicted geographic
   distributions once anthropogenic factors were added to the model.
   Distance to dense settlements was the most important anthropogenic
   factor in most cases. We suggest that including anthropogenic variables
   in ecological niche models is important for understanding primate
   distributions, especially in regions with significant human impacts. In
   addition, we identify several Eulemur species that were most affected by
   anthropogenic factors and should be the focus of increased conservation
   efforts.},

Pages = {10-28},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent comparative studies on the evolution of mammalian sociality came
   to opposite conclusions regarding the direction and drivers of
   evolutionary transitions in social organization, particularly concerning
   the evolution of pair-living among primates. Because the genus Eulemur
   is one of the few exceptional primate genera that contain both group-and
   pair-living species, eulemurs offer a rare opportunity to illuminate the
   processes driving social diversity among species with very similar life
   histories and ecologies. The aims of our study were therefore 1) to
   reconstruct the evolution of social organization in eulemurs with new
   demographic and phylogenetic data and 2) to evaluate several hypotheses
   about the evolution of pair-living with data from our long-term study of
   Eulemur rufifrons and published data on other eulemurs. Our review of
   published data confirmed that E. mongoz and E. rubriventer are
   pair-living, whereas the 10 other species of Eulemur live in groups with
   multiple adult males and females. Furthermore, pair-living evolved at
   least once among eulemurs from group-living ancestors. The available
   comparative evidence indicated that this evolutionary transition was
   probably not driven by male infanticide, social instability, or singular
   ecological factors. Instead, we propose that female competition has
   favored small female group size and that this effect may have been
   exacerbated by interspecific competition with sympatric congeners in the
   ancestors of the pair-living species. In conclusion, we confirmed that
   the evolution of pair-living from group-living ancestors among true
   lemurs is exceptional, but not unique, among mammals, and that commonly
   invoked hypotheses for the evolution of pair-living do not appear to be
   supported for this genus.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesLittle is known about the absolute pool of energy primates use
   in the wild and how this pool varies seasonally. It is also not fully
   understood why some species facing unpredictable changes in food supply
   and risks of energy imbalance show high breeding seasonality. We
   examined these issues in a folivorous gregarious lemur (Propithecus
   coronatus) in a dry forest of Madagascar.
   MethodsWe assessed energy input and activity budget in males and females
   from three groups during dry and wet months. Diet composition and daily
   food intake were determined using focal animal sampling and continuous
   recording of mouthfuls. Locomotion types and daily distances traveled
   were recorded. Time budget was determined using scan sampling,
   supplemented with a preliminary analysis of the energy budget using the
   factorial method.
   ResultsThe macronutrient composition of the diet did not change markedly
   between seasons but a large increase in energy input arose during the
   early wet season. Activity was highest at this period but entailed only
   moderate increase in energy expenditure. Females did not ingest more
   energy than males despite female dominance. Both sexes exhibited a
   thrifty energy strategy and, possibly, fat storage.
   ConclusionsSeasonal increase of daily energy input was likely related to
   male-male mating competition and females' need to reach physical
   condition prior to the dry season sufficient for reproducing. Sifakas
   may time their reproductive cycle according to the seasonal variation in
   day-length because recurrent patterns of low (dry season) versus high
   (wet season) food production occur despite years of food shortage. Am J

Abstract = {DNA quantity can be a hindrance in ecological and evolutionary research
   programmes due to a range of factors including endangered status of
   target organisms, available tissue type, and the impact of field
   conditions on preservation methods. A potential solution to low-quantity
   DNA lies in whole genome amplification (WGA) techniques that can
   substantially increase DNA yield. To date, few studies have rigorously
   examined sequence bias that might result from WGA and next-generation
   sequencing of nonmodel taxa. To address this knowledge deficit, we use
   multiple displacement amplification (MDA) and double-digest RAD
   sequencing on the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) to quantify bias
   in genome coverage and SNP calls when compared to raw genomic DNA
   (gDNA). We focus our efforts in providing baseline estimates of
   potential bias by following manufacturer's recommendations for starting
   DNA quantities (>100ng). Our results are strongly suggestive that MDA
   enrichment does not introduce systematic bias to genome
   characterization. SNP calling between samples when genotyping both
   de-novo and with a reference genome are highly congruent (>98\%) when
   specifying a minimum threshold of 20X stack depth to call genotypes.
   Relative genome coverage is also similar between MDA and gDNA, and
   allelic dropout is not observed. SNP concordance varies based on
   coverage threshold, with 95\% concordance reached at similar to 12X
   coverage genotyping de-novo and similar to 7X coverage genotyping with
   the reference genome. These results suggest that MDA may be a suitable
   solution for next-generation molecular ecological studies when DNA
   quantity would otherwise be a limiting factor.},

Abstract = {Although research on lemurid primates in Madagascar has been ongoing for
   several decades, reports on different drug regimes to immobilize wild
   lemurs are limited. This study compares the efficacy, reliability, and
   side effects of ketamine-xylazine, ketamine-xylazine-atropine, and
   tiletamine-zolazepam immobilization in wild Verreaux's sifakas
   (Propithecus verreauxi). In the course of a long-term study in Kirindy
   Forest, western Madagascar, eight animals each received a mixture of
   ketamine (5.32 +/- 1.71 mg/kg) and xylazine (0.56 +/- 0.19 mg/kg) (KX; 7
   males, 1 female) and ketamine (6.58 +/- 1.36 mg/kg), xylazine (1.28 +/-
   0.28 mg/kg), and atropine (0.013 +/- 0.003 mg/kg) (KXA; 5 males, 3
   females), respectively, and 14 individuals received tiletamine-zolazepam
   (7.73 +/- 1.37 mg/kg) (TZ; 9 males, 5 females). Induction was smooth in
   all protocols, but showed considerable variation in duration when
   animals had received KXA. Immobilization as well as recovery lasted
   significantly longer with TZ than with KX (P < 0.05). Occurrence of side
   effects was not significantly different between the protocols; however,
   excessive salivation, involuntary muscular contractions, and
   vocalization only occurred in animals immobilized with TZ. Heart rate
   measurement at 10 min after onset of complete immobilization yielded
   significantly higher values if the animals had been immobilized with TZ
   compared to KX (P < 0.05). Heart rate decreased from the first to the
   second measurement for the KX- and KXA-immobilized animals, whereas
   immobilization with TZ resulted in an increase in heart rate. The
   results suggest that KX produces good, but short, immobilization in
   Verreaux's sifakas at approximately 5 mg/kg ketamine and 0.5 mg/kg
   xylazine and a smoother and shorter recovery phase than 5 to 10 mg/kg
   TZ, whereas adding atropine to KX did not provide any benefits.},

Abstract = {Timing of winter phenotype expression determines individual chances of
   survival until the next reproductive season. Environmental cues
   triggering this seasonal phenotypic transition have rarely been
   investigated, although they play a central role in the compensation of
   climatic fluctuations via plastic phenotypic adjustments. Initiation of
   winter daily torpor use-a widespread energy-saving phenotype-could be
   primarily timed according to anticipatory seasonal cues (anticipatory
   cues hypothesis), or flexibly fine-tuned according to actual energy
   availability (food shortage hypothesis). We conducted a food
   supplementation experiment on wild heterothermic primates (grey mouse
   lemurs, Microcebus murinus) at the transition to the food-limited dry
   season, i.e. the austral winter. As expected under the food shortage
   hypothesis, food-supplemented individuals postponed the seasonal
   transition to normal torpor use by 1-2 month(s), spent four times less
   torpid, and exhibited minimal skin temperature 6 A degrees C higher than
   control animals. This study provides the first in situ experimental
   evidence that food availability, rather than abiotic cues, times the
   launching of torpor use. Fine-tuning of the timing of seasonal
   phenotypic transitions according to actual food shortage should provide
   heterotherms with a flexible adaptive mechanism to survive unexpected
   environmental fluctuations.},

Title = {The Nutritional Geometry of Resource Scarcity: Effects of Lean Seasons
   and Habitat Disturbance on Nutrient Intakes and Balancing in Wild
   Sifakas},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Animals experience spatial and temporal variation in food and nutrient
   supply, which may cause deviations from optimal nutrient intakes in both
   absolute amounts (meeting nutrient requirements) and proportions
   (nutrient balancing). Recent research has used the geometric framework
   for nutrition to obtain an improved understanding of how animals respond
   to these nutritional constraints, among them free-ranging primates
   including spider monkeys and gorillas. We used this framework to examine
   macronutrient intakes and nutrient balancing in sifakas (Propithecus
   diadema) at Tsinjoarivo, Madagascar, in order to quantify how these vary
   across seasons and across habitats with varying degrees of anthropogenic
   disturbance. Groups in intact habitat experience lean season decreases
   in frugivory, amounts of food ingested, and nutrient intakes, yet
   preserve remarkably constant proportions of dietary macronutrients, with
   the proportional contribution of protein to the diet being highly
   consistent. Sifakas in disturbed habitat resemble intact forest groups
   in the relative contribution of dietary macronutrients, but experience
   less seasonality: all groups' diets converge in the lean season, but
   disturbed forest groups largely fail to experience abundant season
   improvements in food intake or nutritional outcomes. These results
   suggest that: (1) lemurs experience seasonality by maintaining nutrient
   balance at the expense of calories ingested, which contrasts with
   earlier studies of spider monkeys and gorillas, (2) abundant season
   foods should be the target of habitat management, even though mortality
   might be concentrated in the lean season, and (3) primates' within-group
   competitive landscapes, which contribute to variation in social
   organization, may vary in complex ways across habitats and seasons.},

Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease causes severe cognitive alterations in humans and is
   associated with two main :pathologic processes: the beta-amyloid and tau
   pathologies. Imaging biomarkers can reveal the natural history of the
   disease and show an alteration of glucose metabolism and an evolving
   cerebral atrophy process. The discovery of new therapies against this
   disease relies on early stages of drug development that can be evaluated
   precisely only in animals. Our review focuses on transgenic mouse models
   of amyloidosis and on the mouse lemur primate model. Biomarkers in these
   animals may reveal endophenotypes that can be compared to human
   endophenotypes and help rationalizing decision-making during the
   development of new therapies. Animal models can also help to validate
   new hypotheses on disease mechanisms. We focus here on the protein
   misfolding hypothesis of Alzheimer as it will probably modulate our
   vision of the disease in forthcoming years. This hypothesis suggests
   that native A beta peptides become toxic when their conformation in
   alpha helices evolves into a beta-sheet conformation and also suggests
   that misfolded proteins can transmit their misfolded conformation to
   normal proteins.},

Title = {Electromyography of Crural and Pedal Muscles in Tufted Capuchin Monkeys
   (Sapajus apella): Implications for Hallucal Grasping Behavior and First
   Metatarsal Morphology in Euprimates},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {156},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {553-564},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A hypertrophied peroneal process of the hallucal metatarsal, as seen in
   prosimians, has been linked to a powerful hallucal grasp via the
   contraction of the peroneus longus (PL) muscle causing adduction of the
   big toe. Electromyography (EMG) studies of lemurs and lorises, however,
   have concluded that PL is not substantially recruited during small
   branch locomotion when powerful hallucal grasping is needed most, and
   have suggested that there is no link between PL activity and peroneal
   process size. If this is correct, then we should also observe no change
   in PL activity when strong hallucal grasping is required in anthropoids
   because they have a relatively smaller peroneal process for PL to act
   on. This study addresses this hypothesis by evaluating EMG of crural and
   pedal muscles in capuchins (Sapajus apella) walking on substrates of
   different diameters. During locomotion on the narrow substrate (3.1 cm)
   that should elicit a strong hallucal grasp, we observed an intense
   increased recruitment of adductor hallucis, but only sustained, rather
   than markedly increased, PL activity. This indicates that PL is not
   involved in powerful hallucal grasping in capuchins, and confirms
   similar findings previously documented in prosimians. We continue to
   reject the hypothesis that a large peroneal process is an adaptation for
   powerful grasping and further argue that its morphology may not be
   related to PL's ability to adduct the hallux at all. In addition, the
   morphology of the peroneal process should not be used to assess hallucal
   grasping performance in fossils. Am J Phys Anthropol 156:553-564, 2015.

Title = {Baby on board: olfactory cues indicate pregnancy and fetal sex in a
   non-human primate},
Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Olfactory cues play an integral, albeit underappreciated, role in
   mediating vertebrate social and reproductive behaviour. These cues
   fluctuate with the signaller's hormonal condition, coincident with and
   informative about relevant aspects of its reproductive state, such as
   pubertal onset, change in season and, in females, timing of ovulation.
   Although pregnancy dramatically alters a female's endocrine profiles,
   which can be further influenced by fetal sex, the relationship between
   gestation and olfactory cues is poorly understood. We therefore examined
   the effects of pregnancy and fetal sex on volatile genital secretions in
   the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), a strepsirrhine primate possessing
   complex olfactory mechanisms of reproductive signalling. While pregnant,
   dams altered and dampened their expression of volatile chemicals, with
   compound richness being particularly reduced in dams bearing sons. These
   changes were comparable in magnitude with other, published chemical
   differences among lemurs that are salient to conspecifics. Such
   olfactory `signatures' of pregnancy may help guide social interactions,
   potentially promoting mother-infant recognition, reducing intragroup
   conflict or counteracting behavioural mechanisms of paternity confusion;
   cues that also advertise fetal sex may additionally facilitate
   differential sex allocation.},

Abstract = {Muscle strength reflects physical functioning, declines at old age and
   predicts health and survival in humans and laboratory animals.
   Age-associated muscle deterioration causes loss of strength and may
   impair fitness of wild animals. However, the effects of age and
   life-history characteristics on muscle strength in wild animals are
   unknown. We investigated environment-and sex-specific patterns of
   physical functioning by measuring grip strength in wild and captive gray
   mouse lemurs. We expected more pronounced strength senescence in
   captivity due to condition-dependent, extrinsic mortality found in
   nature. Males were predicted to be stronger but potentially experience
   more severe senescence than females as predicted by life history theory.
   We found similar senescent declines in captive males and females as well
   as wild females, whereas wild males showed little decline, presumably
   due to their early mortality. Captive animals were generally weaker and
   showed earlier declines than wild animals. Unexpectedly, females tended
   to be stronger than males, especially in the reproductive season.
   Universal intrinsic mechanisms (e. g. sarcopenia) likely cause the
   similar patterns of strength loss across settings. The female advantage
   in muscle strength merits further study; it may follow higher
   reproductive investment by males, or be an adaptation associated with
   female social dominance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The energetics of a Malagasy rodent, Macrotarsomys ingens (Nesomyinae):

Abstract = {This study provides first insights into the energetics of the
   Nesomyinae, a subfamily of rodents endemic to Madagascar. The ancestral
   nesomyine colonized Madagascar from Africa ca. 30-15 mya at the onset of
   Oligocene global cooling. We tested the hypothesis that, contrary to
   what might be expected from Island Biogeography theory,
   post-colonization character displacement of thermoregulatory traits was
   constrained by phylogenetic inertia through climate adaptation. The
   study was conducted in the Parc National d'Ankarafantsika, Madagascar.
   We measured the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and body temperature (T (b))
   patterns of naturally warm-acclimated, freshly captured adult
   long-tailed big-footed mice Macrotarsomys ingens (67.4 g). The mean +/-
   A SD BMR of M. ingens was 0.298 +/- A 0.032 Watts (n = 12), 31.7 \%
   lower than that predicted by a phylogenetically independent allometric
   equation. Body mass was correlated with BMR. The lower critical limit of
   thermoneutrality (T (lc)) was 30.7 A degrees C. The mean +/- A SD T (b)
   = 36.1 +/- A 0.8 A degrees C (n = 12) compared well with the mean T (b)
   values for myomorph rodents from the Afrotropical zone, but was lower
   than those of the Neotropical and Palearctic zones. M. ingens became
   pathologically hypothermic when exposed to ambient temperatures lower
   than 18 A degrees C. The soil temperature at depths of 250 mm and deeper
   did not decrease below 22 A degrees C throughout the austral winter. The
   thermoregulatory data for M. ingens did not differ from those that
   characterize mainland Afrotropical rodents. However, BMR and T (b) were
   lower than those of Holarctic rodents. Thus, contrary to expectations of
   Island Biogeography theory that rapid character displacement often
   occurs in morphological and behavioural traits when mammals colonize
   islands, M. ingens displayed climate-related physiological traits
   indicative of phylogenetic inertia. Presumably the tropical conditions
   that prevailed on Madagascar at the time of colonisation differed very
   little from those of the African mainland, and hence there was no strong
   driving force for change. Unlike small tenrecs and lemurs that radiated
   on Madagascar prior to the Oligocene, traits associated with an insular
   existence, such as daily torpor and hibernation, were not evident in M.

Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing platforms are generating massive amounts of
   genomic data from nonmodel species, and these data sets are valuable
   resources that can be mined to advance a number of research areas. An
   example is the growing amount of transcriptome data that allow for
   examination of gene expression in nonmodel species. Here, we show how
   publicly available transcriptome data from nonmodel primates can be used
   to design novel research focused on immunogenomics. We mined
   transcriptome data from the world's most endangered group of primates,
   the lemurs of Madagascar, for sequences corresponding to
   immunoglobulins. Our results confirmed homology between strepsirrhine
   and haplorrhine primate immunoglobulins and allowed for high-throughput
   sequencing of expressed antibodies (Ig-seq) in Coquerel's sifaka
   (Propithecus coquereli). Using both Pacific Biosciences RS and Ion
   Torrent PGM sequencing, we performed Ig-seq on two individuals of
   Coquerel's sifaka. We generated over 150000 sequences of expressed
   antibodies, allowing for molecular characterization of the
   antigen-binding region. Our analyses suggest that similar VDJ expression
   patterns exist across all primates, with sequences closely related to
   the human V(H)3 immunoglobulin family being heavily represented in
   sifaka antibodies. Moreover, the antigen-binding region of sifaka
   antibodies exhibited similar amino acid variation with respect to
   haplorrhine primates. Our study represents the first attempt to
   characterize sequence diversity of the expressed antibody repertoire in
   a species of lemur. We anticipate that methods similar to ours will
   provide the framework for investigating the adaptive immune response in
   wild populations of other nonmodel organisms and can be used to advance
   the burgeoning field of eco-immunology.},

Abstract = {Classic theories of ageing consider extrinsic mortality (EM) a major
   factor in shaping longevity and ageing, yet most studies of functional
   ageing focus on species with low EM. This bias may cause overestimation
   of the influence of senescent declines in performance over
   condition-dependent mortality on demographic processes across taxa. To
   simultaneously investigate the roles of functional senescence (FS) and
   intrinsic, extrinsic and condition-dependent mortality in a species with
   a high predation risk in nature, we compared age trajectories of body
   mass (BM) in wild and captive grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus)
   using longitudinal data (853 individuals followed through adulthood). We
   found evidence of non-random mortality in both settings. In captivity,
   the oldest animals showed senescence in their ability to regain lost BM,
   whereas no evidence of FS was found in the wild. Overall, captive
   animals lived longer, but a reversed sex bias in lifespan was observed
   between wild and captive populations. We suggest that even moderately
   condition-dependent EM may lead to negligible FS in the wild. While high
   EM may act to reduce the average lifespan, this evolutionary process may
   be counteracted by the increased fitness of the long-lived, high-quality
   individuals.},

Title = {Habitat Degradation and Seasonality Affect Physiological Stress Levels
   of Eulemur collaris in Littoral Forest Fragments},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {The littoral forest on sandy soil is among the most threatened habitats
   in Madagascar and, as such, it represents a hot-spot within a
   conservation hot-spot. Assessing the health of the resident lemur fauna
   is not only critical for the long-term viability of these populations,
   but also necessary for the future re-habilitation of this unique
   habitat. Since the Endangered collared brown lemur, Eulemur collaris, is
   the largest seed disperser of the Malagasy south-eastern littoral forest
   its survival in this habitat is crucial. In this study we compared fecal
   glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) levels, a measure of physiological
   stress and potential early indicator of population health, between
   groups of collared brown lemurs living in a degraded forest fragment and
   groups occurring in a more preserved area. For this, we analysed 279
   fecal samples collected year-round from 4 groups of collared brown
   lemurs using a validated 11-oxoetiocholanolone enzyme immunoassay and
   tested if fGCM levels were influenced by reproductive stages,
   phenological seasons, sex, and habitat degradation. The lemurs living in
   the degraded forest had significantly higher fGCM levels than those
   living in the more preserved area. In particular, the highest fGCM
   levels were found during the mating season in all animals and in females
   during gestation in the degraded forest. Since mating and gestation are
   both occurring during the lean season in the littoral forest, these
   results likely reflect a combination of ecological and reproductive
   pressures. Our findings provide a clear indication that habitat
   degradation has additive effects to the challenges found in the natural
   habitat. Since increased stress hormone output may have long-term
   negative effects on population health and reproduction, our data
   emphasize the need for and may add to the development of effective
   conservation plans for the species.},

Title = {Competition for Food in a Solitarily Foraging Folivorous Primate
   (Lepilemur leucopus)?},

Volume = {76},

Abstract = {Group-living folivorous primates can experience competition for food,
   and feeding competition has also been documented for solitarily foraging
   gummivorous and omnivorous primates. However, little is known about the
   types and consequences of feeding competition in solitary folivorous
   foragers. We conducted this study in the spiny forest of Berenty
   Reserve, southern Madagascar, to characterize the competitive regime of
   the nocturnal solitarily foraging white-footed sportive lemur (Lepilemur
   leucopus), a species that lives in dispersed pairs. We analyzed 1,213 hr
   of behavioral observations recorded simultaneously for the male and
   female of each of seven social units and recorded seasonal changes in
   food availability over a complete annual cycle. Lepilemur leucopus
   exhibited low selectivity in its dietary choice and mainly included the
   most abundant plant species in its diet. Contrary to our predictions, we
   did not find evidence for increased rates of contest (i.e., displacement
   from food trees) or scramble competition (i.e., shared use of food
   patches) during the lean season, neither within nor between social
   units. Instead, conflict rates were low throughout the year, and, during
   these observations, any feeding stress may have been more related to
   food quality than quantity. The resource defense hypotheses may not
   explain pair-living in this species as there was no indication that
   males defend food resources for their female pair-partners. The observed
   lack of feeding competition may indicate that a cryptic anti-predator
   strategy is a better predictor of spatial avoidance of pair-partners
   than conflict over food. While anti-predator benefits of crypsis may
   explain, at least partly, female-female avoidance, studies on the
   relationship between territory size/quality and reproductive success are
   required to understand whether feeding competition reduces the potential
   for female association in L. leucopus. (C) 2014 The Authors. American

Title = {The utility of PacBio circular consensus sequencing for characterizing
   complex gene families in non-model organisms},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Background: Molecular characterization of highly diverse gene families
   can be time consuming, expensive, and difficult, especially when
   considering the potential for relatively large numbers of paralogs
   and/or pseudogenes. Here we investigate the utility of Pacific
   Biosciences single molecule real-time (SMRT) circular consensus
   sequencing (CCS) as an alternative to traditional cloning and Sanger
   sequencing PCR amplicons for gene family characterization. We target
   vomeronasal gene receptors, one of the most diverse gene families in
   mammals, with the goal of better understanding intra-specific V1R
   diversity of the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). Our study
   compares intragenomic variation for two V1R subfamilies found in the
   mouse lemur. Specifically, we compare gene copy variation within and
   between two individuals of M. murinus as characterized by different
   methods for nucleotide sequencing. By including the same individual
   animal from which the M. murinus draft genome was derived, we are able
   to cross-validate gene copy estimates from Sanger sequencing versus CCS
   methods.
   Results: We generated 34,088 high quality circular consensus sequences
   of two diverse V1R subfamilies (here referred to as V1RI and V1RIX) from
   two individuals of Microcebus murinus. Using a minimum threshold of 7x
   coverage, we recovered approximately 90\% of V1RI sequences previously
   identified in the draft M. murinus genome (59\% being identical at all
   nucleotide positions). When low coverage sequences were considered (i.e.
   < 7x coverage) 100\% of V1RI sequences identified in the draft genome
   were recovered. At least 13 putatively novel V1R loci were also
   identified using CCS technology.
   Conclusions: Recent upgrades to the Pacific Biosciences RS instrument
   have improved the CCS technology and offer an alternative to traditional
   sequencing approaches. Our results suggest that the Microcebus murinus
   V1R repertoire has been underestimated in the draft genome. In addition
   to providing an improved understanding of V1R diversity in the mouse
   lemur, this study demonstrates the utility of CCS technology for
   characterizing complex regions of the genome. We anticipate that
   long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio SMRT will allow for the
   assembly of multigene family clusters and serve to more accurately
   characterize patterns of gene copy variation in large gene families,
   thus revealing novel micro-evolutionary patterns within non-model
   organisms.},

Title = {Shallow hypothermia depends on the level of fatty acid unsaturation in
   adipose and liver tissues in a tropical heterothermic primate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {43},
Pages = {81-88},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Optimal levels of unsaturated fatty acids have positive impacts on the
   use of prolonged bouts of hypothermia in mammalian hibernators, which
   generally have to face low winter ambient temperatures. Unsaturated
   fatty acids can maintain the fluidity of fat and membrane phospholipids
   at low body temperatures. However, less attention has been paid to their
   role in the regulation of shallow hypothermia, and in tropical species,
   which may be challenged more by seasonal energetic and/or water
   shortages than by low temperatures. The present study assessed the
   relationship between the fatty acids content of white adipose and liver
   tissues and the expression of shallow hypothermia in a tropical
   heterothermic primate, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). The
   adipose tissue is the main tissue for fat storage and the liver is
   involved in lipid metabolism, so both tissues were expected to influence
   hypothermia dependence on fatty acids. As mouse lemurs largely avoid
   deep hypothermia (i.e. torpor) use under standard captive conditions,
   the expression of hypothermia was triggered by food-restricting
   experimental animals. Hypothermia depth increased with time, with a
   stronger increase for individuals that exhibited higher contents of
   unsaturated fatty acids suggesting that they were more flexible in their
   use of hypothermia. However these same animals delayed the use of long
   hypothermia bouts relative to individuals with a higher level of
   saturated fatty acids. This study evidences for the first time that body
   fatty acids unsaturation levels influence the regulation of body
   temperature not only in cold-exposed hibernators but also in tropical,
   facultative heterotherms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Flexible patterns in energy savings: heterothermy in primates},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {292},
Number = {2},
Pages = {101-111},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Heterothermy is an energy-saving strategy usually employed in response
   to environmental bottlenecks, which is common in almost all mammalian
   orders. Within the order primates, heterothermy has been physiologically
   confirmed only in the family Cheirogaleidae (Cheirogaleus, Microcebus,
   Allocebus, Mirza) of the Malagasy lemurs, and the southern lesser
   bushbaby (Galago moholi) of the family Galagonidae. These closely
   related species employ a spectrum of daily torpor, prolonged torpor and
   obligate hibernation under tropical, but nevertheless seasonal and
   energetically demanding conditions. There is a remarkable physiological
   flexibility in regard to their thermoregulatory adaptations not only
   between species of the same genera within one habitat, but also between
   populations of the same species, within populations and even within the
   same individual, permitting immediate responses in seasonal and
   unpredictable environments, and possibly aiding these species to master
   challenges of globally changing climatic conditions. Whereas
   heterothermy is a flexible, but regular seasonal response in the
   Cheirogaleidae, it is only used as a last emergency strategy in
   G.moholi. In the other primate species, there is either no or only
   anecdotal evidence of only minor reductions in metabolic rate,
   presumably rather reflecting pronounced circadian cycles in body
   temperature, or local heterothermy. Maybe because of their relatively
   high degree of sociality and larger body sizes, behavioural and
   ecological adaptations to seasonality are selected for in other
   primates.},

Title = {Fibre type composition in the lumbar perivertebral muscles of primates:
   implications for the evolution of orthogrady in hominoids},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANATOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {224},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The axial musculoskeletal system is important for the static and dynamic
   control of the body during both locomotor and non-locomotor behaviour.
   As a consequence, major evolutionary changes in the positional habits of
   a species are reflected by morpho-functional adaptations of the axial
   system. Because of the remarkable phenotypic plasticity of muscle
   tissue, a close relationship exists between muscle morphology and
   function. One way to explore major evolutionary transitions in muscle
   function is therefore by comparative analysis of fibre type composition.
   In this study, the three-dimensional distribution of slow and fast
   muscle fibres was analysed in the lumbar perivertebral muscles of two
   lemuriform (mouse lemur, brown lemur) and four hominoid primate species
   (white-handed gibbon, orangutan, bonobo, chimpanzee) in order to develop
   a plausible scenario for the evolution of the contractile properties of
   the axial muscles in hominoids and to discern possible changes in muscle
   physiology that were associated with the evolution of orthogrady.
   Similar to all previously studied quadrupedal mammals, the lemuriform
   primates in this study exhibited a morpho-functional dichotomy between
   deep slow contracting local stabilizer muscles and superficial fast
   contracting global mobilizers and stabilizers and thus retained the
   fibre distribution pattern typical for quadrupedal non-primates. In
   contrast, the hominoid primates showed no regionalization of the fibre
   types, similar to previous observations in Homo. We suggest that this
   homogeneous fibre composition is associated with the high functional
   versatility of the axial musculature that was brought about by the
   evolution of orthograde behaviours and reflects the broad range of
   mechanical demands acting on the trunk in orthograde hominoids. Because
   orthogrady is a derived character of euhominoids, the uniform fibre type
   distribution is hypothesized to coincide with the evolution of
   orthograde behaviours.},

Abstract = {There is some urgency in the necessity to incorporate physiological data
   into mechanistic, trait-based, demographic climate change models.
   Physiological responses at the individual level provide the mechanistic
   link between environmental changes and individual performances and hence
   population dynamics. Here we consider the causal relationship between
   ambient temperature (T-a) and metabolic rate (MR), namely, the Arrhenius
   effect, which is directly affected by global warming through increases
   in average global air temperatures and the increase in the frequency and
   intensity of extreme climate events. We measured and collated data for
   several small, free-ranging tropical arboreal mammals and evaluated
   their vulnerability to Arrhenius effects and putative heat stress
   associated with climate change. Skin temperatures (T-skin) were obtained
   from free-ranging tarsiers (Tarsius syrichta) on Bohol Island,
   Philippines. Core body temperature (T-b) was obtained from the greater
   hedgehog tenrec (Setifer setosus) and the gray brown mouse lemur
   (Microcebus ravelobensis) from Ankarafantsika, Madagascar. T-skin for
   another mouse lemur, Microcebus griseorufus, was obtained from the
   literature. All four species showed evidence of hyperthermia during the
   daytime rest phase in the form of either T-skin or T-b that was higher
   than the normothermic T-b during the nighttime active phase.
   Potentially, tropical arboreal mammals with the lowest MRs and T-b, such
   as tarsiers, are the most vulnerable to sustained heat stress because
   their T-b is already close to T-a. Climate change may involve increases
   in MRs due to Arrhenius effects, especially during the rest phase or
   during torpor and hibernation. The most likely outcome of increased
   Arrhenius effects with climate change will be an increase in energy
   expenditure at the expense of other critical functions such as
   reproduction or growth and will thus affect fitness. However, we propose
   that these hypothetical Arrhenius costs can be, and in some species
   probably are, offset by the use of hyperthermic daily torpor, that is,
   hypometabolism at high T-a.},

Title = {Victims of Infanticide and Conspecific Bite Wounding in a
   Female-Dominant Primate: A Long-Term Study},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 18},
Abstract = {The aggression animals receive from conspecifics varies between
   individuals across their lifetime. As poignantly evidenced by
   infanticide, for example, aggression can have dramatic fitness
   consequences. Nevertheless, we understand little about the sources of
   variation in received aggression, particularly in females. Using a
   female-dominant species renowned for aggressivity in both sexes, we
   tested for potential social, demographic, and genetic patterns in the
   frequency with which animals were wounded by conspecifics. Our study
   included 243 captive, ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta), followed from
   infancy to adulthood over a 35-year time span. We extracted injury,
   social, and life-history information from colony records and calculated
   neutral heterozygosity for a subset of animals, as an estimate of
   genetic diversity. Focusing on victims rather than aggressors, we used
   General Linear Models to explain bite-wound patterns at different life
   stages. In infancy, maternal age best predicted wounds received, as
   infants born to young mothers were the most frequent infanticide
   victims. In adulthood, sex best predicted wounds received, as males were
   three times more likely than females to be seriously injured. No
   relation emerged between wounds received and the other variables
   studied. Beyond the generally expected costs of adult male intrasexual
   aggression, we suggest possible additive costs associated with
   female-dominant societies - those suffered by young mothers engaged in
   aggressive disputes and those suffered by adult males aggressively
   targeted by both sexes. We propose that infanticide in lemurs may be a
   costly by-product of aggressively mediated, female social dominance.
   Accordingly, the benefits of female behavioral `masculinization' accrued
   to females through priority of access to resources, may be partially
   offset by early costs in reproductive success. Understanding the factors
   that influence lifetime patterns of conspecific wounding is critical to
   evaluating the fitness costs associated with social living; however,
   these costs may vary substantially between societies.},

Title = {Beware of Primate Life History Data: A Plea for Data Standards and a
   Repository},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Life history variables such as the age at first reproduction and the
   interval between consecutive births are measures of investment in growth
   and reproduction in a particular population or species. As such they
   allow for meaningful comparisons of the speed of growth and reproduction
   between species and between larger taxa. Especially in primates such
   life history research has far reaching implications and has led for
   instance to the ``grandmother hypothesis{''}. Other links have been
   proposed with respect to dietary adaptations: Because protein is
   essential for growth and one of the primary sources of protein, leaves,
   occurs much less seasonally than fruits, it has been predicted that
   folivorous primates should grow faster compared to frugivorous ones.
   However, when comparing folivorous Asian colobines with frugivorous
   Asian macaques we recently documented a longer, instead of a shorter
   gestation length in folivores while age at first reproduction and
   interbirth interval did not differ. This supports earlier findings for
   Malagasy lemurs in which all life history variables tested were
   significantly longer in folivores compared to frugivores. Wondering why
   these trends were not apparent sooner, we tried to reconstruct our
   results for Asian primates with data from four popular life history
   compilations. However, this attempt failed; even the basic, allometric
   relationship with adult female body mass that is typical for life
   history variables could not be recovered. This negative result hints at
   severe problems with data quality. Here we show that data quality can be
   improved significantly by standardizing the variables and by controlling
   for factors such as nutritional conditions or infant mortality. Ideally,
   in the future, revised primate life history data should be collated in a
   central database accessible to everybody. In the long run such an
   initiative should be expanded to include all mammalian species.},

Title = {Individual flexibility in energy saving: body size and condition
   constrain torpor use},
Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {793-799},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Phenotypic flexibility is a major mechanism in compensating
   climate-driven changes in resource availability. Heterotherms can use
   daily torpor to overcome resource shortages and adverse environmental
   conditions. The expression of this adaptive energy-saving strategy
   varies among individuals, but the factors constraining individual
   flexibility remain largely unknown. As energy availability depends on
   individual stores and/or on the ability to acquire food, the propensity
   and flexibility in torpor use are expected to be constrained by body
   condition and/or size, respectively. The aim of this study was to test
   whether the dependency of torpor depth on air temperature was
   constrained by body condition and/or body size in a small heterothermic
   primate, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). During the onset of
   the dry season, we monitored air temperature as well as skin
   temperatures of 14 free-ranging individuals (12 females, two males) of
   known body mass and size. Unexpectedly, torpor depth depended as much on
   air temperature as on body condition and size. Fatter, or larger, mouse
   lemurs underwent deeper torpor than smaller, or leaner, ones. Individual
   reaction norms of torpor depth to air temperature also revealed that the
   propensity to undergo deep torpor and the flexibility in torpor depth
   were enhanced by large body size and high body condition, whereas small,
   lean individuals remained normothermic. Our study illustrates that
   alternative physiological strategies to overcome temperature constraints
   co-occur in a population, with body size and condition being key
   determinants of the energy conservation strategy that an individual can
   launch.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL E},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {36},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrated that interarticular coordination of
   terrestrial tetrapods emerges from an environment highly constrained by
   friction and the gravitational field. We briefly review recent works on
   the jumping behavior in squamates, lemurs and amphibians. We then
   explore previously published work as well as some unpublished
   experimental data on human jumping. Finally, we end by inferring
   locomotion in some of the first limbed vertebrates using a simulation
   procedure. All these data show that despite changes in shape, structure,
   and motor controls of taxa, the same spatio-temporal sequence of joint
   displacements always occurs when the movement is executed in a
   terrestrial environment. Comparison with aquatic locomotion argues for
   the hypothesis that this pattern emerged in early terrestrial tetrapods
   as a response to the gravitational constraint and the terrestrial
   frictional environment.},

Abstract = {We performed a population genomics study of the aye-aye, a highly
   specialized nocturnal lemur from Madagascar. Aye-ayes have low
   population densities and extensive range requirements that could make
   this flagship species particularly susceptible to extinction. Therefore,
   knowledge of genetic diversity and differentiation among aye-aye
   populations is critical for conservation planning. Such information may
   also advance our general understanding of Malagasy biogeography, as
   aye-ayes have the largest species distribution of any lemur. We
   generated and analyzed whole-genome sequence data for 12 aye-ayes from
   three regions of Madagascar (North, West, and East). We found that the
   North population is genetically distinct, with strong differentiation
   from other aye-ayes over relatively short geographic distances. For
   comparison, the average F-ST value between the North and East aye-aye
   populations separated by only 248 km-is over 2.1-times greater than that
   observed between human Africans and Europeans. This finding is
   consistent with prior watershed- and climate-based hypotheses of a
   center of endemism in northern Madagascar. Taken together, these results
   suggest a strong and long-term biogeographical barrier to gene flow.
   Thus, the specific attention that should be directed toward preserving
   large, contiguous aye-aye habitats in northern Madagascar may also
   benefit the conservation of other distinct taxonomic units. To help
   facilitate future ecological- and conservation-motivated population
   genomic analyses by noncomputational biologists, the analytical toolkit
   used in this study is available on the Galaxy Web site.},

Abstract = {Social animals have to coordinate joint movements to maintain group
   cohesion, but the latter is often compromised by diverging individual
   interests. A widespread behavioral mechanism to achieve coordination
   relies on shared or unshared consensus decision-making. If consensus
   costs are high, group fission represents an alternative tactic.
   Exploring determinants and outcomes of spontaneous group decisions and
   coordination of free-ranging animals is methodologically challenging. We
   therefore conducted a foraging experiment with a group of wild
   redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) to study decision outcomes,
   coordination of movements, individual foraging benefits and social
   interactions in response to the presentation of drinking platforms with
   varying baiting patterns. Behavioral observations were complemented with
   data from recordings of motion detector cameras installed at the
   platforms. The animal's behavior in the experimental conditions was
   compared to natural group movements. We could not determine the type of
   consensus decision-making because the group visited platforms randomly.
   The group fissioned during 23.3\% of platform visits, and fissioning
   resulted in more individuals drinking simultaneously. As under natural
   conditions, adult females initiated most group movements, but overtaking
   by individuals of different age and sex classes occurred in 67\% of
   movements to platforms, compared to only 18\% during other movements. As
   a result, individual resource intake at the platforms did not depend on
   departure position, age or sex, but on arrival order. Aggression at the
   platforms did not affect resource intake, presumably due to low
   supplanting rates. Our findings highlight the diversity of coordination
   processes and related consequences for individual foraging benefits in a
   primate group living under natural conditions.},

Title = {Extinctions, traits and phylogenetic community structure: insights from

Abstract = {Understanding the origin and maintenance of community composition
   through ecological and evolutionary time has been a central challenge in
   ecology. However little is known about how extinction may alter patterns
   of phylogenetic and phenotypic structure within communities. To address
   this, we used past and present primate communities in Madagascar as our
   model system to explore how a large extinction event within a taxon may
   alter evolutionary relationships and phenotypic distributions within
   communities. We also explored the influence of environment on the
   structure of present-day lemur communities. We found a phylogenetic
   pattern of overdispersion in both past and present-day communities.
   However, trait structures, including relative dispersion of body masses
   and trophic niches were altered following extinction. We posit that the
   overdispersed phylogenetic patterns have resulted from the unique
   ecological and evolutionary history of Madagascar's primates including a
   rapid adaptive radiation in the presence of a broad niche-space
   available during colonization. Differences in trait structures between
   present and past primate communities may be reflective of the selective
   extinction process that eliminated the largest primates from the island.
   Habitat also appeared to influence the structure of present-day lemur
   communities. Lower divergence in patterns of phylogeny, body mass and
   activity rhythms were found in dry relative to wet habitats. This may be
   due to potential advantages of being small and nocturnal in environments
   with low productivity and hot dry climates. We suggest current studies
   exploring community processes should consider potential effects of past
   extinction events. Such work is important for understanding community
   assembly, coexistence, and mechanisms driving extinctions, particularly
   given the current extinction crisis facing ecosystems globally.},

Abstract = {Caloric restriction in primates: how efficient as an anti-aging
   approach? Caloric restriction (CR) is the only non-genetic intervention
   known to date to slow the onset of age-related diseases and increase
   average and maximum lifespan in several species. Its interest is
   continually growing, particularly for the identification of mechanisms
   involved in increasing longevity. Unlike studies in invertebrate and
   rodent models have provided some indication about the mechanisms of the
   CR, the efficacy of CR as an anti-aging protocol in primates has not yet
   been fully established. In this review we present the advantages of
   using non human primates as relevant models to the study of human aging
   in general and specifically in the context of therapeutic interventions
   applicable to humans, such as CR. Through the longitudinal findings in
   the Grey Mouse Lemur (Microcebus marinas), we stress the importance of
   primate studies in the context of research on aging and their potential
   to advance the development of molecules which can mimic the beneficial
   effects of CR, already observed in some species, without imposing a
   reduced calorie diet.},

Title = {Molar size and diet in the Strepsirrhini: Implications for
   size-adjustment in studies of primate dental adaptation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {63},
Number = {6},
Pages = {796-804},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Among the Strepsirrhini, molar size does not exhibit a consistent
   dietary signal when body mass is used to size-adjust molar dimensions.
   This observation is also true for anthropoid primates, but when
   postcanine size is expressed relative to the size of the facial skeleton
   in this clade, folivorous anthropoids tend to have relatively larger
   postcanine teeth than anthropoids in other dietary categories. The
   contrast in the results generated by these two independent size
   variables appears to be related to systematic differences in facial size
   in the Anthropoidea, particularly between short-faced colobines and
   long-faced cercopithecines. The goal of this study was to determine
   whether a similar pattern of relationships characterizes strepsirrhines.
   Data on molar area, facial size, body mass, and diet for forty-three
   extant strepsirrhines and seven subfossil lemurs were analyzed using
   phylogenetic generalized least squares. Results indicate that
   strepsirrhine folivores tend to have larger molars than frugivores
   relative to the size of the facial skeleton. Insectivorous species
   exhibit a wide range of variation in relative molar size that appears to
   be taxonomically patterned: lorisids in this dietary category resemble
   folivores, whereas galagids resemble frugivores. These results confirm
   the generality of the anthropoid pattern and support the idea that, in
   some contexts, it may be useful to consider elements of the masticatory
   system relative to their functional and developmental environments
   rather than to overall organismal size. The biological significance of
   having large postcanine teeth relative to the size of the face, but not
   body mass, is discussed with reference to a model that identifies the
   size of the oral cavity as the most functionally relevant standard for
   assessing the relative size of the postcanine dentition. (C) 2012

Title = {Paternal kin recognition in the high frequency/ultrasonic range in a
   solitary foraging mammal},
Journal = {BMC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {Background: Kin selection is a driving force in the evolution of
   mammalian social complexity. Recognition of paternal kin using
   vocalizations occurs in taxa with cohesive, complex social groups. This
   is the first investigation of paternal kin recognition via vocalizations
   in a small-brained, solitary foraging mammal, the grey mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus), a frequent model for ancestral primates. We
   analyzed the high frequency/ultrasonic male advertisement (courtship)
   call and alarm call.
   Results: Multi-parametric analyses of the calls' acoustic parameters and
   discriminant function analyses showed that advertisement calls, but not
   alarm calls, contain patrilineal signatures. Playback experiments
   controlling for familiarity showed that females paid more attention to
   advertisement calls from unrelated males than from their fathers.
   Reactions to alarm calls from unrelated males and fathers did not
   differ.
   Conclusions: 1) Findings provide the first evidence of paternal kin
   recognition via vocalizations in a small-brained, solitarily foraging
   mammal. 2) High predation, small body size, and dispersed social systems
   may select for acoustic paternal kin recognition in the high
   frequency/ultrasonic ranges, thus limiting risks of inbreeding and
   eavesdropping by predators or conspecific competitors. 3) Paternal kin
   recognition via vocalizations in mammals is not dependent upon a large
   brain and high social complexity, but may already have been an integral
   part of the dispersed social networks from which more complex, kin-based
   sociality emerged.},

Title = {Infant parking and nesting, not allomaternal care, influence Malagasy
   primate life histories},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {66},
Number = {10},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Allomaternal care is a rare, though phylogenetically widespread,
   mammalian infant care strategy. Among primates, the effects of
   allomaternal care are marked; its presence correlates with faster infant
   growth, younger age at weaning, and shorter interbirth intervals. Recent
   comparative research has found that such fertility benefits are absent
   in other mammals and are thus unique to primates. In large part because
   data describing lemur allomaternal care were lacking, the reproductive
   advantages of allomaternal care have never been demonstrated in Malagasy
   strepsirrhines. Using newly available data and rigorous phylogenetic
   methods, we extend this hypothesis to strepsirrhines and test whether
   allomaternal care in lemurs confers similar maternal reproductive
   benefits. Contrary to expectations, the presence of allomaternal care
   did not significantly impact lemur reproductive output; we did not find
   relationships between allomaternal care and either fetal or postnatal
   growth rates or interbirth intervals. Rather, infant parking and
   nesting, strategies employed primarily by litter-bearing species, were
   positively associated with faster fetal and postnatal infant growth,
   while nesting was negatively associated with interbirth interval. Thus,
   although each form of haplorrhine allomaternal care is also observed in
   Malagasy primates, the effects that these behaviors have on female
   reproductive output more closely resemble nonprimate mammals. We suggest
   that Malagasy strepsirrhines may not equally benefit from allomaternal
   care compared to haplorrhines because reproductive rates are less
   flexible and allomaternal care may instead increase infant survival in
   Madagascar's harsh and unpredictable environment. Our study has
   significant implications for understanding the evolution of infant care
   and developmental trajectories in mammals.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3, S},
Pages = {S6-S18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Excessive burden of iron, or iron storage disease (ISD), has been
   reported in a large variety of captive mammal species, including
   browsing rhinoceroses; tapirs; fruit bats; lemurs; marmosets and some
   other primates; sugar gliders; hyraxes; some rodents and lagomorphs;
   dolphins; and some carnivores; including procyonids and pinnipeds. This
   report collates the comparative evidence for species' susceptibility,
   recognizing that the data for mammal species are limited. Differences
   reported in the occurrence of ISD between facilities, or within
   facilities over periods that span management changes, have been reported
   in individual cases but are underused in ISD research. Given the species
   composition, the hypothesis that evolutionary adaptations to the iron
   content and availability in the natural diet determine a species'
   susceptibility to ISD (in the face of deviating iron content and
   availability in diets offered in captivity) seems plausible in many
   cases. But exceptions, and additional species putatively susceptible
   based on this rationale, should be investigated. Whereas screening for
   ISD should be routine in zoo animal necropsy, screening of live
   individuals may be implemented for valuable species, to decide on
   therapeutic measures such as chelator application or phlebotomy.
   Whatever the reasons for LSD susceptibility, reducing dietary iron
   levels to maintenance requirements of the species in question seems to
   be a logical, preventive measure.},

Title = {Reproductive Resilience to Food Shortage in a Small Heterothermic
   Primate},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 25},
Abstract = {The massive energetic costs entailed by reproduction in most mammalian
   females may increase the vulnerability of reproductive success to food
   shortage. Unexpected events of unfavorable climatic conditions are
   expected to rise in frequency and intensity as climate changes. The
   extent to which physiological flexibility allows organisms to maintain
   reproductive output constant despite energetic bottlenecks has been
   poorly investigated. In mammals, reproductive resilience is predicted to
   be maximal during early stages of reproduction, due to the moderate
   energetic costs of ovulation and gestation relative to lactation. We
   experimentally tested the consequences of chronic-moderate and
   short-acute food shortages on the reproductive output of a small
   seasonally breeding primate, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus)
   under thermo-neutral conditions. These two food treatments were
   respectively designed to simulate the energetic constraints imposed by a
   lean year (40\% caloric restriction over eight months) or by a sudden,
   severe climatic event occurring shortly before reproduction (80\%
   caloric restriction over a month). Grey mouse lemurs evolved under the
   harsh, unpredictable climate of the dry forest of Madagascar and should
   thus display great potential for physiological adjustments to energetic
   bottlenecks. We assessed the resilience of the early stages of
   reproduction (mating success, fertility, and gestation) to these
   contrasted food treatments, and on the later stages (lactation and
   offspring growth) in response to the chronic food shortage only. Food
   deprived mouse lemurs managed to maintain constant most reproductive
   parameters, including oestrus timing, estrogenization level at oestrus,
   mating success, litter size, and litter mass as well as their overall
   number of surviving offspring at weaning. However, offspring growth was
   delayed in food restricted mothers. These results suggest that
   heterothermic, fattening-prone mammals display important reproductive
   resilience to energetic bottlenecks. More generally, species living in
   variable and unpredictable habitats may have evolved a flexible
   reproductive physiology that helps buffer environmental fluctuations.},

Title = {Leading Ladies: Leadership of Group Movements in a Pair-Living,
   Co-Dominant, Monomorphic Primate Across Reproductive Stages and Fruit
   Availability Seasons},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {74},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {For gregarious species, individuals must maintain cohesion while
   minimizing the costs of coordinated travel. Leaders of group movements
   potentially influence energy expenditure, energy intake, and predation
   risk for individuals in the group, which can have important fitness
   consequences. Models of pair-living species predict that energetic
   asymmetries lead to an emergent leader, with those in greater need
   leading. We investigated sex differences in leadership in pairs of
   red-bellied lemurs, Eulemur rubriventer, a monomorphic species with
   bisexual dispersal and no discernible hierarchy, to determine whether
   higher energetic requirements by adult females lead to female
   leadership. We collected leadership data in Ranomafana National Park,
   Madagascar on six groups of habituated E. rubriventer for 13 consecutive
   months between 20042005. To determine whether females led group
   movements more than males, we examined the difference in leadership
   frequencies of progressions in adult males and adult females within each
   group (n = 1,346 progressions). We further investigated the behavioral
   context (i.e. travel followed by feeding or not) and seasonal contexts
   (fruit availability, reproduction) of leadership. Group leadership was
   distributed, with different individuals leading the group at different
   times. However, females led significantly more than males, a pattern
   which was consistent in both feeding and non-feeding contexts and
   throughout all fruiting seasons and reproductive stages. While
   disparities in energetic status among the sexes may impact leadership in
   this species, leadership did not differ with changes in food
   availability or reproductive stage, and thus we were unable to determine
   whether female leadership might be related to changes in energetic
   status. Females may have higher energetic needs than males at all times,
   not merely seasonally, or female leadership may be unrelated to
   immediate energetic need. Rather, female leadership may be a legacy of
   female dominance not currently expressed in other contexts. Am. J.

Volume = {33},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {In humans, but not in nonhuman primates, a clear relationship has been
   established between age-associated cognitive decline and atrophy of
   specific brain regions. We evaluated age-related cerebral atrophy and
   cognitive alterations in mouse lemur primates. Cerebral atrophy was
   evaluated by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging in 34 animals aged from
   1.9 to 11.8 years. The caudate and splenium were atrophied in most older
   animals, whereas shrinkage of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and
   septal region was identified in a subgroup of the older animals. The
   temporal and cingulate cortex also exhibited a severe atrophy, whereas
   frontal and parietal areas were spared. Measures of cognitive ability in
   16 animals studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that both
   executive functions and spatial memory declined with aging. Impairment
   of executive functions in older animals was associated with atrophy of
   the septal region while spatial memory performance was related to
   atrophy of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Mouse lemurs are the
   first nonhuman primates in which a clear relationship is established
   between age-associated cognitive alteration and cerebral atrophy. (C)

Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {180-189},

Abstract = {Analysing behavioural sequences and quantifying the likelihood of
   occurrences of different behaviours is a difficult task as motivational
   states are not observable. Furthermore, it is ecologically highly
   relevant and yet more complicated to scale an appropriate model for one
   individual up to the population level. In this manuscript (mixed) hidden
   Markov models (HMMs) are used to model the feeding behaviour of 54
   subadult grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), small nocturnal
   primates endemic to Madagascar that forage solitarily. Our primary aim
   is to introduce ecologists and other users to various HMM methods, many
   of which have been developed only recently, and which in this form have
   not previously been synthesized in the ecological literature. Our
   specific application of mixed HMMs aims at gaining a better
   understanding of mouse lemur behaviour, in particular concerning
   sex-specific differences. The model we consider incorporates random
   effects for accommodating heterogeneity across animals, i.e. accounts
   for different personalities of the animals. Additional subject- and
   time-specific covariates in the model describe the influence of sex,
   body mass and time of night.},

Pages = {164-171},

Abstract = {The endogenous circadian clock is entrained by external cues, mainly the
   light-dark cycle received by photopigments located in the retina. The
   authors investigated (1) the effect of aging on the synchronization of
   the rest-activity rhythm and (2) the physiological basis of light
   photoreception in the gray mouse lemur, a nocturnal Malagasy primate.
   Old individuals were tested at different irradiance levels under 3
   different light wavelengths previously shown to trigger maximal response
   in young adults. Investigators analyzed animal activity and temperature
   waveforms and used 2 reference treatments, strong white light and
   continuous darkness. The investigation revealed manifold effects of
   aging picturing a general loss of responsiveness to light and
   age-related changes in activity and temperature. In addition, the
   investigation shows that photoentrainment is a continuous process. Short
   wavelengths (430 nm) are more efficient than longer wavelengths (470-540
   nm) at low light levels at dawn and across all light levels at dusk.
   This suggests an implication of S-cones, differential at dawn and dusk.
   This results, surprising for several reasons, calls for further
   investigation. The study brings an interesting contribution to the
   understanding of the physiological processes underlying synchronization
   to light.},

Abstract = {Torpor is an energy-saving mechanism that allows endotherms to overcome
   energetic challenges. Torpor should be avoided during reproduction
   because of potential incompatibility with offspring growth. To test if
   torpor can be used during gestation and lactation to compensate for food
   shortage, we exposed reproductive female grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   murinus), a heterothermic primate, to different levels of food
   availability. Torpor use was characterised by daily skin temperature
   profiles, and its energetic outcome was assessed from changes in body
   mass. Food shortage triggered torpor during the end of the gestation
   period (n = 1), ranging from shallow in response to 40\% food
   restriction to deep daily torpor in response to 80\% restriction. During
   the early period of lactation, females fed ad libitum(n = 2) or exposed
   to a 40\% restriction (n = 4) remained normothermic; but 80\% food
   restricted females (n = 5) gave priority to energy saving, increasing
   the frequency and depth of torpor bouts. The use of torpor was
   insufficient to compensate for 80\% energetic shortage during lactation
   resulting in loss of mass from the mother and delayed growth in the
   pups. This study provides the first evidence that a heterothermic
   primate can use torpor to compensate for food shortages even during
   reproduction. This physiological flexibility likely evolved as a
   response to climate-driven fluctuations in food availability in
   Madagascar.},

   counter-strategies. Here we summarize long-term behavioural, demographic
   and genetic data collected on a plurally breeding primate from
   Madagascar to illuminate mechanisms and effects of female reproductive
   competition, focusing on forcible eviction and potential reproductive
   restraint. The main results of our study indicate that females in groups
   of redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) above a critical size suffer
   from competition from their close relatives: females in larger groups
   face an increased probability of not giving birth as well as a higher
   probability of being evicted, especially during the annual mating and
   birth seasons. Eviction is not predicted by the number of adult females,
   the number of close female relatives, female age or inter-annual
   variation in rainfall but only by total group size. Thus, eviction in
   this species is clearly linked with reproductive competition, it cannot
   be forestalled by reproductive restraint or having many relatives in the
   group, and it occurs in the absence of a clear dominance hierarchy. Our
   study therefore also underscores the notion that potential inclusive
   fitness benefits from living with relatives may have been generally
   over-rated and should not be taken for granted.},

Abstract = {We present several experiments aiming at measuring the semantic
   compositionality of NV expressions in Basque. Our approach is based on
   the hypothesis that compositionality can be related to distributional
   similarity. The contexts of each NV expression are compared with the
   contexts of its corresponding components, by means of different
   techniques, as similarity measures usually used with the Vector Space
   Model (VSM), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and some measures
   implemented in the Lemur Toolkit, as Indri index, tf-idf, Okapi index
   and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Using our previous work with
   cooccurrence techniques as a baseline, the results point to improvements
   using the Indri index or Kullback-Leibler divergence, and a slight
   further improvement when used in combination with cooccurrence measures
   such as t-score, via rank-aggregation. This work is part of a project
   for MWE extraction and characterization using different techniques
   aiming at measuring the properties related to idiomaticity, as
   institutionalization, non-compositionality and lexico-syntactic
   fixedness.},

Abstract = {One of the major topics in primate evolution is the phylogenetic
   position of the bizarre Daubentonia madagascariensis (DMA, aye-aye). The
   principal points that have been discussed for many decades are whether
   the aye-aye is: (i) the sister group of primates; (ii) the sister group
   of strepsirhines; or (iii) the sister group of lemurs. Very little is
   known about Daubentonia evolution, particularly on the chromosomal
   background. The present report focuses on the chromosomal history of
   this species. We used available chromosome painting data as the main
   source to identify conserved chromosomes, chromosomal segments and
   syntenic associations that have characterized the aye-aye karyotype. The
   dataset includes 47 characters that have been subjected to a
   concatenated analysis using maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian
   inference (BI). Both MP and BI topologies show Daubentonia as an
   independent monophyletic lineage, sister group of all other
   Strepsirhini. Further, both trees have weak statistical support as
   result of the high number of autapomorphies and homoplasies that have
   characterized the history of this group of species.},

Abstract = {The fossil `monkey lemur' Hadropithecus stenognathus has long excited
   palaeontologists because its skull bears an astonishing resemblance to
   those of robust australopiths, an enigmatic side branch of the human
   family tree. Multiple lines of evidence point to the likelihood that
   these australopiths ate at least some `hard', stress-limited food items,
   but conflicting data from H. stenognathus pose a conundrum. While its
   hominin-like craniofacial architecture is suggestive of an ability to
   generate high bite forces, details of its tooth structure suggest that
   it was not well equipped to withstand the forces imposed by cracking
   hard objects. Here, we use three-dimensional digital reconstructions and
   finite-element analysis to test the hard-object processing hypothesis.
   We show that Archaeolemur sp. cf. A. edwardsi, a longer-faced close
   relative of H. stenognathus that lacked hominin convergences, was
   probably capable of breaking apart large, stress-limited food items,
   while Hadropithecus was better suited to processing small,
   displacement-limited (tougher but more compliant) foods. Our suggestion
   that H. stenognathus was not a hard-object feeder has bearing on the
   interpretation of hominin cranial architecture; the features shared by
   H. stenognathus and robust australopiths do not necessarily reflect
   adaptations for hard-object processing.},

Title = {Functional and Evolutionary Significance of the Recruitment and Firing
   Patterns of the Jaw Adductors During Chewing in Verreaux's sifaka

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {145},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Jaw-muscle electromyographic (EMG) patterns indicate that compared with
   thick-tailed galagos and ring-tailed lemurs, anthropoids recruit more
   relative EMG from their balancing-side deep masseter, and that this
   muscle peaks late in the power stroke. These recruitment and firing
   patterns in anthropoids are thought to cause the mandibular symphysis to
   wishbone (lateral transverse bending), resulting in relatively high
   symphyseal stresses. We test the hypothesis that living strepsirrhines
   with robust, partially fused symphyses have muscle recruitment and
   firing patterns more similar to anthropoids, unlike those strepsirrhines
   with highly mobile unfused symphyses. Electromyographic (EMG) activity
   of the superficial and deep masseter, anterior and posterior temporalis,
   and medial pterygoid muscles were recorded in four dentally adult
   Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi). As predicted, we find that
   sifaka motor patterns are more similar to anthropoids. For example,
   among sifakas, recruitment levels of the balancing-side (b-s) deep
   masseter are high, and the b-s deep masseter fires late during the power
   stroke. As adult sifakas often exhibit nearly complete symphyseal
   fusion, these data support the hypothesis that the evolution of
   symphyseal fusion in primates is functionally linked to wishboning.
   Furthermore, these data provide compelling evidence for the convergent
   evolution of the wishboning motor patterns in anthropoids and sifakas.

Title = {Energetic costs of the immune response and torpor use in a primate},
Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {557-565},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {P>1. Resource-limiting conditions impose a change in the energetic
   distribution between competing physiological processes. Over the past
   decade there has been increasing interest in trade-offs between the
   immune system and competing energy-consuming life-history traits.
   However, the trade-offs with energy saving mechanisms, such as
   heterothermy, have received limited attention.
   2. The goal of this study is to determine how daily heterothermy
   expression could be adjusted to counterbalance the energetic
   requirements for the activation of the immune system depending on food
   availability (ad libitum vs. 40\% calorie restriction) in a
   heterothermic primate, the Grey Mouse Lemur (Microcebus murinus).
   3. On the day of the immune challenge, torpor was removed through the
   onset of fever, inducing a thermogenic cost. On the days following,
   food-restricted individuals returned to deep torpor (i.e. energy saving)
   whereas those fed ad libitum continued to skip torpor for at least three
   additional days.
   4. The rapid return to an energy saving state in food restricted
   individuals raises new questions on the relationship between body
   temperature and immunocompetence. We suggest that (i) hyperthermia
   provides the first line of defence against pathogens, which is a trait
   common to all organisms, (ii) but that hypothermia may also protect the
   host by inhibiting pathogen proliferation.},

Abstract = {Here we provide a detailed comparative analysis across the candidate
   X-Inactivation Center (XIC) region and the XIST locus in the genomes of
   six primates and three mammalian outgroup species. Since lemurs and
   other strepsirrhine primates represent the sister lineage to all other
   primates, this analysis focuses on lemurs to reconstruct the ancestral
   primate sequences and to gain insight into the evolution of this region
   and the genes within it. This comparative evolutionary genomics approach
   reveals significant expansion in genomic size across the XIC region in
   higher primates, with minimal size alterations across the XIST locus
   itself. Reconstructed primate ancestral XIC sequences show that the most
   dramatic changes during the past 80 million years occurred between the
   ancestral primate and the lineage leading to Old World monkeys. In
   contrast, the XIST locus compared between human and the primate ancestor
   does not indicate any dramatic changes to exons or XIST-specific
   repeats; rather, evolution of this locus reflects small incremental
   changes in overall sequence identity and short repeat insertions. While
   this comparative analysis reinforces that the region around XIST has
   been subject to significant genomic change, even among primates, our
   data suggest that evolution of the XIST sequences themselves represents
   only small lineage-specific changes across the past 80 million years.},

Title = {Genetic regulation of parasite infection: empirical evidence of the
   functional significance of an IL4 gene SNP on nematode infections in
   wild primates},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {Background: Susceptibility to parasite infection affects fitness-related
   processes, such as mate choice and survival, yet its genetic regulation
   remains poorly understood. Interleukin-4 (IL4) plays a central role in
   the humoral immune defence against nematode parasite infections,
   inducing IgE switch and regulation of worm expulsion from the
   intestines. The evolutionary and functional significance of single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL4-genes is known, yet empirical
   information on the effect of IL4 SNPs on gastro-intestinal infections is
   lacking. Using samples from a population of wild red-fronted lemurs
   (Eulemur fulvus rufus, Primates: Lemuridae), from western Madagascar, we
   explored the association of IL4-gene promoter polymorphisms with
   nematode infections and investigated a possible functional role of the
   IL4 polymorphism on male reproductive success.
   Results: Using sequence analyses of lemur DNA we detected a new SNP in
   the IL4 gene promoter area. Carriers of the genotype T/T showed higher
   nematode infection intensities than individuals of genotypes C/T and
   C/C. Genetic population analyses using data from more than 10 years,
   suggested higher reproductive success of T/T males than expected.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest a regulatory effect of an IL4 gene
   promoter polymorphism on the intensity of parasite infections in a
   natural population of red-fronted lemurs, with a seemingly
   disadvantageous genotype represented in low frequencies. Long-term
   population analyses, however, point in the direction of a negative
   frequency-dependent association, giving a fitness advantage to the rare
   genotype. Due to low frequencies of the genotype in question conclusive
   evidence of a functional role of IL4 polymorphism cannot be drawn here;
   still, we suggest the use of IL4 polymorphism as a new molecular tool
   for quick assessment of individual genetic constitution with regard to
   nematode infection intensities, contributing to a better understanding
   of the actual components of the immune response that mediate protection
   against gastro-intestinal parasites.},

Abstract = {In mammals individual distinctiveness in vocalizations provides the
   basis for individual recognition and thus plays an important role in
   social behavior. In this study, first evidence is provided for a
   nocturnal primate that variation in individual distinctiveness across
   the vocal repertoire is to some extent determined by the context and the
   acoustic structure of the call types. Individual distinctiveness was
   investigated across call types in the gray mouse lemur, a nocturnal
   primate, living in a dispersed multi-male multi-female social system. To
   explore to what degree context and acoustic structure predict variations
   in individual distinctiveness, four major call types were examined
   (grunts, tsaks, short whistles, and trills). Call types differed in
   context and acoustic structure and were recorded under controlled
   experimental conditions. A discriminant function analysis revealed that
   all call types are individually distinct, but not to the same degree.
   The findings suggest that variations in individual distinctiveness can
   to some extent be explained by the context and the acoustic structure of
   the call types. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America.

Title = {Structural Analysis of a Repetitive Protein Sequence Motif in
   Strepsirrhine Primate Amelogenin},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 18},
Abstract = {Strepsirrhines are members of a primate suborder that has a distinctive
   set of features associated with the development of the dentition.
   Amelogenin (AMEL), the better known of the enamel matrix proteins, forms
   90\% of the secreted organic matrix during amelogenesis. Although AMEL
   has been sequenced in numerous mammalian lineages, the only reported
   strepsirrhine AMEL sequences are those of the ring-tailed lemur and
   galago, which contain a set of additional proline-rich tandem repeats
   absent in all other primates species analyzed to date, but present in
   some non-primate mammals. Here, we first determined that these repeats
   are present in AMEL from three additional lemur species and thus are
   likely to be widespread throughout this group. To evaluate the
   functional relevance of these repeats in strepsirrhines, we engineered a
   mutated murine amelogenin sequence containing a similar proline-rich
   sequence to that of Lemur catta. In the monomeric form, the MQP
   insertions had no influence on the secondary structure or refolding
   properties, whereas in the assembled form, the insertions increased the
   hydrodynamic radii. We speculate that increased AMEL nanosphere size may
   influence enamel formation in strepsirrhine primates.},

Abstract = {A life-long follow-up of physiological and behavioural functions was
   initiated in 38-month-old mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) to test
   whether caloric restriction (CR) or a potential mimetic compound,
   resveratrol (RSV), can delay the ageing process and the onset of
   age-related diseases. Based on their potential survival of 12 years,
   mouse lemurs were assigned to three different groups: a control (CTL)
   group fed ad libitum, a CR group fed 70\% of the CTL caloric intake and
   a RSV group (200 mg/kg.day(-1)) fed ad libitum. Since this prosimian
   primate exhibits a marked annual rhythm in body mass gain during winter,
   animals were tested throughout the year to assess body composition,
   daily energy expenditure (DEE), resting metabolic rate (RMR), physical
   activity and hormonal levels. After 1 year, all mouse lemurs seemed in
   good health. CR animals showed a significantly decreased body mass
   compared with the other groups during long day period only. CR or RSV
   treatments did not affect body composition. CR induced a decrease in DEE
   without changes in RMR, whereas RSV induced a concomitant increase in
   DEE and RMR without any obvious modification of locomotor activity in
   both groups. Hormonal levels remained similar in each group. In summary,
   after 1 year of treatment CR and RSV induced differential metabolic
   responses but animals successfully acclimated to their imposed diets.
   The RESTRIKAL study can now be safely undertaken on a long-term basis to
   determine whether age-associated alterations in mouse lemurs are delayed
   with CR and if RSV can mimic these effects.},

Abstract = {As ecosystems undergo changes worldwide, physiological flexibility is
   likely to be an important adaptive response to increased climate
   instability. Extreme weather fluctuations impose energetical constraints
   such as unpredictable food shortage. We tested how grey mouse lemurs
   (Microcebus murinus) could adjust their daily heterothermy and locomotor
   activity to these `energetic accidents' with a food restriction
   experiment. The experimental design consisted of acute calorie
   restriction (2 weeks, 80\% restriction) in the middle of winter, after a
   fattening season with low (11 weeks, 40\% restriction) versus high (ad
   libitum) food availability. This design aimed at simulating the combined
   effects of the quality of the fattening season (acclimation effect) and
   a sudden, severe food shortage during the lean season. Hour of start and
   duration of torpor were the most flexible components of energy savings,
   increasing in response to the acute food shortage with facilitation by
   chronic restriction (acclimation effect). Modulations of locomotor
   activity did not support the hypothesis of energy savings, as total
   locomotor activity was not reduced. Nonetheless, acutely restricted
   individuals modified their temporal pattern of locomotor activity
   according to former food availability. We provide the first experimental
   evidence of different temporal levels of flexibility of energy-saving
   mechanisms in a heterotherm exposed to food shortage. The acclimation
   effect of past food scarcity suggests that heterothermic organisms are
   better able to respond to unpredicted food scarcity during the lean
   season. The flexible control of energy expenditure conferred by
   heterothermy may facilitate the plastic response of heterothermic
   species to more frequent climatic hazards.},

Title = {Cognitive Performances Are Selectively Enhanced during Chronic Caloric
   Restriction or Resveratrol Supplementation in a Primate},

Abstract = {Effects of an 18-month treatment with a moderate, chronic caloric
   restriction (CR) or an oral supplementation with resveratrol (RSV), a
   potential CR mimetic, on cognitive and motor performances were studied
   in non-human primates, grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus).
   Thirty-three adult male mouse lemurs were assigned to three different
   groups: a control (CTL) group fed ad libitum, a CR group fed 70\% of the
   CTL caloric intake, and an RSV group (RSV supplementation of 200
   mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) fed ad libitum. Three different cognitive tests, two
   motor tests, one emotional test and an analysis of cortisol level were
   performed in each group. Compared to CTL animals, CR or RSV animals did
   not show any change in motor performances evaluated by rotarod and jump
   tests, but an increase in spontaneous locomotor activity was observed in
   both groups. Working memory was improved by both treatments in the
   spontaneous alternation task. Despite a trend for CR group, only RSV
   supplementation increased spatial memory performances in the circular
   platform task. Finally, none of these treatments induced additional
   stress to the animals as reflected by similar results in the open field
   test and cortisol analyses compared to CTL animals. The present data
   provided the earliest evidence for a beneficial effect of CR or RSV
   supplementation on specific cognitive functions in a primate. Taken
   together, these results suggest that RSV could be a good candidate to
   mimic long-term CR effects and support the growing evidences that
   nutritional interventions can have beneficial effects on brain functions
   even in adults.},

Title = {Do diversification models of Madagascar's biota explain the population
   structure of the endemic bat Myotis goudoti (Chiroptera:
   Vespertilionidae)?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-54},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Aim
   Three mechanisms have been proposed to explain the adaptive radiations
   and species diversifications of Madagascar's biota: the ecogeographical
   constraint, the riverine barrier and the micro-endemism models. On the
   intraspecific level, each model predicts different patterns of gene flow
   across the island's physical and ecological features. To evaluate these
   models, phylogeographical analyses were conducted on a widespread and
   endemic species of bat, Myotis goudoti (Vespertilionidae).
   Location
   Madagascar.
   Methods
   In order to reconstruct the phylogeographical history of M. goudoti, the
   mitochondrial D-loop and the cytochrome b gene were sequenced for 195
   bats from 41 localities. Phylogenetic reconstructions and a minimum
   spanning tree were used to infer haplotype relationships. The effect of
   barriers on gene flow was evaluated using analyses of molecular variance
   and pairwise population differentiation. Mismatch distribution and
   coalescence-based estimates were conducted to infer the demographic
   history of M. goudoti.
   Results
   The sequenced individuals showed 159 distinct D-loop haplotypes, most of
   them being unique to a single location. Populations were significantly
   structured (Theta(ST) = 0.170, P < 0.001) across Madagascar, but only a
   minor part of the overall genetic variance was explained by any of the
   three models. Shared ancestry of lineages across most physical or
   ecological barriers was common, whereas the uncovered genetic
   differences between southern and central-northern populations were
   unexpected.
   Main conclusions
   Major barriers predicted by the three biogeographical models do not
   explain the segregation of mitochondrial lineages of M. goudoti across
   Madagascar. This is not simply attributable to the high dispersal
   ability of this species, as populations are notably structured. The
   genetic contrast between southern and central-northern populations,
   separated by a zone of admixture, suggests that these areas currently
   support populations that expanded during the Late Pleistocene. This
   latitudinal differentiation of populations has been observed in less
   vagile animals, such as geckos and lemurs, suggesting that climate
   fluctuations of the Pleistocene had an impact across several groups and
   resulted in northern and southern refugia in Madagascar.},

Abstract = {The similar to 37 million-year-old Birket Qarun Locality 2 (BQ-2), in
   the Birket Qarun Formation of Egypt's Fayum Depression, yields evidence
   for a diverse primate fauna, including the earliest known lorisiforms,
   parapithecoid anthropoids, and Afradapis longicristatus, a large
   folivorous adapiform Phylogenetic analysis has placed Afradapis as a
   stem strepsirrhine within a clade of caenopithecine adapiforms,
   contradicting the recently popularized alternative hypothesis aligning
   adapiforms with haplorhines or anthropoids. We describe an astragalus
   from BQ-2 (DPC 21445C), attributable to Afradapis on the basis of size
   and relative abundance. The astragalus is remarkably similar to those of
   extant lorises, having a low body, no posterior shelf, a broad head and
   neck It is like extant strepsirrhines more generally, in having a
   fibular facet that slopes gently away from the lateral tibial facet, and
   in having a groove for the tendon of flexor fibularis that is lateral to
   the tibial facet. Comparisons to a sample of euarchontan astragali show
   the new fossil to be most similar to those of adapines and lorisids. The
   astragali of other adapiforms are most similar to those of lemurs, but
   distinctly different from those of all anthropoids. Our measurements
   show that in extant strepsirrhines and adapiforms the fibular facet
   slopes away from the lateral tibial facet at a gradual angle (112-126
   degrees), in contrast to the anthropoid fibular facet, which forms a
   sharper angle (87-101 degrees). Phylogenetic analyses incorporating new
   information from the astragalus continue to support strepsirrhine
   affinities for adapiforms under varying models of character evolution.

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As undisturbed habitat becomes increasingly rare, managers charged with
   ensuring the survival of endangered primate species must increasingly
   utilize disturbed and degraded habitats in species survival plans. Yet
   we have an imperfect understanding of the true long-term viability of
   primate populations in disturbed habitat, and census data can be
   misleading because density is not necessarily correlated with habitat
   quality and population viability in predictable ways. Here we present
   clinical laboratory data on hematology, serum biochemistry, fat-soluble
   vitamins, minerals, iron analytes, viral serology, and parasitology of
   diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema), derived from the capture of 26
   individuals spanning eight groups and two habitats (undisturbed vs.
   disturbed and fragmented) at Tsinjoarivo, Madagascar. Blood from
   fragment individuals had significantly lower values for several factors:
   white blood cell counts, bilirubin, total protein, albumin, calcium,
   sodium, chloride, manganese, zinc, iron and total iron-binding capacity.
   Several biochemical variables were higher in immature individuals,
   probably due to active growth. The large number of interhabitat
   differences suggests that habitat disturbance has an impact on
   physiological health within this population, perhaps reflecting dietary
   stress and/or immunosuppression. These results, combined with previous
   data showing altered diet, slower juvenile growth, and reduced activity
   in disturbed forest fragments, suggest that fragment sifakas may be less
   healthy than continuous forest groups. Finally, Tsinjoarivo sifakas have
   extremely low blood urea nitrogen (perhaps reflecting protein
   limitation) and selenium levels relative to other lemurs. Despite their
   survival and reproduction in the short term in fragments, these sifakas
   may represent a riskier conservation investment than conspecifics in
   undisturbed forest, and may be more susceptible to environmental
   stressors. However, more data on the fitness consequences of these
   biochemical differences are needed for a better interpretation of their
   impacts on long-term viability prospects. Am. J. Primatol. 72:1013-1025,

Title = {It's All in the Timing: Birth Seasonality and Infant Survival in Eulemur
   rubriventer},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Pages = {715-735},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Highly seasonal breeding has been considered one of the keys to
   understanding Malagasy primate socioecology. Strict seasonal breeding
   may be particularly critical for Malagasy primates because they live in
   such energetically challenging seasonal environments. Lemurs also live
   in highly unpredictable environments, and there is growing evidence that
   reproductive timing may be mediated by additional factors, suggesting
   that more relaxed breeding seasonality is adaptive in some cases. I
   tested the adaptive breadth of the birth peak in Eulemur rubriventer,
   which breed in several different months. I describe reproduction in the
   species by determining the timing and extent of the birth season (period
   in which all births occur) and birth peak (period in which the majority
   of births occur); test whether relaxed reproductive seasonality might
   increase reproductive success by comparing infant mortality within and
   outside the birth peak; and model the extent to which fruit availability
   has an influence on the timing of reproduction. I collected birth data
   on 5 groups in 2003-2005, which I combined with demographic data that D.
   Overdorff collected from 5 focal groups and additional censused groups
   between 1988 and 1996. Thirty births occurred in 8 different months.
   Births were significantly seasonal, with a unimodal birth peak in late
   August/September/October, and a mean birth date of October 11.
   Twenty-three births (76.7\%) occurred within 54 d (14.79\%) of the year.
   No births occurred May-July, indicating that conceptions did not occur
   from late December through late February, and cycling (estimated using
   gestation length) did not occur until ca. 101 d after the austral summer
   solstice (December 21). Of 22 infants followed regularly, 18 were born
   in the birth peak, of which 2 died (11\%). All 4 infants born out of
   season died. Based on fruit availability, I calculated a Theoretical
   Overlap index (T), which indicated a 3-mo window with optimal food
   conditions for reproduction. This window corresponded to the timing and
   breadth of the birth peak in Eulemur rubriventer. These results indicate
   that a breeding season > 3 mo within a given year is not adaptive in the
   species, likely due in large part to the availability of fruit during
   key reproductive stages, particularly before breeding.},

Abstract = {Although mouse lemurs are solitary foragers, they are known to form
   sleeping associations. I examined several factors that could influence
   the choice to sleep communally and the composition of sleeping
   associations in Microcebus griseorufus, an inhabitant of the subarid
   spiny forest of southern Madagascar. These include the quantity and
   quality of available sleeping sites, socio-territoriality, predation
   risk, and thermoregulation. I radiotracked 26 individuals (12 males and
   14 females) and recorded 222 uses of 151 sleeping sites. Mouse lemurs
   slept most often in tree forks and tangles of vegetation and preferred
   sleeping sites in Alluaudia spp. (36\%) and Euphorbia spp. (30\%), 2
   very common tree genera in the spiny forest. Sleeping associations
   allowed the animals to use larger and more extensively overlapping home
   ranges and to have access to more food. Predation risk was much higher
   during nocturnal activity than during diurnal rest. Sleeping groups were
   small, usually pairs. Animals showed no signs of vigilance in sleeping
   sites and did not huddle consistently. Sleeping sites were chosen for
   their inaccessibility to predators and were well buffered against high
   and low ambient temperatures. Therefore, sleeping association was better

Title = {The three-panel runway maze adapted to Microcebus murinus reveals

Abstract = {Microcebus murinus, a mouse lemur primate appears to be a valuable model
   for cerebral aging study and for Alzheimer's disease model since they
   can develop p-amyloid plaques with age. Although the biological and
   biochemical analyses of cerebral aging are well documented, the
   cognitive abilities of this primate have not been thoroughly
   characterized. In this study, we adapted a spatial working memory
   procedure described in rodents, the sequential choice task in the
   three-panel runway, to mouse lemurs. We analyzed the age-related
   differences in a procedural memory task in the absence or presence of
   visual cues. Sixty percent of young adult and 48\% of aged lemurs
   completed the exploratory, choice habituation and testing phases at the
   beginning of the procedure. Young adult lemurs showed a higher level of
   perseverative errors compared with aged animals, particularly in the
   presence of visual stimuli. Over trials, old animals made more reference
   errors compared to young ones that improved quickly their performances
   under random level. No significant improvement was observed in young
   adults and old ones over sessions. This study showed that behavioural
   performances of M. murinus assessed on the sequential choice task in the
   three-panel runway markedly differ from the previously reported
   abilities of rodents. The behavioural response of young adult lemurs was
   influenced by novelty-related anxiety that contributed to their
   performance in terms of perseverative errors. Conversely, aged lemurs
   showed less perseverative errors, a rapid habituation to the three-panel
   runway maze, but made more memory errors. Overall, these findings
   demonstrate the feasibility to use the three-panel runway task in
   assessing memory performance, particularly in aged mouse lemurs. (c)

Title = {Hand and foot pressures in the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis)
   reveal novel biomechanical trade-offs required for walking on gracile
   digits},

Abstract = {Arboreal animals with prehensile hands must balance the complex demands
   of bone strength, grasping and manipulation. An informative example of
   this problem is that of the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), a
   rare lemuriform primate that is unusual in having exceptionally long,
   gracile fingers specialized for foraging. In addition, they are among
   the largest primates to engage in head-first descent on arboreal
   supports, a posture that should increase loads on their gracile digits.
   We test the hypothesis that aye-ayes will reduce pressure on their
   digits during locomotion by curling their fingers off the substrate.
   This hypothesis was tested using simultaneous videographic and pressure
   analysis of the hand, foot and digits for five adult aye-ayes during
   horizontal locomotion and during ascent and descent on a 30 instrumented
   runway. Aye-ayes consistently curled their fingers during locomotion on
   all slopes. When the digits were in contact with the substrate,
   pressures were negligible and significantly less than those experienced
   by the palm or pedal digits. In addition, aye-ayes lifted their hands
   vertically off the substrate instead of `toeing-off' and descended
   head-first at significantly slower speeds than on other slopes. Pressure
   on the hand increased during head-first descent relative to horizontal
   locomotion but not as much as the pressure increased on the foot during
   ascent. This distribution of pressure suggests that aye-ayes shift their
   weight posteriorly during head-first descent to reduce loads on their
   gracile fingers. This research demonstrates several novel biomechanical
   trade-offs to deal with complex functional demands on the mammalian
   skeleton.},

Series = {Developments in Primatology-Progress and Prospects},

Abstract = {Gummivory in cheirogaleids, apart from the specialist gummivore Phaner,
   is often viewed as a fall-back diet; animals are forced to consume gums
   when other foods are unavailable. We propose an alternative explanation
   that cheirogaleid gummivory is an adaptation to hypervariable
   environments. First, we compared morphological adaptations to gummivory
   evinced by cheirogaleids and other gummivorous primates. Despite
   convergent trends, adaptations to gummivory are quite variable. Second,
   a long-term field study of the reddish-grey mouse lemur, Microcebus
   griseorufus, in the highly variable xerophytic forest of southern
   Madagascar reveals this species to be the most specialized gummivore of
   all known mouse lemurs. Third, a comparison of the nutritional
   composition of gums and fruits consumed by M. griseorufus shows these
   two food types to be of equivalent nutritive content. Gums consumed by
   M. griseorufus are exuded all year round, increasing the predictability
   of food availability in a hypervariable habitat, while fruit
   availability exhibits high intra- and inter-annual variation. Finally,
   we compared the global distributions of gummivorous mammals with a map
   of the regions subject to El Nino-related droughts, which indicated a
   strong congruence between gummivory and hypervariability.},

Title = {Hallucal grasping in Nycticebus coucang: further implications for the
   functional significance of a large peroneal process},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-42},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Euprimate grasping feet are characterized by a suite of morphological
   traits, including an enlarged peroneal process on the base of the first
   metatarsal, which serves as the insertion site of the peroneus longus
   muscle. In prosimians, a large process has typically been associated
   with a powerful hallucal grasp via the contraction of the peroneus
   longus to adduct the hallux. Recent electromyography (EMG) studies have
   documented that peroneus longus does not contribute substantially to
   hallucal grasping in lemurids (Boyer et al., 2007). However, non-lemurid
   prosimians have a IN opposable grasp complex that is morphologically
   different and phylogenetically more primitive than the I-II adductor
   grasp complex of the lemurids previously studied. Therefore, it is
   possible that peroneus longus did function during grasping in early
   euprimates, but lost this function in large-bodied lemurids. The present
   study tests the hypothesis that a large peroneal process is related to
   powerful grasping ability in primates displaying the more primitive IN
   grasp complex. We use EMG to evaluate the recruitment of peroneus
   longus, other crural muscles, and adductor hallucis in static and
   locomotor grasping activities of the slow loris (Nycticebus coucang).
   Results show that peroneus longus is active during grasping behaviors
   that require the subject to actively resist inversion of the foot, and
   likely contributes to a hallucal grasp in these activities. Peroneus
   longus activity level does not differ between grasping and power
   grasping activities, nor does it differ between grasping and
   non-grasping locomotor modes. Conversely, the digital flexors and
   hallucal adductor are recruited at higher levels during power grasping
   and grasping locomotor modes. Consequently, we reject the hypothesis
   that an enlarged peroneal process represents an adaptation specifically
   to enhance the power of the IN grasp, but accept that the muscle likely
   plays a role in adducting the hallux during grasping behaviors that
   require stabilization of the ankle, and suggest that further work is
   necessary to determine if this role is sufficient to drive selection for
   a large peroneal process. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Spatial Variation in Density and Total Size Estimates in Fragmented

Year = {2010},
Volume = {72},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli) is an endangered
   lemur species found only in the Daraina region, a very restricted area
   in north-eastern Madagascar. Its forest habitat is highly fragmented and
   expected to suffer from significant changes in the near future. The
   species is poorly known and only one census study, carried out in 2000,
   has ever been published. It is thus crucial to update the conservation
   status of the golden-crowned sifaka. before major anthropogenic
   environmental changes take place. Using the line-transect approach, we
   estimated the species density in the main forest fragments located in
   both the peripheral and central parts of the distribution range,
   including both protected and unprotected areas. In parallel, we tried to
   determine whether an edge effect could be detected by comparing
   densities at different distances from the forest edges. We found
   important variation of sifaka densities among forest fragments. The
   total species abundance is thus difficult to determine, but we estimated
   that it is likely to be over 18,000, two to three times higher than
   previously thought. However, our data also suggested that most P.
   tattersalli live in forests located in the central part of the
   distribution range and that the estimated densities in the central part
   were high (> 80 individuals/km(2)). Two forest fragments, found to host
   a large part of the total population, are currently outside the managed
   area and their incorporation to the managed area is strongly
   recommended. Lastly, as expected for a folivorous and not heavily hunted
   species, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that this
   species does not experience a clear edge effect, at least during the
   first half of the dry season. This could be due to a high resiliency to
   habitat fragmentation or to the fact that fragmentation has been going
   on for some time. Am. J. Primatol. 72:72-80, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {Researchers studying individual variation in conspicuous skin coloration
   in primates have suggested that color indicates male quality. Although
   primate fur color can also be flamboyant, the potential condition
   dependence and thus signaling function of fur remains poorly studied. We
   studied sources of variation in sexually dichromatic facial hair
   coloration in red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus). We collected
   data on 13 adult males in Kirindy Forest, Madagascar, during two study
   periods in 2006 and 2007, to determine whether variation in facial hair
   coloration correlates with male age, rank, androgen status, and
   reproductive success. We quantified facial hair coloration via
   standardized digital photographs of each male, assessed androgen status
   using fecal hormone measurements, and obtained data on reproductive
   success through genetic paternity analyses. Male facial hair coloration
   showed high individual variation, and baseline coloration was related to
   individual androgen status but not to any other parameter tested. Color
   did not reflect rapid androgen changes during the mating season.
   However, pronounced long-term changes in androgen levels between years
   were accompanied by changes in facial hair coloration. Our data suggest
   that facial hair coloration in red-fronted lemur males is under
   proximate control of androgens and may provide some information about
   male quality, but it does not correlate with dominance rank or male
   reproductive success.},

Title = {Patterns of macroevolution among Primates inferred from a supermatrix of

Abstract = {Here, we present a new primate phylogeny inferred from molecular
   supermatrix analyses of size 42 kb containing 70\% of missing data, and
   representing 75\% of primate species diversity. The supermatrix was
   analysed using a gene-partitioned maximum likelihood approach to obtain
   an exhaustive molecular phylogenetic framework. All clades recovered
   from recent molecular works were upheld in our analyses demonstrating
   that the presence of missing data did not bias our supermatrix
   inference. The resulting phylogenetic tree was subsequently dated with a
   molecular dating method to provide a timescale for speciation events.
   Results obtained from our relaxed molecular clock analyses concurred
   with previous works based on the same fossil constraints. The resulting
   dated tree allowed to infer of macroevolutionary processes among the
   primates. Shifts in diversification rate and speciation rates were
   determined using the SymmeTREE method and a birthdeath process. No
   significant asymmetry was detected for the primate clade, but
   significant shifts in diversification rate were identified for seven
   clades: Anthropoidea, Lemuriformes, Lemuridae, Galagidae, Callithrix
   genus, the Cercopithecinae and Asian Macaca. Comparisons with previous
   primate supertree results reveal that (i) there was a diversification
   event at the root of the Lemuriformes, (ii) a higher diversification
   rate is detected for Cercopithecidae and Anthropoidea and (iii) a shift
   in diversification is always recovered for Macaca genus.
   Macroevolutionary inferences and primate divergence dates show that
   major primate diversification events occurred after the Paleogene,
   suggesting the extinction of ancient primate lineages. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {Darwin was struck by the many similarities between humans and other
   primates and believed that these similarities were the product of common
   ancestry. He would be even more impressed by the similarities if he had
   known what we have learned about primates over the last 50 years.
   Genetic kinship has emerged as the primary organizing force in the
   evolution of primate social organization and the patterning of social
   behaviour in non-human primate groups. There are pronounced nepotistic
   biases across the primate order, from tiny grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   murinus) that forage alone at night but cluster with relatives to sleep
   during the day, to cooperatively breeding marmosets that rely on closely
   related helpers to rear their young, rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta)
   females who acquire their mother's rank and form strict matrilineal
   dominance hierarchies, male howler monkeys that help their sons maintain
   access to groups of females and male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) that
   form lasting relationships with their brothers. As more evidence of
   nepotism has accumulated, important questions about the evolutionary
   processes underlying these kin biases have been raised. Although kin
   selection predicts that altruism will be biased in favour of relatives,
   it is difficult to assess whether primates actually conform to
   predictions derived from Hamilton's rule: br > c. In addition, other
   mechanisms, including contingent reciprocity and mutualism, could
   contribute to the nepotistic biases observed in non-human primate
   groups. There are good reasons to suspect that these processes may
   complement the effects of kin selection and amplify the extent of
   nepotistic biases in behaviour.},

Title = {Impaired Control of Body Cooling during Heterothermia Represents the
   Major Energetic Constraint in an Aging Non-Human Primate Exposed to Cold},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {4},

Abstract = {Daily heterothermia is used by small mammals for energy and water
   savings, and seems to be preferentially exhibited during winter rather
   than during summer. This feature induces a trade-off between the energy
   saved during daily heterothermia and the energy cost of arousal, which
   can impact energy balance and survival under harsh environmental
   conditions. Especially, aging may significantly affect such trade off
   during cold-induced energy stress, but direct evidences are still
   lacking. We hypothesized that aging could alter the energetics of daily
   heterothermia, and that the effects could differ according to season. In
   the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), a non-human primate species
   which exhibits daily heterothermia, we investigated the effects of
   exposures to 25 and 12 degrees C on body composition, energy balance,
   patterns of heterothermia and water turnover in adult (N = 8) and aged
   animals (N = 7) acclimated to winter-like or summer-like photoperiods.
   Acclimation to summer prevented animals from deep heterothermia, even
   during aging. During winter, adult animals at 12 degrees C and aged
   animals at 25 degrees C exhibited low levels of energy expenditure with
   minor modulations of heterothermia. The major effects of cold were
   observed during winter, and were particularly pronounced in aged mouse
   lemurs which exhibited deep heterothermia phases. Body composition was
   not significantly affected by age and could not explain the age-related
   differences in heterothermia patterns. However, aging was associated
   with increased levels of energy expenditure during cold exposure, in
   concomitance with impaired energy balance. Interestingly, increased
   energy expenditure and depth of heterothermia phases were strongly
   correlated. In conclusion, it appeared that the exhibition of shallow
   heterothermia allowed energy savings during winter in adult animals
   only. Aged animals exhibited deep heterothermia and increased levels of
   energy expenditure, impairing energy balance. Thus, an impaired control
   of the heterothermic process induced high energy costs in the aging
   mouse lemur exposed to cold.},

Title = {Duetting-A Mechanism to Strengthen Pair Bonds in a Dispersed Pair-Living

Abstract = {Duetting is defined as an interactively organized pair display in which
   one pair partner coordinates its vocalizations in time with those of the
   other. It is widespread among tropical birds and cohesive pair-living
   primates, in which it is suggested to strengthen pair bonds. We know
   very little about the presence and function of duetting in dispersed
   pair-living mammals. We studied duetting behavior in a solitary
   foraging, but pair-sleeping, primate, the Milne Edwards' sportive lemur,
   in a dry deciduous forest of north-western Madagascar. We radio-tracked
   six pairs throughout 1 year and recorded their sleeping sites and
   associations, home-range use, and vocal and behavioral interactions.
   Three different periods were covered (mating, pregnancy, and offspring
   care). Sleeping partners form long-term pair bonds, indicated by an
   almost exclusive pair-specific usage of sleeping sites and home-ranges
   across periods. We explored three functional hypothesis of duetting:
   mate reunion, pair reunion, and joint-territorial defense. Pairs
   regularly engaged in duet calling. Duetting increased significantly
   during the offspring care period. Duetting occurred significantly more
   often at feeding sites than at sleeping sites. Pair partners
   synchronized behavioral activities after duetting. The activity most
   often synchronized was locomotion. Pair partners played an equal role in
   duetting with no difference between sexes in starting or terminating
   duetting. Altogether, our results provide support for the hypothesis
   that in dispersed pair-living primates, duetting evolved as a mechanism
   to coordinate activities between pair partners dispersed in space, to
   strengthen pair bonds, and, perhaps, to limit infanticide and
   nutritional stress in lactating females. Am J Phys Anthropol

Abstract = {Prosimians (tarsiers and strepsirrhini) represent the basal lineages in
   primates and have a close bearing on the origin of primates. Although
   major lineages among anthropoidea (humans, apes and monkeys) are well
   represented by complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data, only
   one complete mtDNA sequence from a representative of each of the
   infraorders in prosimians has been described until quite recently, and
   therefore we newly determined complete mtDNA sequences from 5 lemurs, 4
   lorises, one tarsier and one platyrrhini. These sequences were provided
   to phylogenetic analyses in combination with the sequences from the 15
   primates species reported to the database.
   The position of tarsiers among primates could not be resolved by the
   maximum likelihood (ML) and neighbor-joining (NJ) analyses with several
   data sets. As to the position of tarsiers, any of the three alternative
   topologies (monophyly of haplorhini, monophyly of prosimians, and
   tarsiers being basal in primates) was not rejected at the significance
   level of 5\%, neither at the nucleotide nor at the amino acid level. In
   addition, the significant variations of C and T compositions were
   observed across primates species. Furthermore, we used AGY data sets for
   phylogenetic analyses in order to remove the effect of different C/T
   composition bias across species. The analyses of AGY data sets provided
   a medium support for the monophyly of haplorhini, which might have been
   screened by the variation in base composition of mtDNA across species.
   To estimates the speciation dates within primates, we analyzed the amino
   acid sequences of mt-proteins with a Bayesian method of Thorne and
   Kishino. Divergence dates were estimated as follows for the crown
   groups: about 35.4 million years ago (mya) for lorisiformes, 55.3 mya
   for lemuriformes, 64.5 mya for strepsirrhini, 70.1 mya for haplorhini
   and 76.0 mya for primates. Furthermore, we reexamined the biogeographic
   scenarios which have been proposed for the origin of strepsirrhini
   (lemuriformes and lorisiformes) and for the dispersal of the
   lemuriformes and lorisiformes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {No information is currently available on the space needs of hairy-eared
   dwarf lemurs (Allocebus trichotis), classified as Data Deficient. The
   data are crucial for their conservation and comparison with other
   nocturnal primates. I conducted the first radiotracking study of the
   species from January to December 2007 in the Analamazaotra Special
   Reserve of Central Eastern Madagascar. I used nocturnal focal individual
   follows and daytime nest locations to determine home ranges. I followed
   1 full sleeping group (4 adults) for 8 mo and 1 partial sleeping group
   (2 females) for 3 mo. Group home ranges, calculated via 100\% minimum
   convex polygons (MCP), were 35.5 ha and 16.0 ha, respectively. The 95\%
   kernel method of analysis yielded group home ranges of 15.2 ha and 7.1
   ha respectively. The mean home range size for individuals was 15.4 ha
   (MCP) and 5.4 ha (kernel). This is much larger than for other
   Cheirogaleidae and could be due to a more insectivorous diet or the use
   of patchily distributed gum-producing trees. There were small
   nonsignificant monthly variations in home range size. The mean home
   range size per individual per month was 5.2 ha (MCP) and 2.2 ha
   (kernel). Important individual differences in overall and monthly home
   range size could be due to variations in the individual reproductive
   cycles and survival strategies. Overlap analyses and the lack of sexual
   difference in home range size suggest the social unit is a family or
   multimale/multifemale sleeping group with monogamous or promiscuous
   mating. The Analamazaotra Special Reserve probably holds ca. 100 adult
   individuals. Additional research is urgently needed to clarify the
   habitat needs of this rare species.},

Title = {Females go where the food is: does the socio-ecological model explain

Abstract = {The socio-ecological model (SEM) links ecological factors with
   characteristics of social systems and allows predictions about the
   relationships between resource distribution, type of competition and
   social organisation. It has been mainly applied to group-living species
   but ought to explain variation in social organisation of solitary
   species as well. The aim of this study was to test basic predictions of
   the SEM in two solitary primates, which differ in two characteristics of
   female association patterns: (1) spatial ranging and (2) sleeping
   associations. Beginning in August 2002, we regularly (re-)captured and
   marked individuals of sympatric populations of Madame Berthe's and grey
   mouse lemurs (Microcebus berthae, Microcebus murinus) in Kirindy Forest
   (Madagascar). We recorded data on spatial patterns, feeding and social
   behaviour by means of direct observation of radio-collared females. The
   major food sources of M. berthae occurred in small dispersed patches
   leading to strong within-group scramble competition and over-dispersed
   females with a low potential for female associations. In contrast, M.
   murinus additionally used patchily distributed, high-quality (large)
   resources facilitating within-group contest competition. The combined
   influence of less strong within-group scramble and contest as well as
   between-group contest over non-food resources allowed females of this
   species to cluster in space. Additionally, we experimentally manipulated
   the spatial distribution of food sources and found that females adjusted
   their spatial patterns to food resource distribution. Thus, our results
   support basic predictions of the SEM and demonstrated that it can also
   explain variation in social organisation of solitary foragers.},

Abstract = {In this field study, the energetic properties of tropical hibernation
   were investigated by measuring oxygen consumption and body temperature
   of the Malagasy primate Cheirogaleus medius in their natural
   hibernacula. These lemurs use tree holes with extremely varying
   insulation capacities as hibernacula. In poorly insulated tree holes,
   tree hole temperature and body temperature fluctuated strongly each day
   (between 12.8 and 34.4A degrees C). The metabolic rate under these
   conditions also showed large daily fluctuations between about 29.0 ml
   O(2)/h and 97.9 ml O(2)/h in parallel with changes in body temperature.
   In well insulated tree holes in very large trees on the other hand, tree
   hole temperature and body temperature remained relatively constant at
   about 25A degrees C. Lemurs hibernating in these tree holes showed a
   more constant metabolic rate at an intermediate level, but hibernation
   was interrupted by repeated arousals with peak metabolic rates up to 350
   ml O(2)/h. The occurrence of these spontaneous arousals proved that the
   ability for thermoregulation persists during hibernation. Arousals were
   energetically costly, but much less so than in temperate and arctic
   hibernators. Despite the decisive influence of tree hole properties on
   the pattern of body temperature and metabolic rate during hibernation,
   the choice of the hibernaculum does not seem to be of energetic
   importance. The overall energetic savings by tropical hibernation
   amounted to about 70\% as compared to the active season (31.5 vs. 114.3
   kJ/d). Therefore, tropical hibernation in C. medius is an effective,
   well-regulated adaptive response to survive unfavourable seasons.},

Title = {THE EVOLUTION OF LOCAL ENDEMISM IN MADAGASCAR: WATERSHED VERSUS CLIMATIC
   GRADIENT HYPOTHESES EVALUATED BY NULL BIOGEOGRAPHIC MODELS},
Journal = {EVOLUTION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {63},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Substantial insular speciation has resulted in exceptionally high levels
   of endemism in Madagascar, creating locally restricted species' ranges
   that remain poorly understood. The contributions of alternative
   processes that could influence patterns of local endemism-including
   speciation by geographic isolation or adaptation to environmental
   gradients-are widely debated, both for Madagascar and elsewhere. A
   recently proposed hypothesis (the ``watershed hypothesis{''}) suggests
   that allopatric speciation driven by isolation in watersheds during
   Quaternary climate shifts provides a general explanation for patterns of
   local endemism across taxa in Madagascar. Here we tested coincidence
   between species' distributions and areas of endemism predicted by two
   contrasting biogeographic hypotheses: (1) the watershed hypothesis, and
   (2) an alternative hypothesis driven by climatic gradients (the
   ``current climate hypothesis{''}). Statistical significance of
   coincidence was assessed by comparing against a null model.
   Surprisingly, we found that extant distributions of lemurs, geckos, and
   chameleons reveal species patterns that are significantly coincident
   with the watershed and current climate hypotheses. These results
   strongly support local endemism developing from multiple processes, even
   among closely related species. Our findings thus indicate that
   pluralistic approaches will offer the best option both for understanding
   processes that generate local endemism, and for incorporating endemism
   within conservation priority setting.},

Booktitle = {REPRODUCTIVE SKEW IN VERTEBRATES: PROXIMATE AND ULTIMATE CAUSES},
Year = {2009},
Pages = {53-83},
Abstract = {We review available data documenting reproductive skew in the small
   group of mammals characterized by female dominance over males, focusing
   mainly on lemurs and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta). Although most
   females in all lemur species examined here appear to bear young at each
   opportunity, we know very little about variation in longer-term
   reproductive success or rates of reproduction among female lemurs.
   Therefore we cannot draw firm conclusions in regard to reproductive skew
   among female lemurs except that at present this appears to be slight.
   However, current data show that female lemurs typically mate with
   multiple males, and that a substantial fraction of litters containing
   multiple offspring is sired by more than one male. The extent of
   reproductive skew in male lemurs varies among species, but there is a
   slight trend, among the lemur species for which genetic data exist, for
   male skew to decrease as the intensity of female dominance increases.
   Variance in reproductive success among female spotted hyenas appears to
   be substantially greater than it is in male-dominated species in which
   plural breeding occurs. In this species, female dominance, combined with
   virilization of the external genitalia, may increase female control over
   mating to its extreme limit, such that we find very little reproductive
   skew among males relative to that found in other polygynous mammals. The
   most dominant male hyenas often achieve very little reproductive
   success. Overall, reproductive skew among females in female-dominated
   mammals appears to be the same as or slightly greater than that in
   male-dominated species, whereas skew among males in female-dominated
   species generally tends to be relatively low.},

Title = {Seeing red: behavioral evidence of trichromatic color vision in
   strepsirrhine primates},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Among primates, catarrhines (Old World monkeys and apes) and certain
   platyrrhines (New World monkeys) possess trichromatic color vision,
   which might confer important evolutionary advantages, particularly
   during foraging. Recently, a polymorphism has been shown to shift the
   spectral sensitivity of the X-linked opsin protein in certain
   strepsirrhines (e.g., Malagasy lemurs); however, its behavioral
   significance remains unknown. We assign genotypes at the X-linked
   variant to 45 lemurs, representing 4 species, and test if the genetic
   capacity for trichromacy impacts foraging performance, particularly
   under green camouflage conditions in which red detection can be
   advantageous. We confirm polymorphism at the critical site in sifakas
   and ruffed lemurs and fail to find this polymorphism in collared lemurs
   and ring-tailed lemurs. We show that this polymorphism may be linked to
   ``behavioral trichromacy{''} in heterozygous ruffed lemurs but find no
   comparable evidence in a single heterozygous sifaka. Despite their
   putative dichromatic vision, female collared lemurs were surprisingly
   efficient at retrieving both red and green food items under camouflage
   conditions. Thus, species-specific feeding ecologies may be as important
   as trichromacy in influencing foraging behavior. Although the lemur
   opsin polymorphism produced measurable behavioral effects in at least
   one species, the ruffed lemur, these effects were modest, consistent
   with the modest shift in spectral sensitivity. Additionally, the
   magnitude of these effects varied across individuals of the same
   genotype, emphasizing the need for combined genetic and behavioral
   studies of trichromatic vision. We conclude that trichromacy may be only
   one of several routes toward increased foraging efficiency in visually
   complex environments.},

Title = {Sex Ratio at Birth and Age-Reversed Dominance among Female Varecia},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {80},
Number = {5},
Pages = {341-352},
Abstract = {Analysis of 283 offspring born at the Duke University Primate Center
   show that young female ruffed lemurs, Varecia variegata, produce
   significantly more daughters, whereas old mothers produce more sons than
   expected. Data are compared to 3 hypotheses for sex ratio bias: the
   Trivers-Willard hypothesis which predicts that dominant females produce
   more males, the local resource competition (LRC) hypothesis which
   predicts that subordinate females produce more males, and the local
   resource enhancement (LRE) extension of the LRC hypothesis that females
   produce the sex that provides later cooperative benefits. In the case of
   Varecia, this may include alloparenting or cooperative breeding. The
   results are more consistent with the LRC model. However, observations of
   8 mother-daughter relationships show that female dominance rank in
   free-ranging Varecia groups is age reversed, with daughters aggressively
   outranking their mothers. Daughters born into the group were not
   beneficial as future supporters in within-group intermatriline
   competition as assumed by the LRE model, or as subordinate alloparents,
   cooperative breeders or aids in territorial defense. Both sex ratio and
   ranking observations are consistent, however, with the hypothesis that
   mothers produce daughters when they are young and able to invade
   elsewhere and sons as they age and are less able to do so. This is
   supported by a single observation of a mother dispersing which resulted
   in her daughter inheriting the natal territory. These data are
   supportive of the LRE model with female alliances and cooperative
   breeding among dispersed females. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {Most Malagasy primate communities harbor a diverse assemblage of
   omnivorous species. The mechanisms allowing the coexistence of closely
   related species are poorly understood, partly because only preliminary
   data on the feeding ecology of most species are available. We provide an
   exemplary feeding ecology data set to illuminate coexistence mechanisms
   between sympatric gray and Madame Berthe's mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   murinus, M. berthae). We studied their feeding ecology in Kirindy
   Forest/CFPF, a highly seasonal dry deciduous forest in western
   Madagascar. Between August 2002 and December 2007, we regularly
   (re-)captured, marked, and radiotracked females of both species. A
   combination of direct behavioral observations and fecal analyses
   revealed that both Microcebus species used fruit, arthropods, gum,
   insect secretions, and small vertebrates as food sources. However,
   Microcebus berthae and M. murinus differed in both composition and
   seasonal variation of their diets. Whereas the diet of Microcebus
   murinus varied seasonally and was generally more diverse, M. berthae
   relied mainly on insect secretions supplemented by animal matter. The
   differences were also reflected in a very narrow feeding niche of
   Microcebus berthae and a comparatively broad feeding niche of M.
   murinus. Resource use patterns of Madame Berthe's and more so of
   opportunistic gray mouse lemurs broadly followed resource availability
   within the strongly seasonal dry forest. Feeding niche overlap between
   the 2 sympatric species was high, indicating that food resource usage
   patterns did not reflect niche partitioning, but can instead be
   explained by constraints due to food availability.},

Abstract = {The degree to which historical human activities negatively impacted past
   and present lemur species is a long-standing question in primatology. At
   present, most evidence addressing this issue comes from archaeology,
   paleontology, and behavioral studies. Genetic data provide another
   source of evidence. In this study, six microsatellite loci, genotyped on
   more than 360 wild Verreaux's sifaka, are used in order to test the
   hypothesis that this population experienced a population bottleneck in
   the last 2000 years. Excess heterozygosity is compared with the
   heterozygosity expected under mutation-drift equilibrium in order to
   test for the genetic signature of a rapid population contraction in the
   past. The results indicate that the sifaka population did not experience
   a population bottleneck. Various methodological and conceptual
   implications of this result are discussed.},

Abstract = {Franz Sikora found the first specimen and type of the recently extinct
   Hadropithecus stenognathus in Madagascar in 1899 and sent it to Ludwig
   Lorenz von Liburnau of the Austrian Imperial Academy of Sciences. Later,
   he sent several more specimens including a subadult skull that was
   described by Lorenz von Liburnau in 1902. In 2003, some of us excavated
   at the locality and found more specimens belonging to this species,
   including much of a subadult skeleton. Two frontal fragments were found,
   and these, together with most of the postcranial bones, belong to the
   skull. CT scans of the skull and other jaw fragments were made in Vienna
   and those of the frontal fragments at Penn State University. The two
   fragments have been reunited with the skull in silico, and broken parts
   from one side of the skull have been replaced virtually by mirror-imaged
   complete parts from the other side. The parts of the jaw of another
   individual of a slightly younger dental age have also been reconstructed
   virtually from CT scans with mirror imaging and by using the maxillary
   teeth and temporomandibular joints as a guide to finish the
   reconstruction. Apart from forming a virtual skull for biomechanical and
   systematic analysis, we were also able to make a virtual endocast.
   Missing anterior pieces were reconstructed by using part of an endocast
   of the related Archaeolemur majori. The volume is 115 ml. Hadropithecus
   and Archaeolemur seem to have had relatively large brains compared with
   the other large-bodied subfossil lemurs.},

Abstract = {We provide a survey of a folivorous lemur, Propithecus verreauxi
   (sifaka), in the Berenty Reserve, southern Madagascar. Higher densities
   of folivores in small patches occur in either high-quality food areas or
   in less disturbed refugia. The skewness of sex ratio, which in lemurs is
   often male-biased, can be critically exacerbated in population stress.
   We predicted that sifaka would show higher densities in areas where
   protein-rich food is abundant (prediction 1a) and in refugium areas
   (prediction 1b). Owing to increased competition by brown and ring-tailed
   lemurs and decreased food production by tamarind trees, we expected an
   extremely male-biased sex ratio (prediction 2). In November-December
   2006, we counted and sexed 206 adult/subadult sifaka (49 groups) during
   daily walks in different forest zones (Ankoba secondary forest, to the
   north, Malaza gallery/scrub areas, and spiny forest, to the south).
   Sifaka may have decreased in the gallery forest to concentrate in Ankoba
   (in a sort of out-of-Malaza). The area contains protein-rich food
   (prediction 1a confirmed). Sifaka are proportionally more concentrated
   in the spiny area than in the degraded scrub forest (prediction 1b
   confirmed). The sex ratio is extremely male biased, possibly due to
   either high sifaka density, in Ankoba, or food availability reduction,
   in Malaza (prediction 2 confirmed). The sifaka population seems to be
   under stress: researchers need to resume demographic studies,
   interrupted in Berenty in the mid-1980s, to preserve in situ a species
   that is difficult to protect ex situ.},

Abstract = {Cold resistance appears altered with aging. Among existing hypotheses,
   the impaired capacity in response to cold could be related to an altered
   regulation of plasma IGF-1 concentration. The combined effects of age
   and cold exposure were studied in a short-living primate, the gray mouse
   lemur ( Microcebus murinus), which adjusts its energy balance using a
   daily torpor phase, to avoid high energy cost of normothermia
   maintenance. Changes in body mass, core temperature, locomotor activity,
   and caloric intake were monitored under 9-day exposures to 25 degrees C
   and 12 C in captive animals in winter conditions. Short-term ( after 2
   days) and long-term ( after 9 days) cold-induced changes in IGF-1 levels
   were also evaluated. In thermo-neutral conditions ( 25 C), general
   characteristics of the daily rhythm of core temperature were preserved
   with age. At 12 C, age-related changes were mainly characterized by a
   deeper hypothermia and an increased frequency of torpor phases,
   associated with a loss of body mass. A short-term cold-induced decrease
   in plasma IGF-1 levels was observed. IGF-1 levels returned to basal
   values after 9 days of cold exposure. No significant effect of age could
   be evidenced on IGF-1 response. However, IGF-1 levels of cold-exposed
   aged animals were negatively correlated with the frequency of daily
   torpor. Responses exhibited by aged mouse lemurs exposed to cold
   revealed difficulties in the maintenance of normothermia and energy
   balance and might involve modulations of IGF-1 levels.},

Title = {The costs of risky male behaviour: sex differences in seasonal survival

Volume = {275},

Abstract = {Male excess mortality is widespread among mammals and frequently
   interpreted as a cost of sexually selected traits that enhance male
   reproductive success. Sex differences in the propensity to engage in
   risky behaviours are often invoked to explain the sex gap in survival.
   Here, we aim to isolate and quantify the survival consequences of two
   potentially risky male behavioural strategies in a small sexually
   monomorphic primate, the grey mouse lemur Microcebus murinus: (i) most
   females hibernate during a large part of the austral winter, whereas
   most males remain active and (ii) during the brief annual mating season
   males roam widely in search of receptive females. Using a 10-year
   capture-mark-recapture dataset from a population of M. murinus in
   Kirindy Forest, western Madagascar, we statistically modelled
   sex-specific seasonal survival probabilities. Surprisingly, we did not
   find any evidence for direct survival benefits of hibernation-winter
   survival did not differ between males and females. By contrast, during
   the breeding season males survived less well than females (sex gap:
   16\%). Consistent with the `risky male behaviour' hypothesis, the period
   for lowered male survival was restricted to the short mating season.
   Thus, sex differences in survival in a promiscuous mammal can be
   substantial even in the absence of sexual dimorphism.},

Title = {Acoustic divergence in the communication of cryptic species of nocturnal
   primates (Microcebus ssp.)},
Journal = {BMC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Background: A central question in evolutionary biology is how cryptic
   species maintain species cohesiveness in an area of sympatry. The
   coexistence of sympatrically living cryptic species requires the
   evolution of species-specific signalling and recognition systems. In
   nocturnal, dispersed living species, specific vocalisations have been
   suggested to act as an ideal premating isolation mechanism. We studied
   the structure and perception of male advertisement calls of three
   nocturnal, dispersed living mouse lemur species, the grey mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus), the golden brown mouse lemur (M. ravelobensis) and
   the Goodman's mouse lemur (M. lehilahytsara). The first two species
   occur sympatrically, the latter lives allopatrically to them.
   Results: A multi-parameter sound analysis revealed prominent differences
   in the frequency contour and in the duration of advertisement calls. To
   test whether mouse lemurs respond specifically to calls of the different
   species, we conducted a playback experiment with M. murinus from the
   field using advertisement calls and alarm whistle calls of all three
   species. Individuals responded significantly stronger to conspecific
   than to heterospecific advertisement calls but there were no differences
   in response behaviour towards statistically similar whistle calls of the
   three species. Furthermore, sympatric calls evoked weaker interest than
   allopatric advertisement calls.
   Conclusion: Our results provide the first evidence for a specific
   relevance of social calls for speciation in cryptic primates. They
   furthermore support that specific differences in signalling and
   recognition systems represent an efficient premating isolation mechanism
   contributing to species cohesiveness in sympatrically living species.},

   extinct rnegafauna. Expeditions in 2000 and 2003 produced a wealth of
   new material and provided the First systematic information concerning
   the genesis, stratigraphy, and taphonomy of the site. Recovered bones of
   one of the most Poorly understood extinct large lemurs, Hadropithecus
   stenognathus, include many skeletal elements previously unknown.
   Radiocarbon dates show that the site has sampled this disappeared fauna
   in the mid-to-late Holocene, but that bone-bearing layers are
   stratigraphically mixed, probably Owing to the effects of reworking of
   the sediments by extreme marine events. The diverse biota recovered
   contains elements of both eastern rain forest and Southwestern arid
   bushland, reflecting the cave's position in the zone of transition
   between wet and dry biomes. Bones Of two unusual small mammals add to
   the previously long faunal list for the site: 1) the First fossil
   evidence for Macrotarsomys petteri, a large-bodied endemic nesomyid
   rodent previously known only from a single modern specimen; and 2) the
   type specimen and additional material of a newly described extinct
   shrew-tenrec (Microgale macpheei). Evidence for prehistoric and
   colonial-era humans Includes artifacts, hearth deposits, and remains of
   human domesticates and Other introduced species. Although previously
   protected by its extreme isolation, the unique site is vulnerable to
   exploitation. An incipient tourist Industry is likely to bring more
   people to the cave, and there is currently no form of protection
   afforded to the site.},

Abstract = {The dry spiny forest of southern Madagascar is a highly unpredictable
   environment in terms of the amount and distribution of rainfall. The
   region is also subject to marked El Nino oscillations. One of the
   inhabitants of the region is Microcebus griseorufus (Kollman, 1910), the
   reddish-grey mouse lemur. During the 4 yr of the study, the focal
   population underwent marked fluctuations in size and exhibited a
   relatively long reproductive season: September-May. Subjects used daily
   torpor and expressed opportunistic seasonal fattening when food
   availability was high. They fed mainly on gum, especially during periods
   of drought. The estimated sex-ratio of the population is 54\% female.
   Young males dispersed. Females and less frequently, males, associated in
   same-sex pairs that sometimes joined to form larger sleeping groups. I
   observed both erratic and resident males, the latter sometimes
   associated with females in sleeping groups. Mating occurred from
   September to January and involved mate-guarding. Individual female home
   ranges (N=14) overlapped with, on average, 2.8 +/- 0.3 male home ranges
   (range 2-5), whereas individual male home ranges (N=12) overlapped with
   4.7 +/- 0.4 female home ranges (range 2-7). Female estrus was not
   synchronized, even within the female pairs, allowing alloparental care.
   Gestation lasted 52 d in 1 female, and litter size could be as high as
   3; 20 reproductive females out of 37 adult females raised only 1 or 2
   young per year.},

Abstract = {The mechanisms and temporal aspects of mate choice according to genetic
   constitution are still puzzling. Recent studies indicate that fitness is
   positively related to diversity in immune genes (MHC). Both sexes should
   therefore choose mates of high genetic quality and/or compatibility.
   However, studies addressing the role of MHC diversity in pre- and
   post-copulatory mate choice decisions in wild-living animals are few. We
   investigated the impact of MHC constitution and of neutral
   microsatellite variability on pre- and post-copulatory mate choice in
   both sexes in a wild population of a promiscuous primate, the greymouse
   lemur (Microcebus murinus). There was no support for pre- copulatory
   male or female mate choice, but our data indicate post-copulatory mate
   choice that is associated with genetic constitution. Fathers had a
   higher number of MHC supertypes different from those of the mother than
   randomly assigned males. Fathers also had a higher amino acid distance
   to the females' MHC as well as a higher total number of MHC supertypes
   and a higher degree of microsatellite heterozygosity than randomly
   assigned males. Female cryptic choice may be the underlying mechanism
   that operates towards an optimization of the genetic constitution of
   offspring. This is the first study that provides support for the
   importance of the MHC constitution in post-copulatory mate choice in
   non-human primates.},

Title = {Ontogeny of conspecific and heterospecific alarm call recognition in

Volume = {70},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The production of vocalizations in nonhuman primates is predominantly
   innate, whereas learning influences the usage and comprehension of
   vocalizations. In this study, I examined the development of alarm call
   recognition in free-ranging infant Verreaux's sifakas. Specifically, I
   investigated their ability to recognize conspecific alarm calls as well
   as those of sympatric redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus) in
   Kirindy forest, western Madagascar. Both species have functionally
   referential alarm calls for aerial. predators and give general alarm
   calls for both aerial and general predators and also other kinds of
   threats, such as intergroup encounters with conspecifics. I conducted
   playback experiments with members of two birth cohorts (nine and ten
   individuals) to determine the age at which infant Verreaux's sifakas
   discriminate between conspecific alarm calls, heterospecific alarm
   calls, and non-alarm vocalizations (parrot song). Most 3-4 months old
   infants fled toward adults after hearing any playback stimuli, whereas
   4-5-month-old infants did so only after presentation of alarm calls.
   Moreover, all infants of these age classes showed a longer latency to
   flee after the parrot song indicating their emerging ability to
   discriminate between alarm calls and non-alarm stimuli. At an age of
   about 6 months, infants switched from fleeing toward adults to
   performing adult-like escape responses after presentation of conspecific
   and heterospecific alarm calls. Thus, the ability to discriminate
   between alarm from non-alarm stimuli precedes the appearance of
   adult-like responses. The transition to adult-like escape behavior was
   coincident with the physical independence of infants from their mothers.},

Title = {Sex-specific asymmetries in communication sound perception are not
   related to hand preference in an early primate},
Journal = {BMC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {Background: Left hemispheric dominance of language processing and
   handedness, previously thought to be unique to humans, is currently
   under debate. To gain an insight into the origin of lateralization in
   primates, we have studied gray mouse lemurs, suggested to represent the
   most ancestral primate condition. We explored potential functional
   asymmetries on the behavioral level by applying a combined handedness
   and auditory perception task. For testing handedness, we used a forced
   food-grasping task. For testing auditory perception, we adapted the head
   turn paradigm, originally established for exploring hemispheric
   specializations in conspecific sound processing in Old World monkeys,
   and exposed 38 subjects to control sounds and conspecific communication
   sounds of positive and negative emotional valence.
   Results: The tested mouse lemur population did not show an asymmetry in
   hand preference or in orientation towards conspecific communication
   sounds. However, males, but not females, exhibited a significant right
   ear-left hemisphere bias when exposed to conspecific communication
   sounds of negative emotional valence. Orientation asymmetries were not
   related to hand preference.
   Conclusion: Our results provide the first evidence for sex-specific
   asymmetries for conspecific communication sound perception in non-human
   primates. Furthermore, they suggest that hemispheric dominance for
   communication sound processing evolved before handedness and
   independently from each other.},

Title = {Diurnality and nocturnality in nonhuman primates: comparative
   chronobiological studies in laboratory and nature},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {229-267},
Abstract = {Looking for differences in circadian clock characteristics of diurnal
   and nocturnal nonhuman primates, this article summarizes results of
   chronobiological studies carried out in various nocturnal, diurnal, and
   cathemeral prosimian and anthropoid primate species under controlled
   laboratory conditions, under seminatural conditions, and in the wild. In
   almost all circadian parameters investigated, no differences were
   discernible between the two main chrono-ecotypes, either in circadian
   period length and the influence upon it of after-effects, of light
   intensity, and ambient temperature, or in the PRC, re-entrainment
   behavior, rhythm splitting, and internal desynchronization. Diurnal and
   nocturnal or cathemeral species differed only in the phase of artificial
   or natural LDs to which their circadian activity phase was adjusted as
   well as in the characteristics of masking activity upon the rhythms
   produced by the direct inhibiting or enhancing effects of light.
   Pronounced lunar periodicity - observed in the activity rhythm of
   nocturnal neotropical owl monkeys, genus Aotus, in seminatural and
   natural environments as well as in wild cathemeral Malagasy lemurs,
   genus Eulemur - is shown to result from masking effects of moonlight. In
   captive Eulemur fulvus albifrons, a change from dark-active over
   cathemeral to light-active behavior, without concurrently changing the
   circadian phase-setting of activity to D, was produced by direct masking
   effects of a stepwise reduction of darktime luminosity on an LD 12:12
   cycle. Long-term activity recordings carried out in wild diurnal
   Malagasy sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) and cathemeral redfronted
   lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus), as well as in wild nocturnal owl monkeys
   (Aotus a. azarai) of the North Argentinean Chaco, yielded in all species
   distinct bimodal long- and short-day activity patterns with pronounced
   peaks during dusk and dawn. Applying Pittendrigh's two-oscillator
   concept to these results, it is hypothesized that the differences in
   chrono-ecotype behavior may result from variations in internal coupling
   and external phase-setting of morning and evening oscillators (m, e) to
   dawn and dusk, interacting with direct masking effects of light.},

Abstract = {In this study we investigated the importance of biparental care for the
   evolution and/or maintenance of pair-living in red-tailed sportive
   lemurs (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), a nocturnal folivorous lemur. Between
   2000 and 2005, we collected data on life history traits from a total of
   14 radio-collared pairs of adults and their offspring in Kirindy forest,
   western Madagascar. Predation rate varied between years with a minimum
   of 0\% and a maximum of 40\% per year. Patterns of parental care were
   quantified during simultaneous focal observations of both pair-partners
   in 2003 and 2004. Mating activity was limited to the months of May and
   June, as indicated by conspicuous changes of vulval morphology and male
   mate guarding behavior. After a gestation length of about 5 months,
   which is much longer than expected for a lemur of this body mass, single
   infants were born in November. Lactation lasted for about 50 days. Apart
   from lactation, females provided infant care by warming, grooming and
   transporting infants orally. Infants were parked in dense vegetation
   while females foraged. Males were seen only rarely in proximity to
   infants and we found no evidence for direct infant care provided by
   social fathers. We conclude that the necessity of direct infant care
   cannot explain the evolution and/or maintenance of pair-living in
   Lepilemur ruficaudatus.},

Abstract = {Female promiscuity is common in mammals and leads to sperm competition:
   the sperm of >= 2 males compete for ova. Scientists understand the

   competition and the role of optimal insemination periods in gray mouse
   lemurs (Microcebus murinus), a small solitary nocturnal primate from
   Madagascar. We used controlled matings to identify the relative impact
   of both contest and scramble competition, which characterize their
   mating system, on paternity. Fifteen females mated with 3-6 males in
   quick succession. Our experiments revealed that the optimal insemination
   period is during early receptivity. Early but not first mating males are

Abstract = {The indriid genus Propithecus comprises the sifakas, medium-sized lemurs
   endemic to the forests of Madagascar. Traditionally, scientists divided
   the genus into only 2 or 3 species -Propithecus diadema, P. verreauxi,
   and, since 1988, P. tattersalli- with 4 or 5 subspecies in each of the
   first 2 taxa, but recent authors have suggested that many more distinct
   species should be recognized. We draw from quantitative and qualitative
   studies of craniodental traits to evaluate further the phenetic
   distinctiveness and taxonomic status of each named form of Propithecus.
   We recognize 9-10 species in the genus. The 4 or 5 species of the
   Propithecus diadema group -P. diadema, P. candidus, P. perrieri, P.
   edwardsi, and perhaps P. holomelas, if distinct- share several derived
   features, including large average body size and a mandible specialized
   for rotational chewing, and clearly comprise a closely related complex.
   The 5 species of the Propithecus verreauxi group -P. verreauxi, P.
   coquereli, P. deckenii, P. coronatus, P. tattersalli- are each highly
   distinctive morphologically and likely do not comprise a monophyletic
   group. In particular, we point out the highly distinctive cranial
   features of Propithecus coronatus, which researchers have traditionally
   largely overlooked.},

   importance of major histocompatibility complex supertypes in a

Journal = {HEREDITY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {99},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Current discussions in evolutionary ecology and conservation genetics
   focus on the relative importance of using selective neutral markers or
   markers of coding genes to identify adaptive and evolutionary relevant
   processes. Genetic diversity might be particularly important in immune
   genes ( e. g., in genes of the major histocompatibility complex, MHC),
   which are influencing pathogen and parasite resistance. We investigated
   the effects of neutral versus adaptive genetic variation in parasite
   resistance in a natural population of fat-tailed dwarf lemurs (
   Cheirogaleus medius). No association between neutral overall individual
   genetic diversity and parasite load could be detected. In 149
   individuals, we identified 50 MHC class II alleles of the functionally
   important duplicated DRB locus. The investigation of the functional
   importance of immune gene ( MHC) diversity and parasite selection in
   natural populations is often problematic due to extensive polymorphism
   in the MHC genes and restrictions in available sample sizes. Here, for
   the first time we applied an approach that has been developed in human
   medical studies. Eleven MHC class II supertypes were identified based on
   shared antigen-binding similarities. The number of individual MHC
   supertypes had no influence on the nematode burden. However, we found
   evidence for a specific MHC supertype ( supertype 1) that was linked to
   infected individuals, a higher number of different nematode infections
   and high intensity of infection per individual. Moreover, one rare MHC
   supertype ( supertype 7) was revealed to be advantageous with respect to
   parasite burden. Thus, our results add evidence to the small body of
   studies that show significant associations between specific MHC
   constitutions and naturally occurring parasites in the complexity of
   natural populations.},

Abstract = {Sportive lemurs are threatened species in the IUCN Red Data Book.
   However, quantitative information on their reproduction, urgently
   required for conservation, has been lacking. We collected first data on
   reproductive activity of Milne-Edwards' sportive lemurs in a population
   inhabiting the dry deciduous forest of the Ankarafantsika National Park
   in northwestern Madagascar during 1998, 2001, and 2003. The species
   showed a seasonal reproduction. The main mating season extended from May
   to June, as indicated by the presence of males with high testes volumes
   and estrus females. In the mating and early postmating season and in the
   postparturition season, sexes did not differ in body mass. Females had a
   significantly higher body mass than males in August and November,
   indicating pregnancy, which together with the presence of small infants
   in October and November implies that gravidity in females lasted for
   about 4-5 mo. All litters consisted of singletons. Individuals with body
   mass at the lower limit of the population either did not develop
   measurable testes volumes (males) or were not in estrus (females). They
   were probably juveniles from the previous birth season that achieved
   sexual maturity not before their second year after birth. The first data
   on reproduction suggest a low reproduction rate for Lepilemur edwardsi
   and a request for a higher conservation status than previously
   attributed and the need for further management strategies.},

Title = {Unexpected species diversity of Malagasy primates (Lepilemur spp.) in
   the same biogeographical zone: a morphological and molecular approach
   with the description of two new species},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Background: The lemurs of Madagascar provide an excellent mammalian
   radiation to explore mechanisms and processes favouring species
   diversity and evolution. Species diversity, in particular of nocturnal
   species, increased considerably during the last decade. However, the
   factors contributing to this high diversity are not well understood. We
   tested predictions derived from two existing biogeographic models by
   exploring the genetic and morphological divergence among populations of
   a widely distributed lemur genus, the sportive lemur (Lepilemur ssp.)
   along a 560 km long transect from western to northern Madagascar.
   Results: By using the phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA sequence data,
   molecular diagnostic sites and phenotypic morphometric traits, we
   uncovered two previously undetected species whose distributions
   contradict the two existing biogeographic models. Brief species
   descriptions are provided and a new biogeographic model is proposed (
   the ``large river model{''}).
   Conclusion: According to the ``large river model{''}, large rivers in
   north and northwestern Madagascar acted as geographical barriers for
   gene flow and facilitated speciation events on a much smaller spatial
   scale than previously thought. Thereby, this study does not only show
   that species diversity in nocturnal Malagasy primates is continuously
   underestimated but aims to emphasize the need for conservation actions
   if those species with small ranges shall not face extinction in the near
   future.},

Title = {Influence of reproductive season and rank on fecal glucocorticoid levels

Journal = {HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {51},
Number = {5},
Pages = {640-648},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Studies in anthropoid primates and other mammals suggest that
   reproductive season, rank, reproductive skew, aggression received, and
   social support are the major factors influencing glucocorticoid output.
   In which way these are also affecting adrenal function in lemurid
   primates has been studied rarely. Here, we examine the influence of
   reproductive season and rank on glucocorticoid output in male sifakas
   (Propithecus verreauxi), a species characterized by high breeding
   seasonality, a hierarchy among males and extreme reproductive skew
   towards dominant males. We established a fecal assay for non-invasively
   monitoring adrenal activity and collected 315 fecal samples during the
   reproductive and birth season from 10 male sifakas living in 5 groups in
   Western Madagascar. We found a significant effect of season on
   glucocorticoid output, with males exhibiting higher fecal glucocorticoid
   levels during the reproductive compared to the birth season in
   conjunction with an increase in overall aggression rates during the
   former period. Moreover, our data indicate a significant effect of rank
   on adrenocortical activity with dominant males exhibiting higher
   glucocorticoid levels than subordinate males in the reproductive season.
   However, dominant males did not differ significantly in rates of
   initiated or received aggression and rates of affiliative behavior from
   subordinates but showed significantly lower rates of submission. Given
   their highly formalized dominance relationships, we conclude that higher
   glucocorticoid output in dominant males during the 4-month reproductive
   season is likely related to higher energetic demands necessary to cope
   with the challenges of male reproduction rather than to physical demands
   of increased fighting frequency to maintain dominance status. High rank
   in sifakas may thus carry high costs, which, however, may be outweighed
   by monopolization of almost all paternities. In sum, our data generally
   support the findings on the relationship between environmental and
   social factors and glucocorticoid output found in non-lemurid primates.

Abstract = {Female social dominance is rare in mammals, but common in lemurs. We
   investigated social dominance in two Eulemur species; the polygynous
   crowned lemur (E. coronatus) and the monogamous red-bellied lemur (E.
   rubriventer), using four and two social groups, respectively. We
   collected data on agonistic interactions and two types of affiliative
   behavior (grooming and maintaining spatial proximity). We used a
   combination of focal watches of individuals, instantaneous scan-sampling
   of groups, and all-occurrence of some behaviors in groups. We found that
   overall rates of agonistic interactions were higher in E. coronatus, and
   they also had more decided intersexual agonistic interactions than E.
   rubriventer. However, in both species the females won the vast majority
   of these agonistic interactions. E. coronatus females were groomed more
   often by males than vice versa, whereas no sex differences in grooming
   were observed in E. rubriventer. We found that males were responsible
   for maintaining spatial proximity in E. coronatus whereas in E.
   rubriventer, females were responsible. In one group of E. coronatus, the
   mate was overweight and dominant to the female and this is the first
   observation of male dominance in a lemur species typically described as
   female dominant. We suggest that body weights in captivity be monitored
   for maintaining normal dominance relationships. Overall, agonistic
   behaviors were consistent with clear female social dominance in both E.
   coronatus and E. rubriventer. The affiliative behaviors also provided
   clear evidence for female dominance E. coronatus, but not for E.
   rubriventer.},

Abstract = {Very little is known about how nocturnal primates find their food. Here
   we studied the sensory basis of food perception in wild-caught gray
   mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) in Madagascar. Mouse lemurs feed
   primarily on fruit and arthropods. We established a set of behavioral
   experiments to assess food detection in wild-born, field-experienced
   mouse lemurs in short-term captivity. Specifically, we investigated
   whether they use visual, auditory, and motion cues to find and to
   localize prey arthropods and further whether olfactory cues are
   sufficient for finding fruit. Visual cues from motionless arthropod
   dummies were not sufficient to allow reliable detection of prey in
   choice experiments, nor did they trigger prey capture behavior when
   presented on the feeding platform. In contrast, visual motion cues from
   moving prey dummies attracted their attention. Behavioral observations
   and experiments with live and recorded insect rustling sounds indicated
   that the lemurs make use of prey-generated acoustic cues for foraging.
   Both visual motion cues and acoustic prey stimuli on their own were
   sufficient to trigger approach and capture behavior in the mouse lemurs.
   For the detection of fruit, choice experiments showed that olfactory
   information was sufficient for mouse lemurs to find a piece of banana.
   Our study provides the first experimental data on the sensory ecology of
   food detection in mouse lemurs. Further research is necessary to address
   the role of sensory ecology for food selection and possibly for niche
   differentiation between sympatric Microcebus species.},

Title = {Comparison of hind limb muscle mass in neonate and adult prosimian
   primates},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},
Pages = {231-242},

Abstract = {Little ontogenetic data exist to indicate whether muscular organization
   of neonates reflects adult locomotion (e.g., leaping) or infant
   activities like clinging or the initial quadrupedal phase of locomotion
   that typifies most infant primates. In the present study, five species
   of primates with contrasting modes of locomotion were examined.
   Twenty-eight preserved neonatal and adult cadavers were studied by
   careful dissection of the hip, thigh, and leg muscles. Wet weights were
   taken of limb muscles after removal, and the muscles were combined into
   major functional groups (e.g., flexors, extensors) of each limb segment.
   Results demonstrate that the distribution of muscle mass within the
   thigh and within the leg are similar between neonates and adults for all
   species, with major groups varying by 5\% or less in all but two age
   comparisons. Crural indices of the neonates are nearly identical to
   those of the adults, but leg/thigh muscle mass ratios were higher in the
   neonates. Species vary greatly in the percentage of adult limb segment
   muscle mass present in neonates, with Tarsius syrichta having the
   greatest percentage for all segments and two lemurids showing the least.
   These results primarily track differences in relative body mass at birth
   rather than developmental differences. The adaptive distribution of
   muscle, as discussed previously for adult prosimians, appears to be
   established at birth. Neonates of leaping species already have much
   larger quadriceps muscles than quadrupeds. Differences between large-
   and small-bodied leapers (e.g., pronounced superficial plantarflexor
   masses in tarsiers and pronounced deep plantarflexor masses in sifakas)
   also are present in neonates. Ratios of muscle mass over body mass are
   smaller in all neonates than in their adult counterparts, suggesting
   that the neonates are relatively poorly muscled, and that muscle mass
   must increase with positive allometry during growth. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Title = {Ecological and phylogenetic correlates to body size in the Indriidae},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},

Volume = {28},

Pages = {183-210},

Abstract = {I investigated ecological and phylogenetic correlates to body size
   variations in 10 taxa of extant Indriidae (Indri, Avahi, and
   Propithecus). I also tested for phylogenetic niche conservatism as a
   model for the evolution of indriid body size. Phylogenetic niche
   conservatism refers to the shared attributes that related taxa have
   acquired because they tend to have occupied similar niches during their
   evolutionary history. I collected species-specific data on body mass,
   climate, density, and chemical properties of food items from the
   literature. I used 2 phylogenies in independent contrasts methods to
   control for phylogenetic relationships (Indri and Propithecus as sister
   taxa vs. Indri basal taxa to all indriids). Multivariate models
   indicated that lemur density and resource quality are the strongest
   ecological correlates to indriid body size variations. Partitioning
   methods revealed that 52.4-67\% of indriid body size variation is
   explained by phylogenetic niche conservation. Thus, indriid body size
   variations may be the result of stabilizing selection. Though it is
   possible to identify constraints on lower than average body size, there
   are few data on selection against larger than average body size in
   indriids. Large body size in subfossil lemurs further complicates
   identification of constraints on larger than average body size in extant
   indriids. Researchers using independent contrast methods to control for
   phylogeny should be aware that some ecology-phenotype relationships are
   best explained as the result of the synergistic effects of ecology and
   phylogeny.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {69},

Abstract = {The phylogeny of the Afro-Asian Lorisoidea is controversial. While
   postcranial data attest strongly to the monophyly of the Lorisidae, most
   molecular analyses portray them as paraphyletic and group the Galagidae
   alternately with the Asian or African lorisids. One of the problems that
   has bedevilled phylogenetic analysis of the group in the past is the
   limited number of taxa sampled for both ingroup families. We present the
   results of a series of phylogenetic analyses based on 635 base pairs
   (bp) from two mitochondrial genes (12S and 16S rRNA) with and without 36
   craniodental characters, for 11 galagid and five lorisid taxa. The
   outgroup was the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). Analyses of the
   molecular data included maximum parsimony (MP), neighbor joining (NJ),
   maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian methods. The model-based analyses
   and the combined ``molecules+ morphology{''} analyses supported
   monophyly of the Lorisidae and Galagidae. The lorisids form two
   geographically defined clades. We find no support for the taxonomy of
   Galagidae as proposed recently by Groves {[}Primate Taxonomy,
   Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press. 350 p, 2001]. The
   taxonomy of Nash et al. {[}International Journal of Primatology
   10:57-80, 1989] is supported by the combined ``molecules+ morphology{''}
   analysis; however, the model-based analyses suggest that Galagoides may
   be an assemblage of species united by plesiomorphic craniodental
   characters.},

Title = {Incongruence between genetic and morphological diversity in Microcebus
   griseorufus of Beza Mahafaly},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Background: The past decade has seen a remarkable increase in the number
   of recognized mouse lemur species ( genus Microcebus). As recently as
   1994, only two species of mouse lemur were recognized according to the
   rules of zoological nomenclature. That number has now climbed to as many
   as fifteen proposed species. Indeed, increases in recognized species
   diversity have also characterized other nocturnal primates - galagos,
   sportive lemurs, and tarsiers. Presumably, the movement relates more to
   a previous lack of information than it does to any recent proclivity for
   taxonomic splitting. Due to their nocturnal habits, one can hypothesize
   that mouse lemurs will show only minimal variation in pelage coloration
   as such variation should be inconsequential for the purposes of mate
   and/ or species recognition. Even so, current species descriptions for
   nocturnal strepsirrhines place a good deal of emphasis on relatively
   fine distinctions in pelage coloration.
   Results: Here, we report results from a multi- year study of mouse lemur
   populations from Beza Mahafaly in southern Madagascar. On the basis of
   morphological and pelage variation, we initially hypothesized the
   presence of up to three species of mouse lemurs occurring sympatrically
   at this locality, one of which appeared to be undescribed. Genetic
   analysis reveals definitively, however, that all three color morphs
   belong to a single recognized species, Microcebus griseorufus. Indeed,
   in some cases, the three color morphs can be characterized by identical
   mitochondrial haplotypes.
   Conclusion: Given these results, we conclude that investigators should
   always proceed with caution when using a single data source to identify
   novel species. A synthetic approach that combines morphological,
   genetic, geographic, and ecological data is most likely to reveal the
   true nature of species diversity.},

Journal = {ETHOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {112},
Number = {9},
Pages = {839-849},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this study, we compared the usage of alarm calls and anti-predator
   strategies between a captive and a wild lemur population. The wild lemur
   population was studied earlier in Western Madagascar (Fichtel \&
   Kappeler 2002). The captive population was studied in outdoor enclosures
   of the Duke University Primate Center. Alarm calls and anti-predator
   behavior were elicited by conducting experiments with both vocal and
   visual dummies. We scored the subjects' immediate behavioral responses,
   including alarm calls, from video recordings made during the
   experiments. In principle, both populations have a mixed alarm call
   system with functionally referential alarm calls for aerial predators
   and general alarm calls for terrestrial and aerial predators and for
   situations associated with high arousal, such as group encounters.
   Although wild and captive sifakas exhibit the same alarm call system and
   use the same alarm call types, we discovered striking differences in the
   usage and perception of some of the alarm calls. We argue that these
   differences indicate either an evolutionary drift in the meaning of
   these calls or reflect cultural variation. The latter possibility is
   consistent with our understanding of the ontogeny of call usage and
   comprehension.},

Abstract = {Deficits in autonomic thermoregulatory capacities have been identified
   in aged humans and animals, but little is known about the effect of
   aging on behavioral thermoregulation and the potential effect of season.
   Preferred ambient temperature (T.) in a thermal gradient (available
   T(a)s from 10 to 30 degrees C) was measured in the mouse lemur, a
   nocturnal Malagasy primate. Male mouse lemurs (40 adults and 40 aged)
   were studied under short (SP, resting season) and long photoperiod (LP,
   breeding season). Additionally, daily body temperature rhythm was
   telemetrically recorded in 30 individuals of both age categories. In
   adults exposed to SP, a choice for warm climates was observed, with a
   mean diurnal T-a of 26 degrees C. Day-night differences in selected Ta
   occurred only in animals exposed to SP. In LP, selection of a warm
   environment did not seem to be a necessary factor for maintenance of
   normothermia. Aged animals selected warmer Ts than adults during the
   night like during the day, whatever the photoperiod. In relation to
   changes in body temperature rhythm according to age, aged animals would
   select warmer environments possibly to compensate autonomic
   deficiencies. Further studies on age-related changes in hormonal and
   cellular functions involved in energy balance and thermoregulation will
   help decipher the causes of insufficient responses to thermal stress
   observed in the elderly. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Lactation imposes substantial physiological costs on mothers and should
   therefore not be directed towards foreign offspring. Such allonursing,
   however, is common in mammal species that share roosts. Hypotheses to
   explain allonursing among such plural breeders include misdirected
   parental care, milk evacuation, brood parasitism, reciprocity, and kin
   selection. The necessary behavioral data, in combination with data on
   kinship and kin recognition, have rarely been available to distinguish
   among these explanations, however. In this study, we provide evidence
   for cooperative nursing and adoption by plural-breeding females in a
   nocturnal primate, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), in which
   females forage solitarily during the night, but form day-time sleeping
   groups with one to two other females. We observed 34 resident females in
   an 8 ha study area in Kirindy Forest, Madagascar, over three consecutive
   annual breeding seasons and determined genetic relationships among all
   members of this population. Five sleeping groups of adult females were
   filmed inside their roosts during one breeding season after females gave
   birth. The composition of groups changed substantially across years, but
   they always consisted of close maternal relatives. All females within a
   group gave birth to one to three infants. They regularly transferred
   only their own offspring among roosting sites, demonstrating an ability
   to discriminate between their own and other's offspring, but they
   regularly groomed and nursed related offspring other than their own and
   adopted related dependent young after their mother's death. Kin
   selection may therefore be the main selective force behind cooperative
   breeding among these closely related females with a high mortality risk,
   providing each of them with family insurance.},

   Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) to analyze
   different morphological aspects of the jaw and teeth. Although partially
   preserved, this fossil mandible reveals a set of distinctive dental
   traits (e.g., double-rooted P-2 and molarized P-4) that allow us to
   describe a new stepsirrhine adapiform: Muangthanhinius siami, new genus
   and species. This taxon is somewhat atypical among Paleogene adapiforms,
   and more specialized than the sivaladapid adapiforms (hoanghoniines)
   that existed in Asia in the same epoch. In fact, Muangthanhinius shows a
   degree of dental specialization approximating that of some modern
   strepsirrhine lemuriforms, although it lacks the highly specialized
   anterior dentition characterizing this living primate group (canine +
   incisors forming a very procumbent toothcomb). In contrast,
   Muangthanhinius exhibits a large canine deeply anchored within the
   dentary that probably protruded high above the toothrow. Finally,
   despite the development of a molarized P-4 as in Miocene sivaladapid
   sivaladapines, Muangthanhinius differs in molar morphology from this
   group, and the position of this new taxon within the Adapiformes remains
   indeterminate. Clarification of its phylogenetic position will require
   more morphological evidence than is currently available.},

Abstract = {According to optimal foraging theory, herbivores can base food choice
   mainly on the quality or the quantity of food, or both. Among
   herbivorous primates, folivorous lemurs living in the highly seasonal
   environment of Madagascar have to cope with the shortage of high-quality
   food during the dry season, at least in deciduous forests. We studied
   (Verreaux's sifaka) in Kirindy, western Madagascar, to understand the
   influence of dry season and food quality and quantity on behavioral
   patterns and feeding strategy (qualitative vs. quantitative dietary
   choice) of a folivorous lemur in a deciduous forest. We followed 7
   groups (4 groups/period; 3 individuals/group/month) during 4 periods of
   the year (wet season: February-March; early/middle/late dry season:
   May-June; July-September; October-November). We collected samples of
   plants eaten and examined behavioral and feeding patterns, considering
   food quality (macronutrients, proteins/fibers ratio, and tannins) and
   abundance. We found 1) a significant reduction of home range, core area,
   and daily path length from the wet to the dry season, possibly related
   to dietary change and 2) a daily period of inactivity in the dry season
   for energy conservation. Regarding the feeding strategy, Kirindy sifakas
   showed 1) high variation and selection in choosing food items and 2) a
   dietary choice based mainly on quality: Kirindy sifakas fed on plant
   species/families independently from their abundance and tannins
   represented a feeding deterrent during the dry season. Overall,
   behavioral and dietary adaptations allow Kirindy sifakas to overcome the
   shortage of high-quality food in the lean period.},

Abstract = {Many services generated by forest ecosystems provide essential support
   for human well-being. However, the vulnerability of these services to
   environmental change such as forest fragmentation are still poorly
   understood. We present spatial modeling of the generation of ecosystem
   services in a human-dominated landscape where forest habitat patches,
   protected by local taboos, are located in a matrix of cultivated land in
   southern Madagascar. Two ecosystem services dependent on the forest
   habitats were addressed: (1) crop pollination services by wild and
   semidomesticated bees (Apoidea), essential for local crop production of,
   for example, beans, and (2) seed dispersal services based on the
   presence of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). We studied the
   vulnerability of these ecosystem services to a plausible scenario of
   successive destruction of the smallest habitat patches. Our results
   indicate that, in spite of the fragmented nature of the landscape, the
   fraction of the landscape presently covered by both crop pollination and
   seed dispersal services is surprisingly high. It seems that the taboo
   system, though indirectly and unintentionally, contributes to upholding
   the generation of these services by protecting the forest patches. Both
   services are, however, predicted to be very vulnerable to the successive
   removal of small patches. For crop pollination, the rate of decrease in
   cover was significant even when only the smallest habitat patches were
   removed. The capacity for seed dispersal across the landscape displayed
   several thresholds with habitat patch removal. Our results suggest that,
   in order to maintain capacity for seed dispersal across the landscape
   and crop pollination cover in southern Androy, the geographical location
   of the remaining forest patches is more crucial than their size. We
   argue that in heavily fragmented production landscapes, small forest
   patches should increasingly be viewed as essential for maintaining
   ecosystem services, such as agricultural production, and also should be
   considered in the ongoing process of tripling the area of protected
   habitats in Madagascar.},

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {I investigated sexual differences in activity levels, and their adaptive
   significance in gray mouse lemurs, Microcebus murinus, during the dry
   season. I studied them between April and September, 1999, at Kirindy
   Forest, a dry deciduous forest in western Madagascar. Six males and 6
   females were radiocollared and followed using focal individual sampling.
   The males remained active throughout the dry season, whereas the females
   hibernated for up to 3 mo. Males exhibited a gradual decrease in
   activity from May to June and some of them remained inactive for periods
   of a few days to 1 wk. Males were more active in July. Though there were
   changes in the duration of time spent sleeping, there was no significant
   change in male body mass throughout the period. Males appear to prefer
   to rest in nests that are close to or coincident with those preferred by
   females, and multiple males may simultaneously share nests with multiple
   hibernating females. Males occupying nests that are close to or
   coincident with nests preferred by females tend to switch nests less
   frequently than others do. Researchers have suggested that high levels
   of activity prepare males for the mating season, which occurs at the end
   of the dry season. Presumably, by maintaining an active lifestyle
   throughout the dry season, certain males may position themselves to
   monopolize the best tree holes during the mating season. The
   reproductive advantages gained by this behavior may overshadow the costs
   of remaining active during the dry season when resources are scarce,
   temperatures are low, and predator pressure is high. Measurements on
   captured males confirm a weak (nonsignificant) positive correlation
   between body mass and activity levels. There is no indication that the
   heavier, more active males were better able to monopolize the best tree
   holes.},

Abstract = {We report on the first reciprocal chromosome painting of lorisoids and
   humans. The chromosome painting showed a remarkable syntenic homology
   between Otolemur and Nycticebus. Eight derived syntenic associations of
   human segments are common to both Otolemur and Nycticebus, indicative of
   a considerable period of common evolution between the greater galago and
   the slow loris. Five additional Robertsonian translocations form the
   slow loris karyotype, while the remaining chromosomes are syntenically
   equivalent, although some differ in terms of centromere position and
   heterochromatin additions. Strikingly, the breakpoints of the human
   chromosomes found fragmented in these two species are apparently
   identical. Only fissions of homologs to human chromosomes 1 and 15
   provide significant evidence of a cytogenetic link between Lemuriformes
   and Lorisiformes. The association of human chromosomes 7/16 in both
   lorisoids strongly suggests that this chromosome was present in the
   ancestral primate genome.},

Abstract = {In humans, activity rhythms become fragmented and attenuated in the
   elderly. This suggests an alteration of the circadian system per se that
   could in turn affect the expression of biological rhythms. In primates,
   very few studies have analyzed the effect of aging on the circadian
   system. The mouse lemur provides a unique model of aging in non-human
   primates. To assess the effect of aging on the circadian system of this
   primate, we recorded the circadian and daily rhythms of locomotor
   activity of mouse lemurs of various ages. We also examined age-related
   changes in the daily rhythm of immunoreactivities for vasoactive
   intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) in
   suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons (SCN), two major peptides of the
   biological clock. Compared to adult animals, aged mouse lemurs showed a
   significant increase in daytime activity and an advanced activity onset.
   Moreover, when maintained in constant dim red light, aged animals
   exhibited a shortening of the free-running period compared to adult
   animals. In adults, AVP immunoreactivity (ir) peaked during the second
   part of the day, and VIP ir peaked during the night. In aged mouse
   lemurs, the peaks of AVP ir and VIP ir were significantly shifted with
   no change in amplitude. AVP ir was most intense at the beginning of the
   night; whereas, VIP ir peaked at the beginning of the daytime. A
   weakened oscillator could account for the rhythmic disorders often
   observed in the elderly. Changes in the daily rhythms of AVP ir and VIP
   ir may affect the ability of the SCN to transmit rhythmic information to
   other neural target sites, and thereby modify the expression of some
   biological rhythms.},

Title = {A re-evaluation of the role of vision in the activity and communication

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {77},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {50-71},
Note = {1st Forum on Cathemerality, Turin, ITALY, 2004},
Abstract = {This paper examines the importance of vision in the lives of nocturnal
   primates in comparison to diurnal and cathemeral species. Vision is the
   major sense in all primates and there is evidence that the eyesight of
   nocturnal species is more acute and variable than has previously been
   recognized. Case studies of the behaviour of a galago and a loris in
   open woodland habitats in relation to ambient light show that Galago
   moholi males are more likely to travel between clumps of vegetation
   along the ground when the moon is up, and during periods of twilight,
   whereas they retreat to more continuous vegetation and travel less when
   the moon sets. This is interpreted as a strategy for avoiding predators
   that hunt on the ground when it is dark. The travel distances of Loris
   lydekkerianus are not affected by moonlight but this species reduces its
   choice of food items from more mobile prey to mainly ants when the moon
   sets, indicating the importance of light when searching for high-energy
   supplements to its staple diet. Evidence is presented for the first time
   to indicate key aspects of nocturnal vision that would benefit from
   further research. It is suggested that the light and dark facial
   markings of many species convey information about species and individual
   identity when animals approach each other at night. Differences in the
   colour of the reflective eye-shine, and behavioural responses displayed
   when exposed to white torchlight, point to different kinds of nocturnal
   vision that are suited to each niche, including the possibility of some
   degree of colour discrimination. The ability of even specialist
   nocturnal species to see well in broad daylight demonstrates an inherent
   flexibility that would enable movement into diurnal niches. The major
   differences in the sensitivity and perceptual anatomy of diurnal lemurs
   compared to diurnal anthropoids, and the emergence of cathemerality in
   lemurs, is interpreted as a reflection of evolution from different
   ancestral stocks in very different ecosystems, and not a recent shift
   towards diurnality due to human disturbance. Copyright (c) 2006 S.

Abstract = {We present data on feeding patterns in Avahi laniger and compare these
   data to temporal variations in leaf chemistry. Because A. laniger is one
   of the smallest folivorous primates and has a monogastric stomach, we
   hypothesized that this lemur would display behavioural adaptations to a
   leaf-based diet by scheduling feeding times when leaves were of highest
   quality. Data were collected from May to August 2004 at the Vatoharanana
   site in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. A. laniger fed during
   different time periods despite leaf carbohydrate and protein
   concentrations exhibiting little variation throughout the night.
   Although tannin concentrations exhibited temporal fluctuations, they did
   not covary with A. laniger feeding times. We suggest that A. laniger
   feeding times cannot be explained entirely by variations in leaf
   chemistry. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

Abstract = {Mammals that live in seasonal environments may adjust their reproductive
   cycles to COPE! with fluctuations in food availability. Because lemurs
   in Madagascar experience highly seasonal variation in food availability,
   we examined the effects of fluctuating food availability on body
   condition and reproduction in one of the larger living species,
   Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi), in the Kirindy
   Forest of western Madagascar. Seven years of demographic data were
   combined with an intensive study of 25 individuals over the course of 18
   months. In contrast to other populations of Verreaux's sifaka, females
   were found to have greater body mass than males. Both male and female
   sifaka exhibited significant losses of body mass and fat during the dry
   season. Females were more likely to give birth and successfully wean an
   infant when they had higher body mass during the mating season. They
   mated during the periods of high and declining food availability, gave
   birth during the lean season, and then timed mid/late lactation with the
   period of increasing food availability. Thus, we conclude that sifaka
   follow the ``classic{''} reproductive strategy (sensu van Schaik and win

Abstract = {The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), a prosimian primate, exhibits
   seasonal rhythms strictly controlled by photoperiodic variations.
   Previous studies indicated that longevity can be altered by long-term
   acceleration of seasonal rhythms, providing a model for assessing
   various aspects of aging. To assess the effect of aging and accelerated
   aging on the circadian system of this primate, we compared the circadian
   rhythm of the locomotor activity in adult mouse lemurs (2-4.5 years, n =
   9), aged mouse lemurs (5-9 years, n = 10), and adult mouse lemurs that
   had been exposed from birth to a shortened seasonal photoperiodic cycle
   (2-4.5 years, n = 7). Compared to adult animals, aged mouse lemurs
   showed a significant increase in intradaily variability and an advanced
   activity onset. Aging was characterized by a decrease in amplitude, with
   both a decrease in nocturnal activity and an increase in daytime
   activity. When maintained in constant dim red light, aged animals
   exhibited a shortening of the free-running period (22.8 +/- 0.1 h)
   compared to adult animals (23.5 +/- 0.1 h). A 3- to 5-year exposure to
   an accelerated seasonal photoperiodic rhythm ({''}annual{''} duration of
   5 months) in accelerated mouse lemurs produced disturbances of the
   locomotor activity rhythm that resembled those of aged mouse lemurs,
   whether animals were studied in entrained or in free-running conditions.
   The present study demonstrated a weakened and fragmented locomotor
   activity rhythm during normal aging in this primate. Increasing the
   number of expressed seasonal cycles accelerated aging of parameters
   related to circadian rhythmicity in adult animals.},

Abstract = {The intensity of available light is important in determining how well a
   diurnal animal can distinguish color. Primates with different types of
   color vision may exhibit behaviors that maximize visual contrast during
   critical activities such as feeding. We hypothesized that (1)
   trichromatic taxa will feed in a wide range of light conditions because
   color constancy permits stabilized color appearance across changes in
   illumination, and (2) that taxa with a high proportion of dichromatic
   individuals will tend to feed at higher light levels to increase color
   contrast. We recorded light levels during feeding bouts of seven primate
   taxa with varying degrees of color vision: the dichromatic Lemur catta,
   two polymorphic species, Propithecus v. verreauxi and Ateles geoffroyi,
   and the routine trichromats, Alouatta palliata, Colobus guereza,
   Piliocolobus badius, and Cercopithecus ascanius. Results were equivocal
   for our hypotheses. While routinely trichromatic taxa used varying light
   levels, the pattern of results did not differ from the dichromatic Lemur
   catta. However, polymorphic taxa not only sought the highest light, but
   females, which are the only individuals in polymorphic taxa that can be
   trichromatic, fed in higher light levels than males when eating
   non-green foods. This result is consistent with selection operating to
   maintain a balanced polymorphism in these taxa, though the connection
   between light levels and color vision type for the females is unclear.
   Our results further suggest that trichromatic vision may afford a
   selective advantage because it permits foraging under a greater range of
   light levels.},

Abstract = {The late Eocene prosimian Wadilemur elegans from the Jebel Qatrani
   Formation, northern Egypt, was originally interpreted as an anchomornyin
   aclapiform primate based on limited information from the lower molars
   and distal premolars. Recently recovered fossils attributable to this
   species, including a proximal femur, the fourth upper premolar and first
   and second upper molars, and a mandible preserving the lower second
   premolar and lower canine and incisor alveoli, reveal a number of
   derived morphological similarities shared with crown strepsirrhines and,
   in particular, Miocene-to-Recent stem and crown galagids, to the
   exclusion of known adapiforms. Phylogenetic analysis of 359
   morphological features scored across 95 living and extinct crown primate
   taxa supports a stem galagid placement for Wadilemur and older
   Saharagalago, and a close relationship between crown strepsirrhines and
   the Eocene African taxa ``Anchomomys{''} milleri, Dje-belemur, and
   Plesiopithecus (none of which appear to be closely related to European
   anchomomyins). This scheme of relationships supports the hypothesis that
   crown Strepsirrhini is of Afro-Arabian origin and that lemuriforms
   likely colonized Madagascar by crossing the Mozambique Channel.
   Wadilemur's known dental and postcranial morphology provides additional
   support for the hypothesis that galagids and lorisids had diverged by
   the close of the middle Eocene, and, by bolstering the approximate to 37
   million-year-old calibration point for crown lorisiform origins provided
   by Saharagalago, indirect support for the hypothesis of an ancient
   origin of crown Strepsirrhini and crown Primates.},

Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {903-919},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Pair-living evolved several times independently in the primate lineage
   and most likely for more than one reason. Currently, there are 7
   hypotheses regarding the evolution of pair-living in primates. They may
   explain several but not all cases. I investigated the applicability of
   the explanations to fork-marked lemurs Phaner furcifer. I used
   information from a long-term study on 8 fork-marked lemur families in
   Kirindy Forest to evaluate the hypotheses. Fork-marked lemurs live in
   uniform dispersed pairs, which share and defend a territory but spend
   three-quarters of their activity time apart from each other.
   Unconditional female dominance and lack of permanent close association
   between pair-partners disqualify most hypotheses. Lack of male parental
   care and long travel distances in small home ranges disqualify other
   explanations. I conclude that there is no support a priori for any
   current pair-living hypothesis and that the newly formulated
   intersexual-feeding-competition hypothesis best explains the evolution
   of pair-living in fork-marked lemurs. Accordingly, female range
   exclusivity evolved first as a consequence of intense feeding
   competition. Subsequently, indirect feeding competition drove females to
   accept a single male to share their territory as a defense against
   feeding competition from males whose ranges unsystematically overlap
   those of several females. This situation led to pair-living because
   formation of dispersed one-male-multifemale-units was too costly for
   males in terms of reduced foraging efficiency.},

Title = {Molar scaling in strepsirrhine primates},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {49},
Number = {2},
Pages = {241-269},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We examined how maxillary molar dimensions change with body and skull
   size estimates among 54 species of living and subfossil strepsirrhine
   primates. Strepsirrhine maxillary molar areas tend to scale with
   negative allometry, or possibly isometry, relative to body mass. This
   observation supports several previous scaling analyses showing that
   primate molar areas scale at or slightly below geometric similarity
   relative to body mass. Strepsirrhine molar areas do (0.75) not change
   relative to body mass, as predicted by the metabolic scaling hypothesis.
   Relative to basicranial length, maxillary molar areas tend to scale with
   positive allometry. Previous claims that primate molar areas scale with
   positive allometry relative to body mass appear to rest on the incorrect
   assumption that skull dimensions scale isometrically with body mass.
   We identified specific factors that help us to better understand these
   observed scaling patterns. Lorisiform and lemuriform maxillary molar
   scaling patterns did not differ significantly, suggesting that the two
   infraorders had little independent influence on strepsirrhine scaling
   patterns. Contrary to many previous studies of primate dental allometry,
   we found little evidence for significant differences in molar area
   scaling patterns among frugivorous, folivorous, and insectivorous
   groups. We were able to distinguish folivorous species from frugivorous
   and insectivorous taxa, by comparing M-1 lengths and widths. Folivores
   tend to have a mesiodistally elongated M-1 for a given buccolingual M-1
   width when compared to the other two dietary groups. It has recently
   been shown that brain mass has a strong influence on primate dental
   eruption rates. We extended this comparison to relative maxillary molar
   sizes, but found that brain mass appears to have little influence oil
   the size of strepsirrhine molars. Alternatively, we observed a strong
   correlation between the relative size of the facial skull and relative
   molar areas among strepsirrhines. We hypothesize that this association
   may be underlain by a partial sharing of the patterning of development
   between molar and facial skull elements. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

   with age-related decrease in amplitude. From 8 month- to 11-year-old
   males (N = 175), plasma DHEA-S levels were measured either during the
   breeding season or during the winter sexual rest. Plasma DHEA-S levels
   show high significant changes according to season and age. During
   winter, DHEA-S levels were maintained low and constant over lifetime.
   During the summer breeding season, a decline of DHEA-S levels occurred
   after the age of 3 years and accelerated after the age of 6 years.
   DHEA-S level was about 30-40\% of its adult value with age over 6 years,
   a stepwise pattern most closely resembling to human pattern. In mouse
   lemur, DHEA-S met the criteria for a biomarker of aging. When correlated
   to other age-related changes, the. results give the opportunity to
   consider the mouse lemur as a promising primate model to study aging
   processes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Our goal was to provide a first characterization of the social system of
   pygmy mouse lemurs (Microcebus berthae), the world - smallest primate
   species. During a 4-mo field study of 12 females and 27 males, we
   combined capture-recapture and morphometric data with detailed
   behavioral observations of individually marked subjects and genetic
   paternity analyses of a population in Kirindy Forest, western
   Madagascar. We describe the social organization of Microcebus berthae as
   a solitary forager living in an individualized neighborhood system
   characterized by extensive intra- and intersexual home range overlap of
   adult individuals within a male-biased population. Male and female pygmy
   mouse lemurs inhabited home ranges (males: 4.9 ha; females: 2.5 ha) that
   are more than twice as large as those of sympatric Microcebus murinus.
   On average, pygmy mouse lemurs of both sexes spent about half of the
   days sleeping alone. Preliminary analysis of genetic population
   structure suggests female philopatry and male dispersal. Sleeping
   associations of variable composition that consisted not preferentially
   of close relatives and proximity during part of the nightly activity
   contributed together with regular social interactions to the maintenance
   of a social network. The spatial distribution pattern of adult males and
   females, the absence of sexual size dimorphism, relatively large male
   testicular volume and moderate female estrous synchrony suggest a
   promiscuous mating system with a high potential for scramble
   competition. In general, there are many similarities between the social
   system of Microcebus berthae and those of other Microcebus spp. However,
   striking differences with sympatric gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   murinus) in female home range size, dispersion and sleeping behavior
   indicate the existence of species-specific socioecological adaptations
   in closely related species occupying very similar ecological niches.},

Abstract = {The Malagasy primate Cheirogaleus medius hibernates in tree holes for 7
   months, although ambient temperatures during hibernation rise above 30
   degrees C in their natural environment. In a field study we show that
   during hibernation the body temperature of most lemurs fluctuates
   between about 10 degrees C and 30 degrees C, closely tracking the
   diurnal fluctuations of ambient temperature passively. These lemurs do
   not interrupt hibernation by spontaneous arousals, previously thought to
   be obligatory for all mammalian hibernators. However, some lemurs
   hibernate in large trees, which provide better thermal insulation. Their
   body temperature fluctuates only little around 25 degrees C, but they
   show regular arousals, as known from temperate and arctic hibernators.
   The results from this study demonstrate that maximum body temperature is
   a key factor necessitating the occurrence of arousals. Furthermore, we
   show that hibernation is not necessarily coupled to low body temperature
   and, therefore, low body temperature should no longer be included in the
   definition of hibernation.},

Abstract = {Scent-marking behavior has been well documented in many primate species.
   Three common functions attributed to scent-marking in males of
   multi-male/multi-female lemur species include: 1) advertisement of
   individual identity, 2) territorial defense, and 3) reproductive
   suppression. We examined the average number of scent-marks per hour
   exhibited daily by adult male sifakas (Propithecus edwardsi) and found
   that patterns of scent-marking changed with season, natal status, and
   dominance status. Males in single-male groups scent-marked at the
   highest rate, followed by dominant males, males of equal status, and
   subordinate males. Non-natal males generally scent-marked at higher
   rates than natal males, and adult males living in a natal group without
   a parent marked at higher rates than males living with a parent. All
   males scent-marked at higher rates in the migration season compared to
   the other seasons. These patterns were consistent with territorial
   defense and advertisement to females, and the suggestion that these
   chemical signals impart information concerning status. Since
   scent-marking behavior tracked seasons and varied with both dominance
   and natal status, it may serve multiple functions in males. (C) 2005

Abstract = {In the Malagasy ecosystem one particular animal group, lemurs, have the
   greatest biomass and species richness of frugivores. The peak fruit
   production in the Malagasy rain forests is about three months shorter
   compared to peak fruit production in the Amazon and the African rain
   forests. This suggests that the environment in Madagascar has more
   well-defined constraints than other continental areas with primates. In
   Ranomafana National Park, both the overall number of trees, and the
   number of tree species producing fruit drops during winter months.
   Particularly in large-bodied lemurs such as sifakas, drop in fruit
   availability corresponds to an increase in leaf eating. In addition to
   dietary shifts, all lemur species appear to be able to deal with the
   season of scarce fruit availability by conserving energy. Extreme
   responses to winter season are seen in small-bodied lemurs which go into
   hibernation up to six months every year. Unlike many primate communities
   in other continents, lemurs do not have synchronous birth peaks across
   species. In Ranomafana sympatric lemurs show that while individuals
   within a species have synchronized births, across species lemurs have
   synchronized weaning. The weaning synchrony coincides with maximum fruit
   availability and production of small fruits peaks when small juvenile
   lemurs begin to forage independently. These patterns suggest that lemurs
   do not appear to rely on fruits to carry them over the period of food
   scarcity as would be expected from classical descriptions of keystone
   resources. Rather, we propose that lemurs as a guild rely on fruits as a
   keystone resource during the warm, wet months in order for lactation and
   weaning to succeed. Many of the fruit tree species used by lemurs are
   also hardwood species favored by selective loggers. While loss of these
   key fruit trees may not drive lemurs into extinction immediately, it may
   adversely affect reproductive success years after logging.},

Abstract = {Madagascar is characterised by pronounced annual climatic and ecological
   seasonality and harbours a radiation of closely related sympatric
   primates (Lemuriformes) that exhibit diurnal, nocturnal and cathemeral
   activity patterns. We collected continuous activity data over a complete
   annual cycle from wild diurnal Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus v.
   verreauxi) to contribute detailed and comparative data: (1) to
   characterise their diel and seasonal activity rhythms, (2) to identify
   factors shaping variation in activity rhythms, and (3) to help
   reconstruct the evolutionary transition from nocturnal to diurnal
   activity. We fitted eight adult sifakas from seven different groups
   living in Kirindy forest with an accelerometer/data logger device and
   recorded their activity in 5-min bins for a total of 12 months. We
   characterise P. verreauxi as a strictly diurnal species with a
   pronounced bimodal activity pattern that briefly changed to a more
   unimodal pattern during their annual mating season (January to March).
   We documented significant annual variation in total daily activity,
   activity time, and activity level, as well as in most parameters
   characterising their bimodal activity pattern. Despite a significant
   positive correlation of the animals' activity time with day length,
   pronounced annual variation in the phase position of onset and end of
   activity in relation to sunrise and sunset times could also be
   discerned. Minor enhancing effects of moonlight on nocturnal activity
   were only found for the first 3 h of the inactivity period. Bimodality
   of the activity pattern and the additional reduction of activity time
   during the cold and dry winter months associated with reduced food
   availability can be interpreted as flexible behavioural adaptations to
   reduce energy expenditure. We therefore propose that energetic and
   thermoregulatory benefits are important factors shaping these primates'
   activity pattern.},

Abstract = {In mammals with solitary females, the potential for males to monopolize
   matings is relatively low, and scramble competition polygyny is presumed
   to be the predominant mating system. However, combinations of male
   traits and mating tactics within this type of polygyny have been
   described. The main aim of our study was to identify the relative
   importance of, and interactions among, potential determinants of
   contrasting male reproductive tactics, and to determine their
   consequences for male reproductive success in a small solitary nocturnal
   Malagasy primate, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). We studied
   their mating behavior over three consecutive annual mating seasons. In
   addition, we determined the genetic relationships among more than 300
   study animals to quantify the reproductive success of individual males.
   We found that, with a given relatively low overall monopolization
   potential, successful male mouse lemurs roamed extensively in search of
   mates, had superior finding ability and mated as early as possible.
   However, contest competition was important too, as temporary
   monopolization was also possible. Males exhibited different mating
   tactics, and heavier males had a higher reproductive success, although
   most litters had mixed paternities. Switching between tactics depended
   on short-term local variation in monopolization potential determined by
   a pronounced dynamic in fertilization probability, number of alternative
   mating opportunities, and the operational sex ratio. This study also
   revealed that the dynamics of these determinants, as well as the mutual
   interactions between them, necessitate a detailed knowledge of the
   mating behavior of a species to infer the impact of determinants of
   alternative mating tactics.},

Abstract = {Sex-specific interests over the maximization of reproductive success
   lead to an inter-sexual conflict over the optimal mating system in a
   species. Traditionally, the outcome of this inter-sexual conflict has
   been studied from the male perspective but it also depends on female
   mating strategies, such as manipulating the temporal distribution of
   sexual activity, advertisement, and mate choice. We used a small
   nocturnal primate, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) to
   determine the relative importance of female mating strategies on the
   outcome of this conflict in a species where females are solitary during
   their activity period. We studied their mating behavior over three
   consecutive annual mating seasons and determined the genetic
   relationships among more than 300 study animals to quantify individual
   reproductive success. We found that most females were receptive
   asynchronously. Females did not exhibit any obvious direct mate choice,
   probably due to a highly male-biased operational sex ratio and the
   corresponding costs of choosiness. However, females exercised indirect
   choice for multiple matings. They mated with 1-7 males up to 11 times
   during their single night of receptivity. As a result, mixed paternity
   was common but heavier males sired more offspring, meaning that indirect
   female choice for superior males cannot be excluded. Females exhibited a
   mixed mating strategy, avoiding costly direct mate choice but still
   counteracting male efforts to monopolize mating, successfully increasing
   genetic variability among offspring. Thus, females had a major influence
   on the outcome of the inter-sexual conflict despite male monopolization
   attempts.},

Abstract = {Transposable elements provide a highly informative marker system for
   analyzing evolutionary histories. To solve controversially discussed
   topics in strepsirrhine phylogeny, we characterized 61 loci containing
   short interspersed elements (SINEs) and determined the SINE
   presence-absence pattern at orthologous loci in a representative
   strepsirrhine panel. This SINE monolocus study was complemented by a
   Southern blot analysis tracing multiple loci of two different
   strepsirrhine specific SINEs. The results thereof were combined with
   phylogenetic trees reconstructed on the basis of complete mitochondrial
   cytochrome b sequences from all recognized strepsirrhine genera. Here we
   present evidence for (i) a sister group relationship of Malagasy
   Chiromyiformes and Lemuriformes, (h) Lorisidae being a monophyletic
   sister clade to the Galagidae, and (M) common ancestry of African and
   Asian lorisids. Based on these findings, we conclude that strepsirrhines
   originated in Africa and that Madagascar and Asia were colonized by
   respective single immigration events. In agreement with paleocontinental
   data, the molecular analyses suggest a crossing of the Mozambique
   channel by rafting between the late Cretaceous and the middle Eocene,
   whereas Asia was most likely colonized between the early Eocene and the
   middle Oligocene on a continental route. Furthermore, one SINE
   integration links the two Lemuriformes families, Lemuridae and
   Indriidae, indicating a common origin of diurnality or cathemerality and
   a later reversal to nocturnality by the indriid genus Avahi.},

Abstract = {The age-related decline in olfaction is well documented in humans.
   However, no data are available to date oil changes in olfactory
   sensitivity with age in nonhuman primates. In the male gray mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus), a prosimian primate, the sense of smell is of high
   relevance for the modulation of both behavioral and physiological
   functions. We first assessed the effect of aging on physiological
   responses to urinary cues by measuring reproductive function in adult
   and aged males exposed to urine odor of preoestrous females. We then
   evaluated the effect of aging on chemosensory function using a
   discrimination test in freely behaving animals. Our results indicate
   that whereas adult animals show a clear increase in testosterone levels
   when exposed to female urine odor, this effect is lacking in aged
   animals. In addition, chemosensory function shows a progressive decline
   with age. Using both physiological responses to urinary volatiles and
   spontaneous behavior, this study provides the first data set on the
   effect of aging on chemosensory responsiveness in a nonhuman primate.

Abstract = {The climate of western Madagascar is characterized by a long ( 8 - 9 mo)
   dry season during which small rivers run dry, so that most animals are
   dependent on access to a few permanent water holes. We studied the
   effects of water scarcity at the end of the dry season on the ranging
   behavior of 4 groups of redfronted lemurs (Eulemur fulvus rufus) living
   at different distances from the Kirindy Riverbed in the Kirindy/CFPF
   forest northeast of Morondava. Using radio-collars, we located 2
   resident groups with permanent home ranges near the river, and 2
   non-resident groups and followed them for 60 days. We obtained a GPS
   reading every 30 min and later analyzed them with GIS ArcView to
   determine the size and location of each group's ( core) home range. One
   group resided in direct proximity to the riverbed with several water
   holes and made regular short trips ( mean 330 m) to drink. A second
   resident group had no direct access to water and made regular trips to
   the same water hole at a mean distance of 590 m from their home range.
   One non-resident group had a center of activity about 1300 m from the
   nearest water hole, to which they traveled on a non-daily basis. The
   other non-resident group established a temporary binuclear home range
   with one center of activity near the riverbed, about 2900 m away from
   the other center of activity. Thus, redfronted lemurs use different
   drinking and ranging tactics as a function of the distance of their core
   areas from the nearest water source.},

   Cond. Res. 18(1):35-47. 2004. - The purpose of this study was to examine
   the existing research on single-set vs. multiple-set resistance training
   programs. Using the meta-analytic approach, we included studies that met
   the following criteria in our analysis: (a) at least 6 subjects per
   group; (b) subject groups consisting of single-set vs. multiple-set
   resistance training programs; (c) pretest and posttest strength
   measures; (d) training programs of 6 weeks or more; (e) apparently
   ``healthy{''} individuals free from orthopedic limitations; and (f)
   published studies in English-language journals only. Sixteen studies
   generated 103 effect sizes (ESs) based on a total of 621 subjects,
   ranging in age from 15-71 years. Across all designs, intervention
   strategies, and categories, the pretest to posttest ES in muscular
   strength was ((chi) over bar = 1.4 +/- 1.4; 95\% confidence interval,
   0.41-3.8; p < 0.001). The results of 2 x 2 analysis of variance revealed
   simple main effects for age, training status (trained vs. untrained),
   and research design (p < 0.001). No significant main effects were found
   for sex, program duration, and set end point. Significant interactions
   were found for training status and program duration (6-16 weeks vs.
   17-40 weeks) and number of sets performed (single vs. multiple). The
   data indicated that trained individuals performing multiple sets
   generated significantly greater increases in strength (p < 0.001). For
   programs with an extended duration, multiple sets were superior to
   single sets (p < 0.05). This quantitative review indicates that
   single-set programs for an initial short training period in untrained
   individuals result in similar strength gains as multiple-set programs.
   However, as progression occurs and higher gains are desired,
   multiple-set programs are more effective.},

Abstract = {The origin of primates has had a long history of discussion and debate,
   with few ever considering the impact of the original body weight on
   subsequent primate adaptive radiations. Here, I attempt to reconstruct
   early primate evolution by considering the initial size of primates as
   well as the critical functional-adaptive events that had to occur prior
   to the early Eocene. Microcebus is often viewed as a living model, and
   thus 40-65 g might represent a practical ancestral weight for the origin
   of primates. I consider a smaller original body weight, likely 10-15 g
   in actual size, and I address the biological implications for
   shrew-sized primates by comparing the behavioral ecology of mouse
   lemurs, our smallest living primates, to another tiny-sized mammalian
   group, the shrews (Family Soricidae). Several behavioral and ecological
   characteristics are shared by shrews and mouse lemurs, and several
   mammalian trends are evident with decreased size. I suggest that a
   shrew-sized ancestral primate would have had high metabolic,
   reproductive, and predation rates, relatively low population densities,
   and a dispersed and solitary existence with a promiscuous mating system.
   Although small mammals like shrews provide insights concerning the
   ancestral size of primates, primate origins have always been tied to
   arboreality. I assess other potential arboreal models such as
   Ptilocercus and Caluromys. By combining all of this information, I try
   to sequence the events in a functional-adaptive series that had to occur
   before the early Eocene primate radiations. I suggest that all of these
   important adaptive events had to occur at a small body size below 50 g.},

Abstract = {Sperm competition will be the inevitable consequence of polyandrous
   mating behavior if two or more males inseminate a single female. It has
   been demonstrated for a wide variety of animals that males adapt to this
   situation behaviorally, physiologically and morphologically, e.g. by
   evolving relatively large testes size to produce more sperm. All
   pair-living primates investigated so far were found to have relatively
   small testes, suggesting a monandrous mating system. We investigated the
   relationship between extra-pair paternity (EPP) rate as a measure of
   sperm competition intensity and relative testes size in a pair-living
   primate, the fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer). Paternity exclusion
   analyses for seven offspring using six polymorphic DNA-microsatellite
   markers suggested a high EPP rate. Female nocturnal travel distances
   were longer during the mating season, suggesting that females take an
   active role in achieving extra-pair copulations (EPCs). Surprisingly,
   fork-marked lemur testes size was relatively small compared to 23 other
   lemuroid primates, a result that is in contrast to predictions of sperm
   competition theory. Neither possible behavioral and morphological
   adaptations to an alternative paternity guard (i.e. mate guarding), nor
   sampling biases, phylogenetic constraints, and population density
   effects explain the absence of large testes in a species with high EPP,
   a phenomenon also known from birds with moderate to low EPP rates. We
   conclude that more data are needed on the frequency of EPCs, the timing
   of in-pair and extra-pair copulations, as well as the role of female
   choice, to explain why males of some species apparently do not adapt to
   sperm competition.},

Title = {Olfactory bulbectomy modifies photic entrainment and circadian rhythms

Abstract = {Studies on rodents have emphasized that removal of the olfactory bulbs
   modulates circadian rhythmicity. Using telemetric recordings of both
   body temperature (T-b) and locomotor activity (LA) in a male nocturnal
   primate, the gray mouse lemur, the authors investigated the effects of
   olfactory bulbectomy on (1) the circadian periods of T-b and LA in
   constant dim light condition, and (2) photic re-entrainment rates of
   circadian rhythms following 6-h phase shifts of entrained light-dark
   cycle (LD 12:12). Under free-running condition, bulbectomized males had
   significantly shorter circadian periods of T-b and LA rhythms than those
   of control males. However, the profiles of T-b rhythms, characterized by
   a phase of hypothermia at the beginning of the subjective day, and T-b
   parameters were not modified by olfactory bulbectomy. Under a light-dark
   cycle, olfactory bulbectomy significantly modified the expression of
   daily hypothermia, especially by an increase in the latency to reach
   minimal daily T-b, suggesting a delayed response to induction of daily
   hypothermia by light onset. Reentrainment rates following both a 6-h
   phase advance and a 6-h phase delay of entrained LD were also delayed in
   bulbectomized males. Olfactory bulbectomy led to significant
   fragmentation of locomotor activity and increased locomotor activity
   levels during the resting period. The shortening of circadian periods in
   bulbectomized males could partly explain the delayed responses to photic
   stimuli since in control males, the longer the circadian period, the
   better the response to light entrainment. This experiment shows for the
   1st time that olfactory bulbs can markedly modify the circadian system
   in a primate.},

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {Many species fall into specific mating-system categories, and that
   category is usually associated with a suite of behavioral and
   morphological characteristics. Several lemur species, including
   Propithecus diadema edwardsi, have been labeled `idiosyncratic' because
   variation in socionomic sex ratios among groups is consistent with wide
   variation in social structure. We used several hypotheses founded in
   behavioral ecology to assess variability in P.d. edwardsi. First we
   examined 46 group-mating seasons to quantify variability. We then tested
   predictions that the number of males per group would increase as the
   number of adult females increased, and the number of males would
   increase as female mating synchrony increased. Examining variation in
   offspring survival relative to the number of adult males in a group may
   tell us which composition is likely to persist into the future, so we
   also hypothesized that as the number of males in a group increased,
   fertility and offspring survival would increase. We found an equal
   distribution of polygynous, polygynandrous, pairs, and polyandrous
   groups. Furthermore, female distribution and mating synchrony did not
   predict the number of males, and offspring survival was not correlated
   with the number of males. Since infants survived equally well in groups
   of all compositions, sifakas experienced no pressure to maintain a
   particular number of adult males per adult female. The small number of
   adults per group (mean=3.2) may result from balancing feeding
   competition against predator detection. Augmenting the mate pool
   available from the group with mates from neighboring groups may promote
   the notable variability seen in the adult group compositions of sifakas.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {The succession in time and space of specific germ cell associations,
   denoted as spermatogenic stages, is a typical feature of mammalian
   spermatogenesis. The arrangement of these stages is either single stage
   (one spermatogenic stage per tubular cross-section) or multistage (more
   than one spermatogenic stage per tubular cross-section). It has been
   proposed that the single-stage versus multistage arrangement is related
   to spermatogenic efficiency and that the multistage arrangement is
   typical for hominids. In the present work, the arrangement of
   spermatogenic stages and the spermatogenic efficiency of 17 primate
   species, comprising Strepsirrhini (Prosimians: Lemuriformes,
   Lorisiformes), Platyrrhini (New World primates), Catarrhini (Old World
   primates), and Hominoidea (great apes and humans), were analyzed
   comparatively by quantitative histological and flow cytometric means. We
   found a predominant single-stage tubular organization in the
   Strepsirrhini, indicating that the single-stage form represents the
   ancestral state. The highest degree of multistage complexity was found
   in Hominoidea (except orangutan) and in Platyrrhini, but not in
   Catarrhini. Hence, no direct relationship between
   single-stage/multistage tubular topography and phylogeny could be
   established across primates. In fact, the tubule arrangement seen in
   Platyrrhini and Catarrhini primates is the reverse of what might be
   expected from phylogeny. Interestingly, spermatogenic efficiency was
   similar in all species. We found no correlation between
   single-stage/multistage arrangement and spermatogenic efficiency or
   mating system. We speculate that the presence of a
   single-stage/multistage organization might simply reflect germ cell
   clonal size. Our findings further indicate that sperm competition in
   primates is not reflected at the level of testicular function.},

Abstract = {We characterize the spatial organization of red-tailed sportive lemurs
   (Lepilemur ruficaudatus) as a key aspect of their social organization
   and social system. Sportive lemurs are small (<1000 g), nocturnal and
   folivorous primates endemic to Madagascar. We studied a population of 57
   individually-marked individuals in Kirindy Forest, western Madagascar,
   between 1995 and 2001. We radio-tracked 20 males and 26 females of the
   marked population to obtain detailed information on the size and
   location of their home ranges. Census data and morphometric measurements
   provided complementary data sets. Males and females occupied small (<1
   ha) home-ranges. Long-term records from 9 individuals revealed
   home-range stability over several years. In 4 cases home ranges
   overlapped extensively with that of one member of the opposite sex; in 2
   cases, a spatial association of 1 male and 2 females occurred. However,
   home ranges overlapped very little with neighboring individuals of both
   sexes. During the study period, spatially associated individuals used on
   average 5.6 sleeping trees within 117 days, but they spent on average
   only about every fourth night together. The data suggest that home
   ranges in red-tailed sportive lemurs are exclusively used by pairs or
   trios and that the modal social organization of red-tailed sportive
   lemurs is pair-living.},

Abstract = {The Carnivora are one of only four orders of terrestrial mammals living
   in Madagascar today. All four (carnivorans, primates, rodents and
   lipotyphlan insectivores) are placental mammals with limited means for
   dispersal, yet they occur on a large island that has been surrounded by
   a formidable oceanic barrier for at least(88) million years(1,2),
   predating the age of origin for any of these groups(3,4). Even so, as
   many as four colonizations of Madagascar have been proposed for the
   Carnivora alone(5). The mystery of the island's mammalian origins is
   confounded by its poor Tertiary fossil record, which leaves us with no
   direct means for estimating dates of initial diversification. Here we
   use a multi-gene phylogenetic analysis to show that Malagasy carnivorans
   are monophyletic and thus the product of a single colonization of
   Madagascar by an African ancestor. Furthermore, a bayesian analysis(6)
   of divergence ages for Malagasy carnivorans and lemuriforms indicates
   that their respective colonizations were temporally separated by tens of
   millions of years. We therefore conclude that a single event, such as
   vicariance or common dispersal, cannot explain the presence of both
   groups in Madagascar.},

Title = {Artificially accelerated aging by shortened photoperiod alters early
   gene expression (Fos) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and
   sulfatoxymelatonin excretion in a small primate, Microcebus murinus},
Journal = {NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {105},

Pages = {403-412},
Abstract = {In mammals, a number of anatomical and functional changes occur in the
   circadian timing system with aging. In certain species, aging can be
   modified by various factors which induce a number of pathological
   changes. In a small primate, the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus),
   long-term acceleration of seasonal rhythms by exposing the animals to a
   shortened photoperiodic regime (up to 2.5 times the natural
   photoperiodic regime) alters longevity, based on survival curves and
   morphological changes. This provides a model for challenging the idea
   that modifications of the circadian pacemaker are related to
   chronological (years) versus biological (photoperiodic cycles) age.
   To assess the effect of aging and accelerated aging on the circadian
   pacemaker of this primate, we measured body weight variations, the daily
   rhythm in urine 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and the light-induced expression of
   the immediate early gene (Fos) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of mouse
   iemurs that had been exposed to different photoperiodic cycles. Urine
   samples were collected throughout the day and urine 6-sulfatoxymelatonin
   levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Light-induced Fos expression
   in the suprachiasmatic nucleus was studied by exposing the animals to a
   15-min monochromatic pulse of light (500 nm) at saturating or
   sub-saturating levels of irradiance (10(11) or 10(14) photons/cm(2)/s)
   during the dark phase. The classical pattern of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin
   excretion was significantly altered in aged mouse lemurs which failed to
   show a nocturnal peak. Fos expression following exposure to low levels
   of irradiance was reduced by 88\% in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of aged
   mouse lemurs, Exposure to higher irradiance levels showed similar
   results, with a reduction of 66\% in Fos expression in the aged animals,
   Animals subjected to artificially accelerated aging demonstrated the
   same alterations in melatonin production and Fos response to light as
   animals that had been maintained in a routine photoperiodic cycle.
   Our data indicate that there are dramatic changes in melatonin
   production and in the cellular response to photic input in the
   suprachiasmatic nucleus of aged mouse lemurs, and that these alterations
   depend on the number of expressed seasonal cycles rather than on a fixed
   chronological age. These results provide new insights into the
   mechanisms underlying artificial accelerated aging at the level of the
   molecular mechanisms of the biological clock. (C) 2001 IBRO. Published

Title = {Use of local North Carolina browse species to supplement the diet of a

Journal = {ZOO BIOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The nutrient content and intake of locally available North Carolina
   browse was evaluated for use as a supplement to a herbivorous primate
   diet of commercial biscuit and produce. Twice weekly from May to October
   1997, total dietary intakes were determined for two groups of folivorous
   lemurs. Group I consisted of Propithecus diadema diadema (n = 1) and R
   tattersalli (n = 1) and group II consisted of P. verreauxi coquereli (n
   = 3). Six pooled samples of the diet and weekly samples of three browse
   species, Rhus copallina, Albizia julibrissin, and Liquidamber
   styrachiflua were analyzed for dry matter, energy, fiber, and nitrogen
   content. Browse species were also analyzed for nonprotein nitrogen and
   acid-insoluble nitrogen. Group average dry matter intakes were 37.1 +/-
   2.2\% (mean +/- SEM) and 49.7 +/- 3.0\% of amount offered for groups I
   and H, respectively. Browse contributed 40.7 +/- 2.9\% and 29.6 +/-
   2.4\% of the total daily intake for groups I and H, respectively. Browse
   species differed (P < 0.05) for dry matter, energy, neutral detergent
   fiber, acid detergent fiber, cellulose, lignin, total nitrogen,
   nonprotein nitrogen, available nitrogen, and available protein. R.
   copallina and L. styrachiflua were similar in total nitrogen, available
   nitrogen, and nonprotein nitrogen; A. julibrissin was higher. L.
   styrachiflita was highest in lignin. Dry matter, acid detergent fiber,
   and lignin in browse samples increased seasonally (P < 0.05), whereas
   available protein decreased (P < 0.01). Animals were offered and
   consumed R. copallina most often, followed by A. julibrisson and L.
   styrachiflua. With the exception of R. copallina, animals generally
   consumed oily the immature leaves, flowers, or seeds of species offered.
   Daily dry matter intake varied because of both browse offered and
   consumed and biscuit and produce diet consumed. Thus, increased fiber
   density can be a major benefit of browse use only when incorporated into
   the total diet with respect to species use, quantity of other diet
   ingredients offered, and targeted nutrient intakes. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {Leaping primates are specialized for hindlimb-propelled locomotion
   within arboreal habitats. As a group, they include members of
   Galagonidae, Lemuriformes and Tarsiidae. Postcranial characters analysed
   here include humeral and femoral diaphyseal rigidity, articular surface
   areas and lengths. Data for leaper taxa are compared with corresponding
   data for less specialized small primates. The more generalized
   comparative primates include both closely related prosimians and
   distantly related platyrrhines (New World monkeys). In addition, the
   leapers are subdivided for further analysis according to body size and
   taxonomic association. Questions addressed concern the identification of
   functionally and/or phylogenetically linked traits in leaper postcrania.
   Results indicate that leapers as a group have relatively higher femoral
   diaphyseal rigidity and longer femora than do more generalized primates.
   These traits are also present in Pithecia pithecia, a platyrrhine leaper
   included for comparison. These enhanced properties probably function in
   resisting large hindlimb forces incurred during leaping, and in
   producing longer, more efficient leaps. Most of the large-bodied
   lemuriform leapers are further distinguished in having relatively bigger
   femoral heads and reduced humeral rigidity. The small-bodied leapers,
   galagonids and tarsiids, do not differ in either femoral head surface
   area or in any of the humeral properties from more generalized primates.
   Pithecia has a large femoral head like lemuriforms, but it is not
   reduced in humeral rigidity. Aspects of hip joint structure and mobility
   may be related to femoral head size in lemuriforms and Pithecia.
   Explanations regarding reduced lemuriform humeral rigidity are also
   explored. Differences between lemuriform primates are also present, most
   notably in aspects of the distal humerus. Indrids are characterized by
   relatively reduced trochleae, while many lemurids have relatively small
   capitula. These features are interpreted with regard to frequencies of
   suspensory behaviour and quadrupedalism.},

Abstract = {Under free-running conditions, the grey lesser mouse lemur expresses a
   circadian activity-rest rhythm with a period particularly short (22.50
   +/- 0.6 h) for a mammal. Light exerts a strong suppressive effect upon
   activity. After transfer from nycthemeral to free-running conditions the
   duration of activity was systematically increased. This extension took
   place in the first cycle and was characterized by both a phase advance
   in activity onset and an even larger phase delay in activity offset.
   This phenomenon was more pronounced after long day entrainment. Any
   shift of the light-dark cycle was followed the next day by a
   corresponding shift in activity onset. The phase response curve pattern
   was similar to that already described for nocturnal mammals. Due to the
   strength of light as a zeitgeber and the plasticity of the response to
   photic conditions, the mouse lemur appears as a convenient species for
   chronobiological studies on non-human primates. (C) 1999 Academie des

Title = {Takeoff and landing forces of leaping strepsirhine primates},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {279-292},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Knowledge of the forces animals generate and are exposed to during
   locomotion is an important prerequisite for understanding the
   musculoskeletal correlates of locomotor modes. We recorded takeoff and
   landing forces for 14 animals representing seven species of strepsirhine
   primates with a compliant force pole. Our sample included both
   specialized vertical clingers and leapers and more generalized species.
   Takeoff forces are higher than landing forces. Peak forces during
   acceleration for takeoff ranged from 6 to 12 times body weight, and the
   peak impact forces at landing are between 5 and 9 times body weight.
   There is a size-related trend in peak force magnitudes. Both takeoff and
   landing forces decrease with increasing body size in our sample of
   animals from 1 kg to over 5 kg. Peak forces increase with distance
   leapt. The distance effect is less clear, probably due to the narrow
   range of distances represented in our sample. A comparison of subadult
   and adult animals of two species of sifakas reveals a tendency for the
   young animals to exert relatively higher peak forces in comparison to
   their adult conspecifics. Finally, Lemur catta and Eulemur rubriventer,
   the ``generalists{''} in our sample, tend to generate higher forces for
   equal tasks than the specialized vertical clingers and leaper; (i.e.,
   the indriids and Hapalemur).
   A broad-scale comparison of peak leaping forces and peak forces for
   quadrupedal and bipedal walking and running shows that leaping at small
   body size is associated with exceptionally high forces. Whereas relative
   forces (i.e., forces divided by body weight) decrease with increasing
   body mass for leaping, forces for walking and running do not change much
   with size. Leaping forces in our sample scale to (mass)(-1/3), which is
   consistent with expectations derived from geometric similarity models.
   Forces associated with other locomotor activities do not appear to
   follow this pattern. The very high forces found in strepsirhine leapers
   do not seem to be matched by bone robusticity beyond that documented for
   quadrupedal species. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {97-114},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The issue of whether nails or claws were present on the digits of the
   last common ancestor of living primates is central to the understanding
   of the ecological context in which the order originated. Two lines of
   evidence are available, the shape (claw, nail, toilet-claw) and the
   histological structure (one or two horny strata). Here we review the
   existing data regarding the shape and histological structure of
   cheirideal appendages in primates and present new information from a
   wide range of living primates. We demonstrate the presence of a typical
   toilet-claw in Daubentonia madagascariensis and discuss its
   consequences, since the alleged lack of such structures in this species
   has long obscured the issue. The general view that primate nails, with
   the exception of those in New World primates, consist of only one layer
   is disproved by the presence of two distinct strata in the nails of the
   feet of three out of seven catarrhine species examined, as well as in
   Lemur catta. The combined new and old data indicate that the last common
   ancestor of the extant primates had lost the typical mammalian claws of
   its ancestors and developed nails on all pedal digits except digit II,
   which bore a toilet-claw. All nails as well as the toilet-claw
   originally consisted of two layers. We present a new hypothesis
   regarding the adaptational significance of these changes. (C) 1999

Abstract = {Infanticide might be described as a reproductive strategy employed by
   anthropoid primate males when they immigrate into new groups. But
   infanticide has rarely been observed in wild prosimian primates. For the
   Malagasy lemurs this may reflect one or more of the following: strict
   breeding seasons; relative monomorphism in canine tooth and body size;
   small group sizes; male-female dominance relations; and male-female
   dyads within groups. We addressed the following questions: Do prosimian
   males commit infanticide in circumstances similar to those in which
   anthropoids do? and Is there any reproductive advantage for a highly
   seasonal breeder to commit infanticide? To help answer these questions,
   we describe the death of a 24-hr-old infant male Propithecus diadema
   edwardsi from wounds received during a fight between his mother, her
   adult daughter, and a newly immigrant male. Interbirth intervals between
   surviving offspring are 2 years for Propithecus diadema edwardsi
   therefore, a male could dramatically shorten the time between
   reproductive windows by killing an infant. Whether this tactic would be
   favored by sexual selection cannot be addressed until more information
   has been collected on the length of interbirth interval due to
   infanticide relative to that of infant death by other causes; how social
   factors such as stability of breeding relationships affect long-term
   male reproductive success; how effective female counterstrategies are to
   prevent infanticide and/or whether they choose to mate with males that
   commit infanticide; and how often males that kill infants subsequently
   sire infants, particularly in groups that contain a resident male.},

Volume = {78},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The ultrastructure of the epididymal sperm of Tarsius bancanus is
   described. The sperm possess the typical eutherian pattern of a
   dorsoventrally flattened, ovate sperm head, comprising a nucleus capped
   by a symmetrical acrosome, and a distinct midpiece and principal piece
   containing a 9 + 9 + 2 arrangement of outer coarse fibres and
   microtubules. However, unique features are also present. The overall
   head length (9 mu m) equals the greatest for any primate yet examined,
   and the subacrosomal space (''perforatorium'' or
   `'pseudoperforatorium'') tilted at 30 degrees to the sagittal axis of
   the sperm, is described for the first time for mammals. The acrosome
   extends only a short distance beyond the length of the nucleus of the
   mature sperm, and a significant reduction in the acrosome to nuclei
   ratio appears to occur during the final stages of sperm maturation. In
   contrast to earlier predictions based on the spermatid of Tarsius
   syrhicta, the mature spermatozoa of Tarsius shows greatest morphological
   similarity with the sperm of the Anthropoidea, which have a short
   symmetrical acrosome, than with the Strepsirhini, which have a
   relatively long acrosome that can be either symmetrical (Lemuriformes)
   or asymetrical (Lorisiformes). Four proposed phylogenies of the Primates
   are assessed using comparative sperm ultrastructure. Placing the
   Tarsiidae as a sister group to the Lorisidae appears the least likely.
   The sperm data are consistent with the Tarsiidae being a sister group to
   the Anthropoidea, to the Strepsirhini, or even to the extant primate
   groups as a whole. Use of sperm morphology to provide characters in
   phylogenetic systematics of the primates is discussed, and the principle
   of `'total evidence'' is preferred to the common practice of `'hanging''
   sperm on phylogenetic hypotheses based on other evidence. (C) 1997 The

   predictions of sexual selection theory in that polygynous species lack
   sexual dimorphism, have even adult sex ratios and often live in
   female-dominated societies. It has been hypothesized that intrasexual
   selection in these species is either reduced or primarily focused on
   traits related to scramble competition. The goal of this study was to
   examine these hypotheses by studying the mating system of a solitary
   nocturnal species, Mirza coquereli. During a 4-year held study in
   western Madagascar, I captured and followed 88 individually marked
   animals. I found that adult males were significantly larger than
   females, providing the first evidence for sexual size dimorphism in
   lemurs. In addition, the adult sex ratio was biased in favour of females
   in 3 out of 4 years. There was no significant sex difference in canine
   size, however. Males showed pronounced seasonal variation in testis size
   with a 5-fold increase before and during the short annual mating season.
   During the mating season, males had more injuries than females and more
   than quadrupled their home ranges, overlapping with those of more than
   ten females, but also with about the same number of rivals. Only about
   one social interaction per 10 h of observation was recorded, but none of
   them were matings. Together, these results indicate that these solitary
   lemurs are clearly subject to intrasexual selection and that male-male
   competition is primarily, but not exclusively, of the scramble type. In
   addition, they suggest that the above-mentioned idiosyncracies may be
   limited to group-living lemurs, that social systems of solitary primates
   are more diverse than previously thought, and that the temporal
   distribution of receptive females is responsible for this particular
   male mating strategy.},

Abstract = {The foot, perhaps more than any other region of the primate body,
   reflects the interaction of positional behaviors with the geometric
   properties of available supports. The ability to reverse the hind foot
   during hindlimb suspension while hanging from a horizontal support or
   descending a large diameter vertical trunk has been noted in many
   arboreal mammals, including primates. Observations of Varecia variegata
   in the wild and under seminatural conditions document hindlimb
   suspension in this lemurid primate. The kinematics and skeletal
   correlates of this behavior are examined. Analogy is made with the form
   and function exhibited by nonprimate mammalian taxa employing this
   behavior. Examples of carnivores and rodents display very similar
   adaptations of the tarsals, while other mammals, such as the
   xenarthrans, accomplish a similar end by means of different
   morphologies. However, a suite of features is identified that is shared
   by mammals capable of hind foot reversal. Hindlimb suspension
   effectively increases the potential feeding space available to a
   foraging mammal and represents a significant, and often unrecognized,
   alternative adaptive strategy to forelimb suspension and prehensile-tail
   suspension in primates.},

Abstract = {The lesser mouse lemur, a small prosimian primate, exhibits seasonal
   rhythms strictly controlled by photoperiodic variations. Exposure to day
   lengths shorter than 12 h results in complete sexual rest, fattening,
   lethargy, and reduced behavioral activities; whereas exposure to day
   lengths greater than 12 h induces sexual activity, an increase in
   behavioral activities, and high hormonal levels. The objective of this
   study was to test whether long-term acceleration of seasonal rhythms may
   affect survival and longevity of this primate. In captivity,
   acceleration of seasonal rhythms was obtained by exposing the animals to
   an accelerated photoperiodic regimen consisting of 5 months of long
   photoperiod followed by 3 months of short photoperiod. The age-specific
   survival. rate in animals exposed from birth to accelerated
   photoperiodic conditions (n = 89) was compared to the age-specific
   survival rate of animals maintained under a natural photoperiod (n =
   68). Independent of sexes, the mean life span (45.5 +/- 2.1 months) and
   maximal survival (79.3 +/- 3.3 months) were significantly (p <.01)
   shortened in mouse lemurs exposed to the accelerated photoperiodic cycle
   compared to those in animals Living under annual photoperiod (63.2 +/-
   2.5 and 98 +/- 3.9 months for mean life span and maximal survival,
   respectively). This reduction of about 30\% of life span was not
   accompanied by a desynchronization of biological rhythms under
   photoperiodic control and was not related to an increase in reproduction
   or in duration of time spent in active conditions. However, when the
   number of seasonal cycles experienced by 1 individual is considered
   rather than chronological age, the mean life span was 5 seasonal cycles
   and maximum survival reached 9-10 cycles, independent of sex or of
   photoperiodic regimen. These results suggest that in mouse lemurs, as in
   other seasonal mammals, longevity may depend on the expression of a
   fixed number of seasonal cycles rather than on a fixed biological age.},

Abstract = {We studied phylogenetic relationships of 39 primate species using
   sequences of the epsilon-globin gene. For 13 species, we also included
   flanking sequences 5' of this locus. Parsimony analyses support the
   association of tarsiers with the anthropoids. Our analysis of New World
   monkeys supports the model in which the callitrichines form a clade with
   Aotus, Cebus, and Saimiri, with Cebus and Saimiri being sister taxa.
   However analysis of the 5' flanking sequences did not support grouping
   the atelines with Callicebus and the pitheciins. Our data support the
   classification of platyrrhines into three families, Cebidae (consisting
   of Cebus, Saimiri, Aotus, and the callitrichines; Atelidae-the atelines;
   and Pitheciidae-Callicebus and the pithiciins. The strepsirhines form
   well-defined lemuroid and lorisoid clades, with the cheirogaleids (dwarf
   and mouse lemurs) and Daubentonia (aye-aye) in the lemuroids, and the
   aye-aye being the most anciently derived. These results support the
   hypothesis that nonhuman primates of Madagascar descended from a single
   lineage. Local molecular clock calculations indicate that the divergence
   of lemuroid and lorisoid lineages and the earliest diversification of
   lemuroids, occurred during the Eocene. The divergence of major lorisoid
   lineages was probably considerably more recent, possibly near the
   Miocene-Oligocene boundary. Within hominoids some estimated dates differ
   somewhat from those found with more extensive noncoding sequences in the
   beta-globin cluster.},

Year = {1997},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-19},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {The main objective of this study was to investigate two predictions of
   sexual selection theory concerning interspecific variation in testis
   size among strepsirhine primates (Lemuriformes and Lorisiformes). First,
   the unique evolutionary history of lemurs provides an opportunity for an
   independent test of the predictions of sperm competition theory
   regarding the relationship between mating system and relative testis
   size. Second, I examined the evolutionary relationship between the
   morphological correlates of pre- and postcopulatory competition (i.e.,
   between sexual dimorphism and testis size) because polygamous lemurs, in
   contrast to other polygamous primates, lack sexual dimorphism. Based on
   measurements from 174 captive strepsirhines from 24 species, I found
   that multi-mate species had significantly larger testes than pair-living
   ones, but that they did not differ significantly from solitary species.
   This result deviates from theoretical expectations, but may be the
   result of yet-unknown heterogeneity in mechanisms of male-male
   competition in both multi-male and solitary species. There was no
   difference in relative testis size between nonmonogamous lemurs and
   lorises, indicating that presumably lower levels of precopulatory
   competition are not necessarily compensated by more intense sperm
   competition. Body size and phylogenetic effects were also found to
   considerably affect interspecific variability in testis size. Analyses
   of independent contrasts revealed that evolutionary changes in mating
   system, testis size, sexual size, and canine dimorphism were not, or
   only weakly: associated in this monophyletic group of primates.
   Additional comprehensive comparative studies of sexual dimorphism,
   testis size, mating system, and copulatory behavior in these and other
   taxa are indicated to illuminate general patterns and causes of
   covariation among these traits.},

Abstract = {We used fluorescence in situ hybridisation to delineate the homology
   between the human karyotype and those of two lemur species (Eulemur
   macaco macaco and E. fulvus mayottensis). Human and lemur
   chromosome-specific probes were established by bivariate
   fluorescence-activated Row sorting (FAGS) and subsequent degenerate
   oligonucleotide-primed CR (DOP-PCR). Reciprocal painting of human probes
   to lemur chromosomes and vice versa allowed a detailed analysis of the
   interchromosomal rearrangements that had occurred during the evolution
   of these species. The results indicate that the genomes of both species
   have undergone only a few translocations during more that 45 million
   years of lemur and human evolution. The synteny of homologs 10 human
   chromosomes 3, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21; X, and Y was found to be
   conserved in rile two lemur species. Taking nonprimate mammals as the
   outgroup for primates, ancestral conditions for various primate
   chromosomes were identified and distinguished from derived forms. Lemur
   chromosome painting probes were also used for cross-species
   hybridization between the two lemur species. The results support an
   earlier assumption, made on-the basis of chromosome banding, that the
   karyotypes of the two species have evolved exclusively by Robertsonian
   transformations. All probes derived from E. f. mayottensis chromosomes
   specific for homologs involved in rearrangements in E. In, macaco
   exclusively painted entire chromosome arms, The results further indicate
   that E. f. mayottensis most probably has a more ancestral karyotype than
   E. m. macaco. Probes derived from prosimians will be useful in comparing
   the karyotypes of other lower primates, which will improve our
   understanding of early primate genome evolution.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {195-211},
Abstract = {Hypothesized relationships between milk composition and life history
   traits were examined by analyzing mid-lactation milks of seven lemurs
   (Eulemur fulvus, E. macaco, E. rubriventer E. mongoz, Varecia variegata,
   Hapalemur griseus, Lemur catta), three bushbabies (Otolemur
   crassicaudatus, O. garnettii, Galago moholi), and two lorises
   (Nycticebus coucang, Loris tardigradus); partial data were also obtained
   far the lemuroid Cheirogaleus medius. There were no significant
   differences in milk composition among species within either Eulemur or
   Otolemur, but the four genera for which multiple samples were available
   (Eulemur, Varecia, Otolemur, and Nycticebus) exhibited large composition
   differences. Eulemur milk was, on average, very dilute (9.9\% dry
   matter) and low in energy (0.49 kcal/g). These milks contained 0.9\%
   fat, 1.2\% protein, and 8.4\% carbohydrate on a fresh weight basis.
   Protein energy comprised only about 15\% of total milk energy. Varecia
   had significantly higher dry matter (13.5\%), fat (3.2\%), protein
   (4.2\%), gross energy (0.80 kcal/g), and protein energy:total energy
   ratio (28\%) than Eulemur. Milks of the lorisoid genera Otolemur and
   Nycticebus were very similar, and both had significantly higher dry
   matter(18.3, 16.3\%), fat (7.6, 7.0\%), and gross energy concentration
   (1.27, 1.13 kcal/g) than either lemuroid genus. Otolemur milk was higher
   in protein than Nycticebus milk. We conclude that lorises, bushbabies,
   and perhaps cheirogaleids produce relatively rich, energy-dense milks in
   comparison with anthropoid primates. However, dilute milks appear to be
   uniformly found among species of Eulemur and perhaps in Lemur catta. The
   milk of Varecia (and perhaps Hapalemur) is intermediate in composition.
   Differences in milk composition among prosimians may be related to
   differences in maternal care: prosimians that carry their young during
   lactation produce more dilute milks than do species which leave their
   young unattended for prolonged periods. When looking at primates as a
   whole, however, the picture is somewhat less clear, since the milks of
   some `'parkers'' like Varecia do closely resemble those of large
   anthropoid primates who carry their young. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {DNA sequences of the complete cytochrome b gene are shown to contain
   robust phylogenetic signal for the strepsirrhine primates (i.e., lemurs
   and lorises). The phylogeny derived from these data conforms to other
   molecular studies of strepsirrhine relationships despite the fact that
   uncorrected nucleotide distances are high for nearly all
   intrastrepsirrhine comparisons, with most in the 15\%-20\% range.
   Cytochrome b sequences support the hypothesis that Malagasy lemuriforms
   and Afro-Asian lorisiforms each comprise clades that share a
   sister-group relationship. A study (Adkins and Honeycutt 1994) of the
   cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII) gene placed one Malagasy primate
   (Daubentonia) at the base of the strepsirrhine clade, thereby suggesting
   a diphyletic Lemuriformes. The reanalysis of COII third-position
   transversions, either alone or in combination with cytochrome b
   third-position transversions, however, yields a tree that is congruent

Abstract = {We report new evidence that bears decisively on a long-standing
   controversy in primate systematics. DNA sequence data for the complete
   cytochrome b gene, combined with an expanded morphological data set,
   confirm the results of a previous study and again indicate that all
   extant Malagasy lemurs originated from a single common ancestor. These
   results, as well as those from other genetic studies, call for a
   revision of primate classifications in which the dwarf and mouse lemurs
   are placed within the Afro-Asian lorisiforms. The phylogenetic results,
   in agreement with paleocontinental data, indicate an African origin for
   the common ancestor of lemurs and lorises (the Strepsirrhini). The
   molecular data further suggest the surprising conclusion that lemurs
   began evolving independently by the early Eocene at the latest. This
   indicates that the Malagasy primate lineage is more ancient than
   generally thought and places the split between the two strepsirrhine
   lineages well before the appearance of known Eocene fossil primates. We
   conclude that primate origins were marked by rapid speciation and
   diversification sometime before the late Paleocene.},

Abstract = {Female sifaka mate selectively with one or more resident and/or
   non-resident males during the breeding season. Various adaptive
   explanations have been advanced to explain why female primates mate with
   multiple males including that 1) females seek to confuse paternity and
   thereby forestall male infanticide and/or ensure male infant care or 2)
   females seek to ensure fertilization. Assessing the power of
   fertilization insurance to explain mating patterns in females requires
   information on the temporal relationship between mating and ovarian
   hormones. The hormonal correlates of reproduction and mating in
   free-ranging Propithecus verreauxi were investigated using excreted
   steroids as indices of reproductive state. Solid-phase extraction and
   radioimmunoassay techniques were used to measure unconjugated estradiol
   (E(2)) and progesterone (P-4) in 485 desiccated fecal samples collected
   from five female sifaka before and during the breeding season at Beta
   Mahafaly, Madagascar. Results suggest that behavioral estrus was
   characterized by 10- to 15-day elevations in E(2); hormonal activity was
   observed to be similar to pseudo-estrus reported for other lemur
   species; apparent conception was associated with sustained P-4
   elevations beginning 1 to 3 days post-estrus with gestational phase
   elevations of E(2) beginning 42 to 45 days post-conception; and mating
   with multiple partners appeared not to be a prerequisite to
   fertilization, as conception resulted from both monoandrous and
   polyandrous matings. These preliminary data suggest that fertilization
   insurance is not adequate to explain polyandrous mating in sifaka at
   Beta Mahafaly. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Volume = {38},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The lesser mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) is a prosimian primate which
   presents evidence of sex ratio bias of offspring that agrees with the
   direction of bias predicted by the local resource competition model for
   facultative sex ratio adjustment. That is, females overproduced sons
   when grouped prior to mating, whereas isolated females exhibited the
   opposite tendency. In this solitary species, social communication relies
   heavily on urinary chemical signals. To test the hypothesis that sex
   biases induced by social factors may be linked to urinary cues, isolated
   females were exposed (n = 76) or not (control group, n = 16) to urinary
   cues from other reproductively active females from the beginning of the
   breeding season (induced by long photoperiod) until oestrus. During that
   period, females were either continuously (n = 17) or partially (n = 59)
   exposed to chemosignal stimulation. Females in oestrus were placed in
   contact with a breeding male and subsequently isolated until they gave
   birth. All females entered oestrus but the timing of oestrus was
   significantly delayed by 1 week in urine-exposed females. A general
   depressive effect of long-term urine exposure on fecundity was
   demonstrated, involving fewer impregnations, higher abortion frequency
   and smaller litter sizes. Among females giving birth (n = 55) to a total
   of 129 young, a significant positive correlation was found between sex
   ratio bias towards males and the duration of urine exposure. However,
   the shift in sex ratio at birth depended on the duration of urine
   stimulation during a sensitive period extending from the beginning of
   the long photoperiod until the beginning of the follicular phase. In the
   absence of urinary cues during the sensitive period, females
   significantly overproduced daughters (32\% males of 53 newborn). As
   urine exposure increased during the sensitive phase, the proportion of
   males in litters increased from 54\% males (n = 50) in partially
   urine-exposed females to a significant bias towards males (69.2\% of 26
   newborn) in totally exposed females. The biased sex ratio in response to
   chemical cues did not show consistent relationships with maternal body
   weight, parity or litter size. Although the intrinsic mechanisms
   involved in sex-biased conceptions are not known, chemical cues could
   interact with the photoperiodic control of gonadotropin secretions.},

Abstract = {Our comparative study of morphological (our data on selected living
   primates) and molecular characters (from the literature) confirms that,
   overall, phylogenetic reconstructions of Primates, and consequently
   their classifications, are more similar than dissimilar. When data from
   fossil Primates are incorporated, there may be several possible
   relationships among living Primates; the difference between most of them
   hinges mainly on the position of Tarsius. In one hypothesis, tarsiers
   are closely related to lemurs and lorises, and thus Primates is divided
   into Prosimii {[}lorises, lemurs, and tarsiers] and Anthropoidea
   {[}Platyrrhini and Catarrhini, i.e., monkeys, apes, and humans]. Two
   additional alternatives are that Tarsius is a sister group to the clade
   embracing lorises + lemurs and Anthropoidea and that in which all three
   lineages (Tarsius, lorises + lemurs, and Anthropoidea) form a
   polychotomy. In another hypothesis, tarsiers are closely related to
   anthropoids, giving these two branches: Strepsirhini {[}lemurs, lorises]
   and Haplorhini {[}tarsiers and Anthropoidea (Platyrrhini, the New World
   monkeys, and Catarrhini, Old World monkeys and Hominoidea)]. The first
   three alternatives gain some support from the fossil record, and the
   fourth from morphology of the living Tarsius and molecular data. It is
   emphasized that the morphological characters employed in this study for
   Tarsius are based on the only surviving genus of once-diverse tarsiiform
   primates known from the Eocene, and, although considered a `'living
   fossil,'' it cannot represent all of them. Furthermore, Tarsius embodies
   derived features of its own which may affect its systematic position,
   but not necessarily the position of Tarsiiformes. Although the early
   Tertiary adapoids might have more nearly resembled anthropoids in their
   biochemistry and placental developments, this hypothesis is not testable
   from fossils, and any inferred relationships here must be based on
   characters of skeletal anatomy. Alternatively, anthropoids may be
   derived from certain omomyids or from some as yet undiscovered Eocene
   African taxon. Close relationships among Homo, Pan, and Gorilla have
   been confirmed during recent decades; Pongo is the sister group to this
   trichotomy. With increasing molecular data, Homo and Pan appear to be
   closer to each other than to any other living hominid taxon. Gorilla is
   a sister group to the Homo-Pan clade and Ponga is a sister group to all
   of them. Morphologists have given limited evidence for such a
   dichotomous grouping. In this study, we support the Homo-Pan clade,
   although with characters not as strong as for Other clades. (C) 1996

Title = {Intrasexual selection and phylogenetic constraints in the evolution of

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {The goals of this study were to analyze the origin and function of sex
   differences in the size of canine teeth among Malagasy lemurs and other
   strepsirhine primates. These analyses allowed me to illuminate
   interactions between different mechanisms of sexual selection and to
   elucidate constraints on this sexually-selected trait. In contrast to
   central predictions of sexual selection theory, polygynous lemurs lack
   both sexual dimorphism in body size and male social dominance, but the
   degree of sexual dimorphism in the size of their canines is not known. A
   comparison of male and female canine size in 31 species of lemurs and
   lorises revealed significant male-biased canine dimorphism in only 6 of
   13 polygynous lemur species. This result is in contrast to predictions
   of a hypothesis that would explain the lack of size dimorphism in lemurs
   as a result of high viability costs because canine teeth presumably have
   low maintenance costs and because they are used as weapons in male-male
   combat. Moreover, because females had significantly larger maxillary
   canines than males in only one lemur species, female dominance is not
   generally based on female physical superiority and selective forces
   favoring female dominance do not constrain sexual canine dimorphism in
   the sense of a pleiotropic effect. Contrary to predictions of sexual
   selection theory, species differences in canine dimorphism across
   strepsirhines were neither associated with differences in mating system,
   nor with the potential frequency of aggression. Variation in canine
   dimorphism was also unrelated to differences in body size, but there
   were significant differences among families, pointing to strong
   phylogenetic constraints. This study demonstrated that polygynous lemurs
   are at most subject to weak intrasexual selection on dental traits used
   in male combat and that traits thought to be under intense sexual
   selection are strongly influenced by phylogenetic factors.},

Abstract = {Indrids are primarily vertical clingers and leapers but also engage to
   various extents in climbing, suspensory postures, bimanual movement,
   bipedal hopping, and quadrupedalism. It has been demonstrated that these
   behaviors are well reflected in the appendicular anatomy of these
   primates, while indrid vertebral anatomy has received relatively little
   attention. In this morphometric study, biomechanically relevant aspects
   of the lumbar vertebrae of Indri indri, Propithecus diadema, and
   Propithecus verreauxi were compared to those of Varecia variegata, a
   large-bodied predominantly pronograde and quadrupedal lemur. Results
   indicate that, compared to Varecia, the indrids have relatively shorter
   lumbar vertebral bodies, shorter lumbar regions, more dorsally
   projecting lumbar spinous processes, and more dorsally positioned lumbar
   transverse process tips. In addition, indrid lumbar spinous and
   transverse processes are oriented differently than those of Varecia.
   Overall, indrid lumbar vertebral morphology converges with that of
   hominoids, atelines, and possibly lorids,(1) suggesting a lumbar
   adaptation to upright or `'antipronograde'' postures that require a
   reduction in spinal flexibility. The dorsally projecting spinous
   processes may be related to back muscle extensor power during leaping
   and/or the maintenance of upright postures. By contrast, the lumbar
   vertebrae of Varecia resemble those of primates and other mammals that
   have habitually pronograde postures and emphasize spinal flexibility in
   the sagittal plane during locomotion. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},

Pages = {143-175},
Abstract = {Organisms are integrated systems whose physical and behavioral
   components codevelop and coevolve. Ontogenetic requirements in one
   domain are satisfied in part by prior or concurrent developments in
   another. This work explores how characteristic growth patterns in two
   primate groups interact with ecological, social, and other life-history
   constraints to promote the development of particular systems of
   agonistic relationship. First, the markedly size-dimorphic savanna
   baboons are contrasted with relatively nondimorphic macaques, where the
   pubertal growth capacity of males, relative to that of females, is
   comparatively modest. In baboons and other dimorphic Papionines,
   maturing males can be expected to invest more heavily in successful
   feeding competition, and known variation in the ontogeny of male-female
   dominance relations is well explained by this prediction. Data from five
   of the best-known species, for example, suggest that the female
   inclination to promote offspring dominance over male peers before
   puberty diminishes with increases in relative male size and growth
   potential at puberty. Potential mechanisms for the development of this
   pattern are discussed. Next, ontogenies are considered for ringtailed
   lemurs, a highly social, monomorphic prosimian primate in which seasonal
   scheduling of growth causes a large proportion of adult size to be
   achieved before weaning. In this species, daughters invariably develop
   strong alliances with their mothers, and pubertal females must overturn
   adults in dominance to remain in large natal groups. Despite
   life-history parallels between ringtails and the focal Papionines, the
   lemurs do not collaborate agonistically in ways that ensure matrilineal
   `'inheritance'' of dominance status, as seen in the monkeys. Body weight
   and individual fighting ability appear to determine dominance relations
   among infants, and asymmetries established before weaning typically
   remain stable until sexual maturation. Anatomical and behavioral data
   suggest that low visual acuity prevents ringtailed lemurs from
   developing a system of agonistic intervention that could stabilize adult
   dominance hierarchies and mediate rank inheritance. In any case, failure
   to promote the dominance of close kin is argued to have influenced
   life-history evolution in ringtailed lemurs extensively, including
   aspects of growth, reproductive biology, and social structure. These
   analyses identify foci for future research and illustrate the importance
   of bidirectional effects and feedback in the development and evolution

Title = {RELATIVE POSITION OF THE CHEIROGALEIDAE IN STREPSIRHINE PHYLOGENY - A

Abstract = {An examination of previous morphological and molecular studies of
   strepsirhine systematics suggests a conflict between the two types of
   data. Cladistic analyses of morphological data have indicated that the
   Malagasy primate family Cheirogaleidae is the sister taxon of the
   Afro-Asian lorisiforms and that together, cheirogaleids and lorisiforms
   comprise a monophyletic clade that excludes the Malagasy lemuriforms.
   Molecular studies, on the other hand, have consistently found that
   cheirogaleids and lemuriforms together are monophyletic to the exclusion
   of lorisiforms. Both types of studies, however, have suffered from
   methodological weaknesses: the morphological studies looked at too few
   characters and the molecular studies looked at too few taxa.
   This study examines a large and diverse morphological data set as well
   as molecular data from a comprehensive sample of strepsirhine taxa. The
   data sets are considered independently and jointly. When they are
   analyzed independently, the morphological data give weak support, and
   the molecular data strong support, to the hypothesis of Malagasy primate
   monophyly. When the two data sets are combined in a single analysis, the
   results are decisive. The `'total evidence'' approach yields compelling
   support to the hypothesis that cheirogaleids and remaining Malagasy
   lemuriforms comprise a monophyletic assemblage that excludes
   lorisiforms. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Volume = {35},

Abstract = {At least four hypotheses regarding the phylogenetic relationships within
   the Galaginae have been proposed, based on features of karyology,
   morphology, and behaviour, but these hypotheses share few common
   elements. Here we investigate erythrocytic allozymes as potential
   phylogenetic markers, and subject our results to a cladistic analysis.
   Our study offers little support for the previous models, but suggests
   instead that the greater galagos and G. alleni form a clade since they
   share character states for eight of the ten systems examined. The two
   lesser galago species could not be distinguished using these enzymes,
   and character states common to them and the
   allenicrassicaudatus-garnettii clade were found in only four systems.
   Our resultant cladogram accords well with the rather scant galagine
   fossil record. The data also show strong concordance with results
   obtained using highly repeated DNA sequences, which indicate that the
   galagos form a close-knit genetic group, while the Malagasy lemurids
   show considerably more inter-taxic variation.},

Abstract = {The amounts of nuclear DNA and the AT and GC content of four Eulemur
   (Prosimii, Lemuridae) species and of an E. coronatus x E. macaco hybrid
   were measured by flow cytometry in peripheral blood leukocytes,
   following propidium iodide, Hoechst 33258, and mithramycin staining.
   Hoechst 33258 and mithramycin were also used to evaluate the base
   composition of genomic DNA in the chromosomes. The amount of DNA
   resisting C-banding pretreatment (C-heterochromatic DNA) was measured in
   metaphase chromosomes by static fluorometry. The genome of E. coronatus
   was significantly larger than the genomes of all other species examined,
   due to a higher content of pericentromeric, mainly GC-rich,
   heterochromatic DNA. The restriction banding patterns produced by BamHI
   digestion and ethidium bromide staining on extracted DNA were studied in
   the hybrid and its parental species (E. coronatus and E. macaco). The
   restriction banding pattern of the sole E. coronatus individual showed
   two bands which were repeated in the restriction banding pattern of the
   hybrid. The qualitative and quantitative differences of
   C-heterochromatic DNA in E. coronatus confirm the `'splitting''
   processes and the phylogenetic relationships in the genus Eulemur
   suggested by Jung et al. (1992) on the basis of the restriction banding
   patterns produced by endonuclease digestion.},

Abstract = {Primates acquire gut microbiota from conspecifics through direct social
   contact and shared environmental exposures. Host behaviour is a
   prominent force in structuring gut microbial communities, yet the extent
   to which group or individual-level forces shape the long-term dynamics
   of gut microbiota is poorly understood. We investigated the effects of
   three aspects of host sociality (social groupings, dyadic interactions,
   and individual dispersal between groups) on gut microbiome composition
   and plasticity in 58 wild Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) from
   six social groups. Over the course of three dry seasons in a 5-year
   period, the six social groups maintained distinct gut microbial
   signatures, with the taxonomic composition of individual communities
   changing in tandem among coresiding group members. Samples collected
   from group members during each season were more similar than samples
   collected from single individuals across different years. In addition,
   new immigrants and individuals with less stable social ties exhibited
   elevated rates of microbiome turnover across seasons. Our results
   suggest that permanent social groupings shape the changing composition
   of commensal and mutualistic gut microbial communities and thus may be
   important drivers of health and resilience in wild primate populations.},

Abstract = {The Makira Natural Park (Makira) is the largest terrestrial protected
   area in Madagascar, supporting nearly 200,000 people living around the
   park, who derive a significant proportion of their animal-source foods
   from hunting. Makira is currently managed with three different policies:
   (1) traditional management with no external assistance; (2)
   community-based forest management (Gestion Contractualisee des Forets;
   GCF) with non-governmental support and externally developed policies;
   and (3) strict external management policies (Zone d'Occupation
   Controlee; ZOC), meaning a zone of controlled residence for communities
   inside the core protected area. Here, we longitudinally assess the
   impacts of these policies on wildlife hunting and consumption by using a
   difference-in-differences method to evaluate policy efficacy. We found
   that externally developed conservation policies led to drastically
   reduced wildlife hunting and consumption in Makira. We also found that
   public education in the form of environmental awareness-raising,
   conducted 1 year before adoption, led to a greater concealment of
   hunting behaviours. Overall, wildlife hunting and consumption have
   decreased in the Makira region since the adoption of GCF and ZOC
   policies and could be effective at reducing the unsustainable wildlife
   hunting across the Makira, particularly when supported by economic
   development and the creation of alternative sources of livelihood and
   food.},

Abstract = {Wild aye-ayes ( Daubentonia madagascariensis ) are notoriously difficult
   to study due to their solitary and nocturnal nature. While research is
   starting to elucidate the behaviors of wild adult aye-aye, an
   understanding of behaviors in young aye-ayes is still lacking. We
   studied the behavioral development of two male aye-aye subadults in
   Kianjavato, Madagascar from June 2015 to October 2017 and October 2017
   to December 2019, and two male offspring in Torotorofotsy, Madagascar,
   from August 2016 to December 2017 and September 2018 to May 2020. We
   then compared this information to previous studies on captive infant
   development. Wild infant aye-ayes first emerged from the nest between
   two and three months old. Traveling between trees occurred between four
   and four and a half months old. First attempts at foraging for
   invertebrates in a woody substrate occurred between five and eight
   months. Though nursing was rarely observed, the event was witnessed as
   late as 17 months for one aye-aye. The earliest solo nesting occurred at
   18 and a half months of age, and the latest at 23 months old. As with
   other primates, wild aye-ayes develop more slowly than their captive
   counterparts. We conclude that their protracted life history is likely
   associated with their percussive foraging behaviors and importance of
   invertebrates in their diet.},

Abstract = {In animal vocal communication, the development of adult-like
   vocalization is fundamental to interact appropriately with conspecifics.
   However, the factors that guide ontogenetic changes in the acoustic
   features remain poorly understood. In contrast with a historical view of
   nonhuman primate vocal production as substantially innate, recent
   research suggests that inheritance and physiological modification can
   only explain some of the developmental changes in call structure during
   growth. A particular case of acoustic communication is the indris'
   singing behavior, a peculiar case among Strepsirrhine primates. Thanks
   to a decade of intense data collection, this work provides the first
   long-term quantitative analysis on song development in a singing
   primate. To understand the ontogeny of such a complex vocal output, we
   investigated juvenile and sub-adult indris' vocal behavior, and we found
   that young individuals started participating in the chorus years earlier
   than previously reported. Our results indicated that spectro-temporal
   song parameters underwent essential changes during growth. In
   particular, the age and sex of the emitter influenced the indris' vocal
   activity. We found that frequency parameters showed consistent changes
   across the sexes, but the temporal features showed different
   developmental trajectories for males and females. Given the low level of
   morphological sexual dimorphism and the marked differences in vocal
   behavior, we hypothesize that factors like social influences and
   auditory feedback may affect songs' features, resulting in high vocal
   flexibility in juvenile indris. This trait may be pivotal in a species
   that engages in choruses with rapid vocal turn-taking.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Convergent evolution is a major topic in evolutionary biology. Low bone
   cortical compactness (CC, a measure of porosity of cortical bone) in the
   extant genera of ``tree sloths,{''} has been linked to their convergent
   slow arboreal ecology. This proposed relationship of low CC with a slow
   arboreal lifestyle suggests potential convergent evolution of this trait
   in other slow arboreal mammals. Femoral and humeral CC were analyzed in
   ``tree sloths,{''} lorisids, koala, and extinct palaeopropithecids and
   Megaladapis, in comparison to closely related but ecologically distinct
   taxa, in a phylogenetic framework. Low CC in ``tree sloths{''} is
   unparalleled by any analyzed clade and the high CC in extinct sloths
   suggests the recent convergence of low CC in ``tree sloths.{''} A
   tendency for low CC was found in Palaeopropithecus and Megaladapis.
   However, lorisids and the koala yielded unexpected CC patterns,
   preventing the recognition of a straightforward convergence of low CC in
   slow arboreal mammals. This study uncovers a complex relationship
   between CC and convergent evolution of slow arboreality, highlighting
   the multifactorial specificity of bone microstructure.},

Abstract = {Living primates show a complex trend in reduction of nasal cavity spaces
   and structures due to moderate to severe constraint on interorbital
   breadth. Here we describe the ontogeny of the posterior end of the
   primate cartilaginous nasal capsule, the thimble shaped posterior nasal
   cupula (PNC), which surrounds the hind end of the olfactory region. We
   used a histologically sectioned sample of strepsirrhine primates and two
   non-primates (Tupaia belangeri, Rousettus leschenaulti), and
   histochemical and immunohistochemical methods to study the PNC in a
   perinatal sample. At birth, most strepsirrhines possess only fragments
   of PNC, and these lack a perichondrium. Fetal specimens of several
   species reveal a more complete PNC, but the cartilage exhibits uneven or
   weak reactivity to type II collagen antibodies. Moreover, there is
   relatively less matrix than in the septal cartilage, resulting in
   clustering of chondrocytes, some of which are in direct contact with
   adjacent connective tissues. In one primate (Varecia spp.) and both
   non-primates, the PNC has a perichondrium at birth. In older, infant
   Varecia and Rousettus, the perichondrium of the PNC is absent, and PNC
   fragmentation at its posterior pole has occurred in the former. Loss of
   the perichondrium for the PNC appears to precede resorption of the
   posterior end of the nasal capsule. These results suggest that the
   consolidation of the basicranial and facial skeletons happens
   ontogenetically earlier in primates than other mammals. We hypothesize
   that early loss of cartilage at the sphenoethmoidal articulation limits
   chondral mechanisms for nasal complexity, such as interstitial expansion
   or endochondral ossification.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Socioecological theory predicts that larger groups are able to gain
   better access to resources because of their numerical advantage in
   intergroup contests. Nevertheless, the numerical superiority hypothesis
   has received mixed support, perhaps due to the collective action problem
   and sex differences in strategies and payoffs. We tested the numerical
   superiority and the collective action problem hypotheses using 141
   intergroup encounters in a 7-year dataset on 5 groups of Verreaux's
   sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) at Ankoatsifaka Research Station in
   Kirindy Mitea National Park in western Madagascar. Contrary to the
   numerical superiority hypothesis, larger groups were not more likely to
   supplant smaller groups, nor was success determined by participation of
   a larger number of one sex. Consistent with a collective action problem,
   group size negatively affected participation. Notably, the sexes
   differed in which factors predicted individual participation. Male
   participation, which may serve to defend mating opportunities with
   resident females and signal competitive ability to neighboring groups,
   was greater than female participation, though we did not detect any
   strong predictor of male participation. Female participation was more
   likely during the lactation season, when food resources were scarce,
   than during the mating season. Contrary to previous studies, which
   argued that mothers with infants avoid intergroup conflicts because of
   the risk of infanticide, our study suggests that maternal energetic
   stress due to lactation and food scarcity increases the benefits of
   defending resources and instead drives mothers to participate in
   intergroup encounters. Thus, individual reproductive payoffs provide the
   private incentives needed to induce collective action.},

Abstract = {Watermelon has a fleshy fruit and that is the reason sugars and organic
   acids play a key role in taste formulation. So far, there is no
   comprehensive study in watermelon regarding accumulation and regulation
   of sugars and organic acids. To understand the behaviour of sugars and
   organic acids two watermelon inbred lines ``203Z{''} (high sugar, low
   acid) and ``SW{''} (low sugar, high acid) were used. The contents of
   each sugars and organic acids at three different developmental stages
   were measured via ion chromatography. Total 38 genes which were involved
   in sugars and organic acids metabolism and transport were screened out
   in watermelon fruit flesh. Genes for sugars and organic acids regulation
   and transport were highly expressed during watermelon fruit ripening.
   Fructose was observed as the main sugar and malic acid was the main
   organic acid in watermelon fruit flesh. WMFBPA-2 that is involved in
   fructose breakdown was positively and significantly correlated with
   fructose. Aluminum activated malate transporters and malate
   dehydrogenase genes were involved in malate regulation and degradation.
   It was concluded that WMALMT-3 may participate in the regulation of
   malic acid and its accumulation in vacuole during watermelon fruit
   development. WMCS was found to be associated with citric acid
   regulation. This study will improve our understanding and lay foundation
   to explore the function of these genes and improvement of watermelon
   fruit quality.},

Abstract = {In the absence of evidence suggesting former ice or land bridges, the
   colonization of remote landmasses by non-aquatic, non-flying vertebrates
   is thought to result from long-distance over-water rafting (LDOR).
   However, Mazza et al. (2019) challenge the notion that mammals can make
   such journeys citing their perceived physiological inadequacies. They
   claim that lengthy transits combined with lack of food and water plus
   the stresses imposed by temperature, humidity and salinity render such
   passages impossible. We, though, contend that this reasoning is wrong.
   The few cases where LDOR has been invoked for mammal colonization have
   all involved small-bodied animals, several of which are able to
   drastically reduce their metabolic rates through torpor/hibernation when
   food and water are scarce. Furthermore, there may be sustenance.

Title = {Female Power in Verreaux's Sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) Is Based on
   Maturity, Not Body Size},

Abstract = {Conflicts between individuals are common among animals, with power
   dynamics often biased toward a particular sex. However, individuals
   across species exert power differently depending on the primary source
   of that power. Dominance-based power depends on fighting ability (e.g.,
   greater body size) whereas leverage-based power depends on resources
   that cannot be taken by force (e.g., mating opportunities). Both can
   change in relative importance during development. We examined the
   development and base of female-biased power structures in Verreaux's
   sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) by analyzing the effects of reproductive
   maturity and body mass on intersexual conflict outcomes. We used data on
   four social groups at Ankoatsifaka Research Station in Kirindy Mitea
   National Park collected from 2007 to 2016, which included 483 decided
   agonistic encounters with both behavioral and morphometric data
   available. We used generalized linear mixed models to examine the
   effects of age, body mass, and female reproductive maturity on conflict
   outcome. Power relationships between mature females and males were
   unambiguously female biased. Female reproductive maturity, and not body
   mass, predicted intersexual conflict outcomes. Once reproductively
   mature, females almost never lost to males, except when females had not
   yet had an infant survive past weaning. Our results are thus consistent
   with the hypothesis that female leverage characterizes social structures
   of adult Verreaux's sifaka more than female dominance. Future studies
   are needed to explore the influence of other sources of leverage and
   dominance, however. Similar studies in other primate species will
   clarify the role of what is often called ``dominance{''} but may
   actually be leverage-based power.},

Title = {Finding Meanings in Low Dimensional Structures: Stochastic Neighbor
   Embedding Applied to the Analysis of Indri indri Vocal Repertoire},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Simple Summary The description of the vocal repertoire represents a
   critical step before deepening other aspects of animal behaviour.
   Repertoires may contain both discrete vocalizationsacoustically distinct
   and distinguishable from each otheror graded ones, with a less rigid
   acoustic structure. The gradation level is one of the causes that make
   repertoires challenging to be objectively quantified. Indeed, the higher
   the level of gradation in a system, the higher the complexity in
   grouping its components. A large sample of Indri indri calls was divided
   into ten putative categories from the acoustic similarity among them. We
   extracted frequency and duration parameters and then performed two
   different analyses that were able to group the calls accordingly to the
   a priori categories, indicating the presence of ten robust vocal
   classes. The analyses also showed a neat grouping of discrete
   vocalizations and a weaker classification of graded ones.
   Abstract Although there is a growing number of researches focusing on
   acoustic communication, the lack of shared analytic approaches leads to
   inconsistency among studies. Here, we introduced a computational method
   used to examine 3360 calls recorded from wild indris (Indri indri) from
   2005-2018. We split each sound into ten portions of equal length and,
   from each portion we extracted spectral coefficients, considering
   frequency values up to 15,000 Hz. We submitted the set of acoustic
   features first to a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
   algorithm, then to a hard-clustering procedure using a k-means
   algorithm. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)
   mapping indicated the presence of eight different groups, consistent
   with the acoustic structure of the a priori identification of calls,
   while the cluster analysis revealed that an overlay between distinct
   call types might exist. Our results indicated that the t-distributed
   stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), successfully been employed in
   several studies, showed a good performance also in the analysis of
   indris' repertoire and may open new perspectives towards the achievement
   of shared methodical techniques for the comparison of animal vocal
   repertoires.},

Abstract = {In addition to its wide geographical distribution, osteoglossiform
   fishes represent one of the most ancient freshwater teleost lineages;
   making it an important group for systematic and evolutionary studies.
   These fishes had a Gondwanan origin and their past distribution may have
   contributed to the diversity present in this group. However, cytogenetic
   and genomic data are still scarce, making it difficult to track
   evolutionary trajectories within this order. In addition, their wide
   distribution, with groups endemic to different continents, hinders an
   integrative study that allows a globalized view of its evolutionary
   process. Here, we performed a detailed chromosomal analysis in
   Notopteridae fishes, using conventional and advanced molecular
   cytogenetic methods. Moreover, the genetic distances of examined species
   were assessed by genotyping using diversity arrays technology sequencing
   (DArTseq). These data provided a clear picture of the genetic diversity
   between African and Asian Notopteridae species, and were highly
   consistent with the chromosomal, geographical, and historical data,
   enlightening their evolutionary diversification. Here, we discuss the
   impact of continental drift and split of Pangea on their recent
   diversity, as well as the contribution to biogeographical models that
   explain their distribution, highlighting the role of the Indian
   subcontinent in the evolutionary process within the family.},

Abstract = {As the influence of climate change on tropical forests becomes apparent,
   more studies are needed to understand how changes in climatic variables
   such as rainfall are likely to affect tree phenology. Using a
   twelve-year dataset (2005-2016), we studied the impact of seasonal
   rainfall patterns on the fruiting phenology of 69 tree species in the
   rain forest of southeastern Madagascar. We found that average annual
   rainfall in this region has increased by >800mm (23\%) during this
   period relative to that recorded for the previous 40years and was highly
   variable both within and between years. Higher monthly measures of
   fruiting richness and the intensity of fruiting in our sample community
   were associated with significantly higher levels of rainfall. We also
   found that less rainfall during the dry season, but not the wet season,
   was associated with a significant shift toward later timing of peak
   richness and peak intensity of fruiting in the subsequent 12months;
   however, this pattern was driven primarily by an extreme drought event
   that occurred during the study period. Longer time scales of phenology
   data are needed to see whether this pattern is consistent. Madagascar is
   expected to experience more extremes in rainfall and drought with
   increasing climate change. Thus, the linkages between variable
   precipitation and the fruiting phenology of forest trees will have
   important consequences for understanding plant reproduction and the
   ability of Madagascar's wildlife to cope with a changing climate.
   Resume Vu que l'influence du changement climatique sur les forets

   enregistrees au cours des 40 annees precedentes, avec d'importantes
   variations inter- et intra-annuelles. Par ailleurs, les donnees montrent
   que la richesse ainsi que l'intensite de fructification de la communaute
   etudiee etaient significativement elevees suivant l'accroissement des
   taux de precipitations. Nous avons egalement constate qu'un faible taux
   de precipitations pendant la saison seche, mais pas pendant la saison
   humide, a pour consequence un decalage considerable sur les pics de
   fructifications durant les 12 mois qui suivent. Cependant, cette
   tendance a ete principalement causee par un episode de secheresse
   extreme survenu au cours de la periode d'etude. Des donnees
   phenologiques sur une plus longue echelle de temps devraient etre
   examinees afin de pouvoir evaluer si les variations observees sont
   constantes dans le temps. Selon des projections climatiques, il est
   estime que Madagascar fera face a des precipitations et des episodes de
   secheresse plus extremes avec le changement climatique. Ainsi, des
   etudes sur l'impact des variations des taux de precipitations sur le
   temps de reproduction des arbres forestiers auraient des implications
   considerables sur notre comprehension de la reproduction des plantes
   ainsi que la capacite de la faune malgache a faire face au changement
   climatique.},

Title = {Patterns of male dispersal in Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi)
   at Kirindy Mitea National Park},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {79},
Number = {7, SI},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Males of many group-living mammals emigrate from their social groups to
   improve mating opportunities. To help mitigate the social and locational
   costs of dispersal and to increase reproductive benefits, they may
   immigrate seasonally, immigrate alongside a partner, and/or replace the
   alpha male (versus entering a group as a subordinate). Verreaux's sifaka
   (Propithecus verreauxi) are highly seasonally breeding primates
   characterized by male-biased dispersal. We hypothesized that (i) males
   time immigrations to pursue immediate mating opportunities, (ii)
   entrances with partners more often result in alpha male replacement, and
   (iii) male competitive ability affects immigration strategy and alpha
   male tenure length. To assess these proximate aspects of male dispersal,
   we examined 7 years of demographic, morphological, and behavioral data
   for five social groups of Verreaux's sifaka in the Kirindy Mitea
   National Park in western Madagascar. Contrary to expectations and
   studies of sifaka dispersal in other populations, we detected no strong
   seasonal pattern in immigrations. Immigrations occurred individually and
   with partners, and a trend existed for partners to increase the
   likelihood of replacing an alpha male. Pronounced activity of the
   sternal scent gland (a proxy for testosterone and prior dominance
   status), but not body mass, canine size, or potential correlates of
   leaping ability, significantly influenced immigration strategy. The
   absence of a seasonal immigration pattern suggests that fluid group
   boundaries may allow mating success without establishment in a social
   group before the mating season. Our results also suggest that male
   immigration strategies are affected by age, prior dominance status, and
   testosterone levels but not morphological indicators of individual
   competitive ability. Coalitions may be used to improve competitive
   ability. Finally, differences in seasonal immigration patterns and
   length of alpha male vacancies observed at Kirindy Mitea may be due to
   the relatively low population density. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Title = {Minerals in the foods and diet of diademed sifakas: Are they nutritional
   challenges?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {79},
Number = {4, SI},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Minerals, though needed in small quantities, are essential to metabolic
   processes, and deficiencies can seriously threaten health, reproduction
   and survival. Despite this, few studies have measured mineral
   composition of wild primate foods and fewer have quantified mineral
   intake. Here we measured the concentration of nine minerals in 75 foods
   of diademed sifakas (Propithecus diadema; five groups) in habitats with
   varying levels of disturbance at Tsinjoarivo and estimated daily intakes
   using focal-animal feeding data and intake rates over one year. For six
   minerals (Ca, P, Na, Fe, Zn, and Cu), mean concentrations in foods fell
   short of the National Research Council's (NRC) recommendations for
   captive primates. Concentrations were highest in lianas, herbs, and
   epiphytes, and hemiparasites had exceptionally high Na. Leaves tended to
   have higher concentrations than fruits or flowers, but overlap was
   extensive. Mineral concentrations in daily diets varied little
   seasonally, but absolute intakes (g/day) were higher in the abundant
   season, due to the increase in food ingested. Disturbed habitat groups'
   diets had higher mineral concentrations for five minerals, but this
   translated into increased intakes only for Cu, as these groups ate less
   food overall. Overall, comparisons with percentage-based NRC
   recommendations suggests deficiencies, but this is contradicted by: (1)
   the fact that mass-specific intakes exceeded human recommendations, and
   (2) the lack of observed signs of deficiency. Ongoing efforts to
   quantify mineral consumption across wild primate populations and better
   understanding requirements on both a percentage and absolute basis will
   help in understanding effects on food selection, managing primate
   habitats and formulating captive diets.},

Volume = {43},

Pages = {273-283},

Abstract = {The role of wild meat for subsistence or as a luxury good is debated. We
   investigated the role of wild meat in food security in Madagascar, where
   consumption is poorly understood in urban areas and at regional scales.
   Using semi-structured interviews (n = 1339 heads-of-households, 21
   towns), we aimed to: (1) quantify the amount and purpose of, (2)
   understand the drivers of, and (3) examine changes in wild meat
   consumption. Few respondents preferred wild meat (8 +/- 3\%) but most
   had eaten it at least once in their lifetime (78 +/- 7\%). Consumption
   occurred across ethnic groups, in urban and rural settings. More food
   insecure areas reported higher rates of wild meat consumption in the 6-8
   months prior to interviews. Consumption was best explained by individual
   preferences and taboos. Less than 1\% of respondents had increased
   consumption during their lifetimes. Wild meat prices showed no change
   from 2005-2013. Most consumption involved wild pigs and smaller-sized
   animals, though they were consumed less in the years following the 2009
   coup. These data illustrate the differences between urban and rural
   communities, the occasions in which wild meat is used a source of food
   security, and provide evidence that some taxa are not hunted sustainably
   in Madagascar.},

Title = {Frugivores bias seed-adult tree associations through nonrandom seed
   dispersal: a phylogenetic approach},
Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {97},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2094-2102},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Frugivores are the main seed dispersers in many ecosystems, such that
   behaviorally driven, nonrandom patterns of seed dispersal are a common
   process; but patterns are poorly understood. Characterizing these
   patterns may be essential for understanding spatial organization of
   fruiting trees and drivers of seed-dispersal limitation in biodiverse
   forests. To address this, we studied resulting spatial associations
   between dispersed seeds and adult tree neighbors in a diverse rainforest
   in Madagascar, using a temporal and phylogenetic approach. Data show
   that by using fruiting trees as seed-dispersal foci, frugivores bias
   seed dispersal under conspecific adults and under heterospecific trees
   that share dispersers and fruiting time with the dispersed species.
   Frugivore-mediated seed dispersal also resulted in nonrandom
   phylogenetic associations of dispersed seeds with their nearest adult
   neighbors, in nine out of the 16 months of our study. However, these
   nonrandom phylogenetic associations fluctuated unpredictably over time,
   ranging from clustered to overdispersed. The spatial and phylogenetic
   template of seed dispersal did not translate to similar patterns of
   association in adult tree neighborhoods, suggesting the importance of
   post-dispersal processes in structuring plant communities. Results
   suggest that frugivore-mediated seed dispersal is important for
   structuring early stages of plant-plant associations, setting the
   template for post-dispersal processes that influence ultimate patterns
   of plant recruitment. Importantly, if biased patterns of dispersal are
   common in other systems, frugivores may promote tree coexistence in
   biodiverse forests by limiting the frequency and diversity of
   heterospecific interactions of seeds they disperse.},

Abstract = {Models of ecological community assembly predict how communities of
   interacting organisms may be shaped by abiotic and biotic factors.
   Competition and environmental filtering are the predominant factors
   hypothesized to explain community assembly. This study tested the
   effects of habitat, phylogenetic and phenotypic trait predictors on
   species co-occurrence patterns and abundances, with the endemic primates
   of Madagascar as an empirical system. The abundance of 11 primate
   species was estimated along gradients of elevation, food resource
   abundance and anthropogenic habitat disturbance at local scales in
   south-east Madagascar. Community composition was compared to null models
   to test for phylogenetic and functional structure, and the effects of
   phylogenetic relatedness of co-occurring species, their trait similarity
   and environmental variables on species' abundances were tested using
   mixed models and quantile regressions. Resource abundance was the
   strongest predictor of community structure. Where food tree abundance
   was high, closely related species with similar traits dominated
   communities. High-elevation communities with lower food tree abundance
   consisted of species that were distantly related and had divergent
   traits. Closely related species had dissimilar abundances where they
   co-occurred, partially driven by trait dissimilarity, indicating
   character displacement. By integrating local-scale variation in primate
   community composition, evolutionary relatedness and functional
   diversity, this study found strong evidence that community assembly in
   this system can be explained by competition and character displacement
   along ecological gradients.},

Abstract = {The activity patterns and social interactions of two species of captive
   sifaka were observed during a 2-year period. Allogrooming was not
   observed in golden-crowned sifaka and they spent significantly more time
   resting than the Coquerel's sifaka. Females of both species were found
   to be dominant to males. The golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus
   tattersalli) spent significantly less time feeding than the Coquerel's
   sifaka. Temperature, time of day, species, and interpair comparisons for
   the golden-crowned sifaka were found to affect activity and social
   interactions, while gender did not. Like the Coquerel's sifaka, the
   golden-crowned sifaka was found to be diurnal; however, they differed in
   that the golden-crowned sifaka did not descend to the ground. Zoo Biol.

Title = {Consumption of bushmeat around a major mine, and matched communities, in
   Madagascar},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {186},
Pages = {35-43},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Mining can have serious biodiversity consequences and many mining
   operations take steps to mitigate their impacts. Evaluating their
   success poses a significant challenge because appropriate
   counterfactuals (what would have happened in the absence of the mine)
   are often unavailable. We aimed to estimate the effects of education and
   enforcement measures carried out by a large mine in eastern Madagascar
   on local consumption of illegal bushmeat. We adopt a quasi-experimental
   approach and use an interview technique designed to reduce sensitivity
   biases to compare levels of consumption amongst mine employees and
   people living within the mine's intervention area with those of
   statistically matched control groups, and to relate differences to
   respondents' knowledge of relevant wildlife laws. Consumption was lower,
   and awareness of the law higher, amongst mine employees and those living
   in the mine's intervention area. However caution should be applied in
   interpreting these results as evidence of the effectiveness of
   anti-bushmeat efforts by the mine due to potential confounding factors:
   for example abundance of bushmeat species may vary between the study
   areas, and our method may not have completely removed the sensitivity of
   questions about illegal consumption. This illustrates the challenges of
   evaluating conservation impacts. We highlight the low level of
   understanding of wildlife laws, including among mine employees, and
   suggest better communication of these laws, as part of an education
   programme, could be a useful first step towards reducing illegal
   hunting. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {The interactions between primates and their snake predators are of
   interest because snakes have influenced the evolution of primate visual
   systems and predation has driven the evolution of primate behaviour,
   including group living. However, there are few accounts of primate-snake
   interactions in the wild. We report an incident from Northwest
   Madagascar in which a large female Madagascar ground boa (Acrantophis
   madagascariensis) captured an adult female Coquerel's sifaka
   (Propithecus coquereli); upon capture, the prey's group members
   proceeded to bite and scratch the snake until it released the prey,
   which survived. However, a broken mandible suffered by the boa during
   the incident led to its death by starvation 2 months later. Our
   observations demonstrate that, in addition to improved predator
   detection and deterrence (i.e., mobbing), active defence against some
   predators may provide an additional benefit to group living in
   Coquerel's sifaka, and suggest that predation on group-living primates
   may be more costly for predators than attacking a solitary species of
   similar body size.},

Abstract = {The locomotor behaviour of 2 groups of Propithecus verreauxi (Verreaux's

   Park (KMNP), Madagascar. This paper assesses the major characteristics
   of their locomotion, focusing on the extent that seasonal variation in
   climate and habitat, and local variation in habitat, is reflected in
   changes in locomotor behaviour. P. verreauxi is a committed leaper with
   a strong preference for vertical and angled supports. We found clear
   between-group differences in support orientation and diameter suggesting
   local variation in habitat. During the dry season, P. verreauxi utilizes
   smaller-diameter supports than in the rainy season. While this
   difference cannot yet be ascribed to any single cause, we discuss the
   factors which may contribute to this result.},

Title = {The molecular evolutionary dynamics of the vomeronasal receptor (class
   1) genes in primates: a gene family on the verge of a functional
   breakdown},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {Olfaction plays a critical role in both survival of the individual and
   in the propagation of species. Studies from across the mammalian clade
   have found a remarkable correlation between organismal lifestyle and
   molecular evolutionary properties of receptor genes in both the main
   olfactory system (MOS) and the vomeronasal system (VNS). When a large
   proportion of intact (and putatively functional) copies is observed, the
   inference is made that a particular mode of chemoreception is critical
   for an organism's fit to its environment and is thus under strong
   positive selection. Conversely, when the receptors in question show a
   disproportionately large number of pseudogene copies, this contraction
   is interpreted as evidence of relaxed selection potentially leading to
   gene family extinction. Notably, it appears that a risk factor for gene
   family extinction is a high rate of nonsynonymous substitution. A survey
   of intact vs. pseudogene copies among primate vomeronasal receptor Class
   one genes (V1Rs) appears to substantiate this hypothesis. Molecular
   evolutionary complexities in the V1R gene family combine rapid rates of
   gene duplication, gene conversion, lineage-specific expansions,
   deletions, and/or pseudogenization. An intricate mix of phylogenetic
   footprints and current adaptive landscapes have left their mark on
   primate V1s suggesting that the primate clade offers an ideal model
   system for exploring the molecular evolutionary and functional
   properties of the V1RS of mammals. Primate V1Rs tell a story of
   ancestral function and divergent selection as species have moved into
   ever diversifying adaptive regimes. The sensitivity to functional
   collapse in these genes, consequent to their precariously high rates of
   nonsynonymous substitution, confer a remarkable capacity to reveal the
   lifestyles of the genomes that they presently occupy as well as those of
   their ancestors.},

Abstract = {Primate field studies often identify lean seasons, when preferred foods
   are scarce, and lower-quality, abundant foods (fallback foods) are
   consumed. Here, we quantify the nutritional implications of these terms
   for two diademed sifaka groups (Propithecus diadema) in Madagascar,
   using detailed feeding observations and chemical analyses of foods. In
   particular, we sought to understand 1) how macronutrient and energy
   intakes vary seasonally, including whether these intakes respond in
   similar or divergent ways; 2) how the amount of food ingested varies
   seasonally (including whether changes in amount eaten may compensate for
   altered food quality); and 3) correlations between these variables and
   the degree of frugivory. In the lean season, sifakas shifted to
   non-fruit foods (leaves and flowers), which tended to be high in protein
   while low in other macronutrients and energy, but the average
   composition of the most used foods in each season was similar. They also
   showed dramatic decreases in feeding time, food ingested, and
   consequently, daily intake of macronutrients and energy. The degree of
   frugivory in the daily diet was a strong positive predictor of feeding
   time, amount ingested and all macronutrient and energy intakes, though
   season had an independent effect. These results suggest that factors
   restricting how much food can be eaten (e.g., handling time,
   availability, or intrinsic characteristics like fiber and plant
   secondary metabolites) can be more important than the nutritional
   composition of foods themselves in determining nutritional outcomesa
   finding with relevance for understanding seasonal changes in behavior,
   life history strategies, competitive regimes, and conservation planning.

Abstract = {Associations between the relative development of muscles of the forearm
   and hand of prosimian primates and locomotor behavior, body size, and
   grasping specializations have been made on the basis of qualitative
   observations. These associations are here tested through comparative and
   quantitative analyses of muscle mass data for a broad sample of
   prosimian species (i.e., strepsirrhines and tarsiers). The musculature
   of the forearm and hand of 17 fresh-frozen specimens representing six
   families and 12 species was dissected and weighed. Muscle weights were
   scaled relative to body mass of individual specimens using regression
   and compared by limb compartment and functional group. Forearm and
   digital flexor muscle masses are highly correlated with body mass (r =
   0.97 and r = 0.96, respectively) and scale isometrically. As a general
   trend within the prosimian sample, the relative mass of the flexor
   compartment increases with body size. Interspecific comparisons of
   functional groups of muscles did not identify any association between
   larger muscle mass and locomotor adaptations or grasping specializations
   of the hand. However, compared to other prosimians, the adductor
   pollicis muscle of Nycticebus is more developed (52\% of the intrinsic
   hand musculature sampled) and the flexor digitorum profundus muscle has
   two well-separated heads with more individualized tendons, with the
   pollex and digit IV receiving tendinous contributions from both muscle
   heads. These differences that characterize the forearm and hand of
   Nycticebus correlate with the extreme thumb divergence and pincer-like
   grips of lorises. Anat Rec, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Journal = {ILAR JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {54},
Number = {2},
Pages = {144-153},
Abstract = {The study of nonhuman primates (NHP) is key to understanding human
   evolution, in addition to being an important model for biomedical
   research. NHPs are especially important for translational medicine.
   There are now exciting opportunities to greatly increase the utility of
   these models by incorporating Next Generation (NextGen) sequencing into
   study design. Unfortunately, the draft status of nonhuman genomes
   greatly constrains what can currently be accomplished with available
   technology. Although all genomes contain errors, draft assemblies and
   annotations contain so many mistakes that they make currently available
   nonhuman primate genomes misleading to investigators conducting
   evolutionary studies; and these genomes are of insufficient quality to
   serve as references for NextGen studies. Fortunately, NextGen sequencing
   can be used in the production of greatly improved genomes. Existing
   Sanger sequences can be supplemented with NextGen whole genome, and
   exomic genomic sequences to create new, more complete and correct
   assemblies. Additional physical mapping, and an incorporation of
   information about gene structure, can be used to improve assignment of
   scaffolds to chromosomes. In addition, mRNA-sequence data can be used to
   economically acquire transcriptome information, which can be used for
   annotation. Some highly polymorphic and complex regions, for example MHC
   class I and immunoglobulin loci, will require extra effort to properly
   assemble and annotate. However, for the vast majority of genes, a modest
   investment in money, and a somewhat greater investment in time, can
   greatly improve assemblies and annotations sufficient to produce true,
   reference grade nonhuman primate genomes. Such resources can reasonably
   be expected to transform nonhuman primate research.},

Abstract = {In this research, we focused on aye-aye populations in Ranomafana
   National Park, Madagascar. From August to December 2008, we tested how
   aye-aye feeding was influenced by presence/absence of both fruiting and
   non-fruiting Canarium trees. Dead-wood feeding traces were used as a
   proxy for evidence of Canarium feeding. We enumerated deadwood feeding
   traces in 20 locations, 10 with Canarium, 10 without. Each location
   contained two transects (80 m L x 20 m W) for a total area of 5.6 ha.
   Feeding trace results for Canarium locations compared to non-Canarium
   locations were not significant (Z = -1.926, p = 0.083); however, feeding
   trace results were significant when comparing fruiting and non-fruiting
   Canarium locations (Z = -2.417, p = 0.016). These results highlight the
   importance of Canarium in the diet of aye-ayes and demonstrate how the
   distribution of this resource may influence the foraging behavior of
   aye-ayes. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {Payments for environmental services (PES) aim to improve the supply of
   environmental services by making payments to service providers, which
   are conditional on the provision of those services. Payments cannot be
   conditional unless the service can be effectively monitored, making
   monitoring of service provision a central feature of PES. We introduce a
   framework for designing monitoring programmes in PES schemes for
   biodiversity conservation. We suggest that decisions must be made
   concerning the indicators to be used (e.g. species, threats or positive
   actions), how they will be monitored (e.g. using ground-based or
   remote-sensed data) and how the monitoring information will be used to
   differentiate payments (e.g. trends over time, performance relative to
   neighbouring sites, performance against a target). We then use this
   framework to examine the feasibility of monitoring species and threat
   indicators in a community-based biodiversity payment scheme in Menabe,
   Madagascar. We find that detecting population changes, differences
   between sites, or whether a target has been met is only feasible for the
   most common indicators, suggesting that it may not be possible to base
   payments on the species conservationists are most interested in. If
   payments need to be based on relatively common indicators, threat
   indicators may be more appropriate than common species indicators due to
   a stronger relationship to the service of interest (presence of a rare
   species). It is, however, possible to incorporate information from rare
   indicators using accumulation curves to compare between sites. This
   study highlights the impact of indicator choice on the monitoring effort
   required in a biodiversity PES. We urge caution in the design of payment
   schemes and suggest it can be detrimental to structure a scheme around
   an indicator that cannot be effectively monitored. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {Gliding is thought to be an economical form of locomotion. However, few
   data on the climbing and gliding of free-ranging gliding mammals are
   available. This study employed an animal-borne three-dimensional
   acceleration data-logging system to collect continuous data on the
   climbing and gliding of free-ranging Malayan colugos, Galeopterus
   variegatus. We combined these movement data with empirical estimates of
   the metabolic costs to move horizontally or vertically to test this
   long-standing hypothesis by determining whether the metabolic cost to
   climb to sufficient height to glide a given distance was less than the
   cost to move an equivalent distance horizontally through the canopy. On
   average, colugos climb a short distance to initiate glides. However, due
   to the high energetic cost of climbing, gliding is more energetically
   costly to move a given horizontal distance than would be predicted for
   an animal travelling the same distance through the canopy. Furthermore,
   because colugos spend a small fraction of their time engaged in
   locomotor activity, the high costs have little effect on their overall
   energy budget. As a result, the energetic economy hypothesis for the
   origins of gliding is not supported. It is likely that other
   ecologically relevant factors have played a greater role in the origins
   of gliding in colugos and other mammals.},

Abstract = {The comprehension and usage of primate alarm calls appear to be
   influenced by social learning. Thus, alarm calls provide flexible
   behavioral mechanisms that may allow animals to develop appropriate
   responses to locally present predators. To study this potential
   flexibility, we compared the usage and function of 3 alarm calls common
   to 2 closely related sifaka species (Propithecus verreauxi and P.
   coquereli), in each of 2 different populations with different sets of
   predators. Playback studies revealed that both species in both of their
   respective populations emitted roaring barks in response to raptors, and
   playbacks of this call elicited a specific anti-raptor response (look up
   and climb down). However, in Verreaux's sifakas, tchi-faks elicited
   anti-terrestrial predator responses (look down, climb up) in the
   population with a higher potential predation threat by terrestrial
   predators, whereas tchi-faks in the other population were associated
   with nonspecific flight responses. In both populations of Coquerel's
   sifakas, tchi-fak playbacks elicited anti-terrestrial predator
   responses. More strikingly, Verreaux's sifakas exhibited
   anti-terrestrial predator responses after playbacks of growls in the
   population with a higher threat of predation by terrestrial predators,
   whereas Coquerel's sifakas in the raptor-dominated habitat seemed to
   associate growls with a threat by raptors; the 2 other populations of
   each species associated a mild disturbance with growls. We interpret
   this differential comprehension and usage of alarm calls as the result
   of social learning processes that caused changes in signal content in
   response to changes in the set of predators to which these populations
   have been exposed since they last shared a common ancestor.},

Abstract = {Colugos are arboreal folivores and are found in tropical rainforests of
   Southeast Asia. Despite their discovery roughly 200 years ago, colugos
   attracted relatively little scientific attention. Given the importance
   of population estimates in conservation decision-making, it is
   surprising that no colugo has been surveyed in tropical forest habitats.
   In this study, we assessed the possibility of using distance-sampling
   for estimating population size of Sunda Colugo (Galeopterus variegatus)
   in the protected forests of Singapore, and also compared this method
   with estimates from fixed-width strip transect. We found that key
   assumptions of distance-sampling were not violated and the method
   provided relatively more precise estimates than fixed-width strip
   transect. The population density estimate obtained was 0.535 (+/- 0.104)
   individuals per ha, and this translates to an estimated 1,074 +/- 209
   individuals within the 2,007 ha of protected forests in Singapore. We
   recommend the use of distance-sampling for the long-term monitoring of
   colugo populations and also discuss the viability of the species in
   Singapore.},

Title = {Comparative functional morphology of the primate peroneal process},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {57},
Number = {6},
Pages = {721-731},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The first metatarsal of living Primates is characterized by a
   well-developed peroneal process, which appears proportionally larger in
   prosimians than in anthropoids. A large peroneal process has been
   hypothesized to: 1) reflect powerful hallucal grasping, 2) act as a
   buttress to reduce strain from loads acting on the entocuneiform-first
   metatarsal joint during landing and grasping after a leap, and/or 3)
   correlate with differences in physiological abduction of the hallux. In
   this study, we address the latter two hypotheses by comparing the
   morphology of the peroneal process in 143 specimens representing 37
   species of extant prosimians, platyrrhine anthropoids, and tupaiids
   (tree shrews) that engage in different locomotor behaviors. In
   particular, we compare taxa, that vary in leaping frequency and hallucal
   abduction. Linear and angular measurements on the first metatarsal were
   obtained to evaluate differences in relative peroneal process thickness
   and length, first metatarsal abduction angle, and overall first
   metatarsal shape. Leaping frequency was significantly correlated only
   with relative peroneal process thickness within extant lorisoids.
   Relative process length was positively correlated with the angle of
   hallucal abduction within prosimians; this angle is significantly
   greater in prosimians than anthropoids. Multivariate analyses of
   metatarsal shape effectively separate species along phylogenetic lines,
   but not by locomotor behaviors. The hypothesis that the peroneal process
   on the first metatarsal reduces the loads on the entocuneiform-first
   metatarsal joint during landing after a leap is in part supported by
   data from extant lorisoids (i.e., slow quadrupedal lorises vs. leaping
   galagos). A peroneal process of greater length within prosimians may
   serve to increase the lever arm for the peroneus longus muscle in order
   to prevent hyper-abduction, followed by inversion in locomotor
   situations where the animal's weight is born on a highly
   divergent/abducted hallux. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Most mammal species show traditional patterns of sexual dimorphism
   (e.g., greater male size and aggression), the proximal mechanism of
   which involves the male's greater pre- and postnatal exposure to
   circulating androgens. But in several species, females diverge from the
   traditional pattern, converging on the male form or even reversing
   sexual dimorphisms. Such ``masculinized{''} females might show
   elongation of the clitoris, enhanced body size, and aggressively
   mediated social dominance over males, and they are interesting case
   studies for examining the role of androgens in females. This review
   addresses our understanding of the mediating mechanisms of morphological
   and behavioral development in both traditional and exceptional mammal
   species. Although certain lines of evidence implicate testosterone in
   female masculinization, the role for sex steroids in female development
   remains unclear. The results call for continued study of both hormonal
   and nonhormonal mechanisms of sexual differentiation, particularly
   focused on active processes of feminine development.},

Abstract = {Some species have potential for intense mate competition yet exhibit
   little or no sexual size dimorphism, despite predictions from sexual
   selection theory. Using a conceptual model, we show the conditions for
   which passive mate guarding with copulatory plugs can be an alternative
   and more successful strategy to active (direct) guarding, reducing
   selection pressure on large male size. The model predicts that
   copulatory plugs in mammals should be favoured in species for which
   females have short sexual receptivity periods. Using data on 62 primate
   species and a phylogenetic regression approach, we show that, as
   predicted, copulatory plugs are negatively associated with degree of
   sexual dimorphism and females' sexual receptivity length. Penile spines
   are also significantly associated with plug use and short receptivity
   periods suggesting a possible offensive role in sperm competition.
   Results highlight that life-history characteristics, such as sexual
   receptivity lengths, may alter the costs and benefits of alternative
   male strategies and thus alter the strength of sexual selection.},

Title = {Chest staining variation as a signal of testosterone levels in male
   Verreaux's Sifaka},
Journal = {PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {96},
Number = {4-5},
Pages = {586-592},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Male Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) exhibit variation in the
   staining of chest hair in association with the activity of the sternal
   gland. Scent-marking behavior and social relationships have been shown
   to vary with the state of chest staining. Research on other mammals
   suggests that sternal gland activity is modulated by testosterone. The
   goal of this study was to examine the relationship among fecal
   testosterone, testes mass, and chest staining in sifaka. I predicted
   that for sifaka (1) testosterone and testes mass are positively
   correlated, (2) stained males have higher testosterone and larger testes
   than clean-chested males, (3) testes mass is greater during the mating
   season than the birth season, and (4) testes mass is comparable to
   species with multimale mating systems. Eighty fecal samples were
   collected from eight adult males in five social groups in the Kirindy
   Mitea National Park of Madagascar during the mating season and analyzed
   using enzyme immunoassays. Males were captured during the mating season
   and the subsequent birth season to measure body mass and testes size and
   to document chest staining. Stained males had significantly higher IT
   and larger testes mass than clean-chested males. Testes mass was
   significantly greater during the mating season than the birth season for
   all males. However, the stained males exhibited less testes mass
   reduction during birth season than clean-chested males. These results
   suggest that the activity of the sternal gland is regulated by
   testosterone and that sexual selection has shaped male morphological
   variation in Verreaux's sifaka. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The size and composition of a social group can influence the
   reproductive success of its members. I examined the hypothesis that
   residents actively try to manipulate group size and composition in
   Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi). I collected
   behavioral data from 21 individuals in 5 social groups from November
   2000 to March 2002 in the Kirindy Forest (C.F.P.F.) of western
   Madagascar. I investigated the affiliative and agonistic behaviors of
   resident males and females toward other group members to determine
   whether residents attempt to manipulate the costs and benefits of group
   membership. I also examined 3 cases of immigration attempts and 1 case
   of emigration. As expected, group members facilitated the residency of
   subordinate members of the opposite sex. For example, females sought out
   the subordinate males, responded to their calls, and even groomed them
   more. However, intrasexual relationships were also important for
   establishing or maintaining residency. The data, in conjunction with the
   observations of immigration and emigration events, suggest that resident
   individuals of both sexes attempt to influence group size and
   composition. I suggest that single-male groups are not the norm in
   Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi because females encourage, and males do
   not discourage, multiple males to reside in the group to increase group
   stability and to reduce the risk of infanticide.},

Abstract = {The aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) possesses a highly
   specialized hand with two fingers, the third and the fourth, being used
   in a way unparalleled by any other primate. We observed the use of the
   third and the fourth fingers in various activities in four free-ranging
   aye-ayes. We found that the thin third finger was used exclusively or
   preferably for tapping, inserting into the mouth (probably for cleaning
   the teeth) and probing for nectar, kernels and insects in bamboo, twigs
   and live wood. In contrast, the robust fourth finger was used preferably
   when eating jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus). When probing for
   invertebrates in soft plant tissues and in dead wood, both fingers were
   used in high proportions. To extract the contents from coconuts, the two
   fingers were apparently used for different tasks. From this small (686
   observations), but unique, study of free-ranging aye-ayes, we conclude
   that the third finger appears to be specialized for use in tasks
   requiring high mobility, sensitivity and precision, whereas the fourth
   finger appears to be specialized for tasks requiring strength, scooping
   action and deep access.},

   exclusively at night may not need color vision nor have the capacity for
   it. Indeed, although the basic condition for mammals is dichromacy,
   diverse nocturnal mammals have only monochromatic vision, resulting from
   functional loss of the short-wavelength sensitive opsin gene. However,
   many nocturnal primates maintain intact two opsin genes and thus have
   dichromatic capacity. The evolutionary significance of this surprising
   observation has not yet been elucidated. We used a molecular population
   genetics approach to test evolutionary hypotheses for the two intact
   opsin genes of the fully nocturnal aye-aye (Daubentonia
   madagascariensis), a highly unusual and endangered Madagascar primate.
   No evidence of gene degradation in either opsin gene was observed for
   any of 8 aye-aye individuals examined. Furthermore, levels of nucleotide
   diversity for opsin gene functional sites were lower than those for 15
   neutrally evolving intergenic regions (> 25 kb in total), which is
   consistent with a history of purifying selection on aye-aye opsin genes.
   The most likely explanation for these findings is that dichromacy is
   advantageous for aye-ayes despite their nocturnal activity pattern. We
   speculate that dichromatic nocturnal primates may be able to perceive
   color while foraging under moonlight conditions, and suggest that
   behavioral and ecological comparisons among dichromatic and
   monochromatic nocturnal primates will help to elucidate the specific
   activities for which color vision perception is advantageous.},

Title = {Fitness and extra-group reproduction in male Verreaux's sifaka: An

Year = {2007},
Volume = {132},

Abstract = {Adult males in social groups often compete with other male group members
   for access to adult females. In some primate species, males also seek
   mating opportunities in neighboring social groups. Such extragroup
   fertilizations (EGFs) provide an additional source of variation in male
   fitness. This additional component of fitness provided by EGFs must be
   incorporated into analyses that investigate sources of variation in male
   lifetime reproductive success. In this study, a model is analyzed in
   which male fitness over a 10-year sample period is decomposed into
   additive and multiplicative variance and covariance components. The data
   come from an ongoing study of a wild population of Verreaux's sifaka
   (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) located at Beza Mahafaly Special
   Reserve, Southwest Madagascar. Paternity and demographic data for 134
   males are used to decompose male fitness into the following three
   multiplicative components: reproductive lifespan during sample period,
   fertility, and offspring survival. These multiplicative components are
   estimated for males reproducing within their resident groups plus (i.e.,
   the additive portion) for males reproducing in neighboring social
   groups. The analysis shows that variation in fertility makes the largest
   contribution to variation in total fitness, followed by variation in
   amount of time spent in sample period (which is a proxy of total
   reproductive lifespan) and variation in offspring survival. EGFs
   contribute an important source of variation to male fitness, and
   numerous factors enhance the opportunities for EGFs in male sifaka.
   These include female choice, a high degree of home range overlap, and a
   limited mating season.},

Title = {Kinematics of vertical climbing in lorises and Cheirogaleus medius},

Year = {2006},
Volume = {50},

Abstract = {The type of climbing exhibited by apes and atelines is argued to have
   been important in the evolution of specialized locomotion, such as
   suspensory locomotion and bipedalism. However, little is known about the
   mechanics of climbing in primates. Previous work shows that Asian apes
   and atelines use larger joint excursions and longer strides than African
   apes and the Japanese macaque, respectively. This study expands
   knowledge of climbing mechanics by providing the first quantitative
   kinematic data for vertical climbing in four prosimian species: three
   lorisid species (Loris tardigradus. Nycticebus coucang, and Nycticebus
   pygmaeus) that share with apes and atelines morphological traits
   arguably related to climbing, and a more generalized quadruped.
   Cheirogaleus medius. Subjects were videotaped as they climbed tip a
   wooden pole. Kinematic values, such as step length and limb excursions,
   were calculated and compared between species. The results of this study
   show that lorises, like Asian apes and spider monkeys, use relatively
   larger joint excursions and longer steps than does C. medius during
   climbing. These data lend further support to the idea that some primate
   species (e.g., lorises, atelines, and apes) are more specialized
   kinematically and morphologically for climbing than others. Pilot data
   suggest that such kinematic differences in climbing style across broad
   phylogenetic groups may relate to the energetics of climbing. Such data
   may be important for understanding the morphological and kinematic
   adaptations to climbing exhibited by some primates. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {In order to determine the extent to which the shape of the synapsid
   skull is adapted for resisting the mechanical loads to which it is
   subjected, block- or simple plate-shaped finite-element models were
   constructed and loaded with external muscle and bite forces in locations
   estimated to resemble points of application of these forces. These 2D or
   3D finite-element models were iteratively loaded and modified by
   removing elements that experience only low stresses, and the resulting
   morphologies of the models were compared with fossil skulls of synapsids
   and the skulls of extant mammals. The results suggest that the stress
   flows in these unspecific models are very similar to the arrangement of
   bone material in real skulls. Morphological differences between taxa
   depend on a few a priori conditions: length and position of the tooth
   rows in relation to the braincase, arrangement of muscles, position of
   the orbits, and position of the nasal opening. Given these initial
   conditions, finite-element analysis consistently reveals the close
   similarity between stress flows and real skulls. The major difference
   between mammal-like reptiles and primates is the size of the braincase.
   This difference accounts for most of the morphological divergence. The
   postorbital bar seems to be a constructional element of the skull,
   rather than a means to protect the eyes. The skull shapes of higher
   primates are determined mainly by masticatory forces and less by
   external forces acting on the head. This study demonstrates the utility
   of finite-element modeling for testing hypotheses regarding
   relationships between form and function in vertebrate skulls. (c) 2005

Abstract = {The genetic polymorphism of Malagasy prosimian populations is studied by
   using RAPD markers, The analysis includes two Lepilemur septentrionalis
   populations of the area of Analamera separated by a deforested hill
   crest and one population of L. dorsalis from the island of Nosy-Be. The
   genetic diversity is higher in the two populations of Analamera than in
   that of Nosy-Be and the level of genetic differentiation is higher
   between the population of L. dorsalis and the two populations of L.
   septentrionalis than between the two populations of L. septentrionalis
   themselves. Despite the hill crest separating the two populations of L.
   septentrionalis. our results demonstrate that they belong to one
   population, The respective roles of the geographical barriers and the
   reproductive barrier between the two species, are discussed.},

Abstract = {Wild populations of Eulemur macaco are substructured into small social
   groups or subpopulations in which the genetic variability can vary
   sharply as a consequence of the effects of evolutionary forces.
   Therefore, population genetic analysis of wild groups should be
   considered as the first step toward an optimal breeding programme.
   Examples of population structure and genetics are given for E. macaco
   populations of Nosy Be, Nosy Komba and Ambato (Yeti, Madagascar). The
   data show (1) a different degree of genetic variation between
   populations of the two islands (Nosy Be, Nosy Komba) and the mainland
   area of Ambato, (2) a closer genetic relatedness between E. macaco
   populations of Nosy Komba and Ambato (Yeti) and (3) different ecological
   conditions on Nosy Be in comparison with Nosy Komba and Ambato.},

Abstract = {Preuschoft et al. ({[}1993] in H. Preuschoft and D. Chivers (eds.):
   Hands of Primates. New York: Springer-Verlag, pp. 245-256) used a
   theoretical biomechanical analysis to generate several predictions
   relating subordinal differences in primate hand proportions to
   differences in carpal morphology. This study tests these predictions
   using quantitative analyses of carpal morphology between extant
   haplorhine and strepsirhine primates. Results show that living
   strepsirhines have a significantly larger hamate hamulus than do
   haplorhines, supporting Preuschoft et al.'s (1993) predictions. Extant
   strepsirhines also have a significantly shorter pisiform body than do
   haplorhines and arboreal nonprimate eutherians and a larger scaphoid
   tubercle than New and Old World monkeys. These results contrast markedly
   with those expected under Preuschoft et al.'s (1993) model. Furthermore,
   strepsirhines and haplorhines do not differ significantly in the
   relative size of their radiocarpal articulations. These morphometric
   observations do not match the predicted morphological patterns because
   the kinematic assumptions upon which the biomechanical models are based
   are incorrect. Living strepsirhines appear to be derived in having very
   deep radial and ulnar margins of the carpal tunnel for well-developed
   extrinsic digital flexors. Moreover, tooth-combed prosimians differ from
   most haplorhines, early Tertiary adapiforms, and arboreal nonprimate
   eutherians in having a relatively short pisiform body, which gives the
   flexor carpi ulnaris less power to flex the wrist from extended (=
   dorsiflexed) positions. These structural observations suggest that
   powerful manual grasping and an emphasis on leaping and climbing, rather
   than palmigrade quadrupedal walking and running, are morphotypic for
   extant Strepsirhini. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Satyrine butterflies in the subtribe Mycalesina constitute the largest
   radiation of butterflies in Madagascar (ca. 63 spp. out of ca. 300).
   Species definitions in this poorly known group have recently been
   clarified taxonomically and systematically. The patterns of spatial
   diversity in mycalesines have been analysed using William's program
   WORLDMAP on a quarter degree grid (spatial scale 27 x 27 km.). To
   compensate for sample effort inconsistencies, ranges were interpolated
   between range limits using two biological and three grid parameters:
   altitudinal range, habitat type and existing forest cover. The result
   for the distribution of mycalesine species is a fairly smooth gradient
   peaking at middle altitudes (ca. 900-1300 m.) and latitudes (ca. 17-20
   degrees S and 47-48 degrees E), with a hotspot which falls on the same
   quarter degree grid square as the well known eastern site of Perinet.
   Although not displayed by some taxa adapted to other biomes, this
   general pattern (and the approximate hotspot position) is shown by a
   wide range of taxa which include pronounced rainforest radiations or a
   high percentage of rainforest species (e.g. all butterflies other than
   mycalesines, hesperiid butterflies, frogs, two large radiations of
   frogs, and chameleons). This medially-centred latitudinal pattern does
   not reflect habitat area, grid cell altitudinal range or
   rainfall/temperature gradients, all of which tend to increase
   northwards. Rather, the pattern corresponds well to a random/uniform
   distribution of boundary-constrained range positions throughout the
   Madagascan rainforest. Diversity gradient studies for other taxa in
   Madagascar or elsewhere in the tropics need to take into account this
   effect of bounded range overlap richness. Conservation implications are
   briefly discussed.},

Abstract = {Eighty-five sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) have been captured, marked,
   released, and monitored between September 1984 and August 1988 at the
   Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve in southwest Madagascar. Estimates are
   presented of the age and sex structure of this population and of
   age-specific fertility and survival. Using data from this and other
   studies, it is shown that sifaka tertiary sex ratios do not depart
   significantly from 50:50, but that they do differ significantly from
   those of haplorhine primates, which have strongly female-biased tertiary
   sex ratios. Two demographic mechanisms that could give rise to this
   distinction are considered: 1) intermittently male-biased birth cohorts
   among sifakas and 2) different patterns of survivor-ship in haplorhines
   and sifakas.},

Title = {Testing mechanisms for weight support distribution during inverted
   quadrupedalism in primates},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL AND INTEGRATIVE
   PHYSIOLOGY},
Abstract = {A key characteristic of primate above-branch arboreal locomotion is
   hindlimb-biased weight support, subverting the typical mammalian
   condition in which the majority of the body weight is supported by the
   forelimb. This shift is thought to reflect an adaptation toward the
   arboreal niches exploited by early primates. However, above-branch
   quadrupedalism represents only one locomotor mode employed by primates
   in arboreal contexts. Inverted quadrupedal gaits, in which primates are
   suspended beneath branches by their hands and feet, have been documented
   in more than 50 primate taxa. This gait is characterized by a return to
   forelimb-biased weight distributions and a transition from peak vertical
   forces being greatest in the hindlimb to being greatest in the forelimb,
   which may occur to protect the hindlimb from high magnitudes of tensile
   loading when inverted. In this study, we compare kinetic and kinematic
   data during upright and inverted quadrupedalism in Lemur catta, Varecia
   variegata, Cebus capucinus, and Saimiri sciureus. These data are
   referenced against a classical inverted quadrupedal model: the two-toed
   sloth (Choloepus didactylus). Our findings show that inverted
   quadrupedalism in primates is differentiated from above-branch
   quadrupedalism by increases in forelimb weight support, forelimb contact
   times, and both forelimb and hindlimb joint excursions. Previously
   postulated biomechanical models outlining mechanisms relating to the
   control of weight support during upright walking do not translate well
   to inverted quadrupedal walking. We suggest that inverted primates may
   simply be adopting basal neuromuscular gait characteristics and applying
   them facultatively to this infrequent locomotor behavior.},

Title = {Do zoo-housed primates retreat from crowds? A simple study of five
   primate species},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Abstract = {An animal's welfare state is directly influenced by the mental state,
   which is shaped by experiences within the environment throughout the
   animal's life. For zoo-housed animals, visitors to the zoo are a large
   part of that environment and a fluctuating influence within it. This
   study examines the impact of zoo visitors on the space use of five
   species of zoo-housed primates (Eastern black-and-white colobus monkeys,
   Colobus guereza, n = 5, Allen's swamp monkeys, Allenopithecus
   nigroviridis, n = 2, DeBrazza's monkeys, Cercopithecus neglectus, n = 3,
   Bolivian gray titi monkeys, Callicebus donacophilus, n = 3, and crowned
   lemurs, Eulemur coronatus, n = 3). Specifically, we considered whether
   primates' distance from visitor areas changed as crowd sizes increased.
   Data were collected using the ZooMonitor app. Observers recorded spatial
   coordinates for each animal over periods ranging from 12 to 32 months.
   Data were analyzed using two types of regression models (linear and
   logistic) to examine the influence of visitors on the location of the
   primates. Both analyses revealed a statistically significant but small
   decrease in primate distance from visitor viewing glass as the number of
   visitors increased. Behavioral indicators of welfare were also
   unaffected by the presence of visitors. These results suggest that, with
   additional validation, distance from visitors may be one promising,
   simple way to evaluate the influence of visitors on primate welfare.},

Title = {The northern treeshrew (Scandentia: Tupaiidae: Tupaia belangeri) in the
   context of primate locomotor evolution: A comprehensive analysis of
   gait, positional, and grasping behavior},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL AND INTEGRATIVE
   PHYSIOLOGY},
Abstract = {The locomotor behaviors of treeshrews are often reported as scurrying
   ``squirrel-like{''} movements. As such, treeshrews have received little
   attention beyond passing remarks in regard to primate locomotor
   evolution. However, scandentians vary considerably in habitat and
   substrate use, thus categorizing all treeshrew locomotion based on data
   collected from a single species is inappropriate. This study presents
   data on gait characteristics, positional, and grasping behavior of the
   northern treeshrew (Tupaia belangeri) and compares these findings to the
   fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius) to assess the role of
   treeshrews as a model for understanding the origins of primate locomotor
   and grasping evolution. We found that northern treeshrews were primarily
   arboreal and shared their activities between quadrupedalism, climbing
   and leaping in rates similar to fat-tailed dwarf lemurs. During
   quadrupedal locomotion, they exhibited a mixture of gait characteristics
   consistent with primates and other small-bodied non-primate mammals and
   demonstrated a hallucal grasping mode consistent with primates. These
   data reveal that northern treeshrews show a mosaic of primitive
   mammalian locomotor characteristics paired with derived primate
   features. Further, this study raises the possibility that many of the
   locomotor and grasping characteristics considered to be ``uniquely{''}
   primate may ultimately be features consistent with Euarchonta.},

Abstract = {The emergence of new genes and functions is of paramount importance in
   the emergence of new animal species. For example, the insertion of the
   mobile element Tigger 2 into the sequence of the functional gene POU2F1
   in primates led to the formation of a new chimeric primate-specific
   isoform POU2F1Z, the translation of which is activated under cellular
   stress. Its mRNA was found in all species of monkeys, starting with
   macaques. Analysis of the fragments of the Tigger2 copy corresponding to
   the human exon Z showed that the splicing sites of exon Z are homologous
   in humans and in most monkeys, with the exception of lemurs and galagos.
   The stop codon introduced into the mRNA by the Tigger2 sequence is
   present in all primates, starting with macaques. The internal ATG codon
   is also present in all primates, with the exception of lemurs and
   galagos. In the course of evolution, other MGEs, mainly of the SINE
   type, were inserted into the Tigger2 copy. In the course of evolution,
   both the location and the number of mobile SINE elements within the
   POU2F1 gene changed. Starting with macaques, the pattern of the
   arrangement of SINE elements within the Tigger2 copy in the studied
   region of the POU2F1 gene was fixed and then remained unchanged in other
   primates and humans, which may indicate its functional significance.},

Abstract = {The TAR DNA Binding Protein (TARDBP) gene has become relevant after the
   discovery of its several pathogenic mutations. The lack of evolutionary
   history is in contrast to the amount of studies found in the literature.
   This study investigated the evolutionary dynamics associated with the
   retrotransposition of the TARDBP gene in primates. We identified novel
   retropseudogenes that likely originated in the ancestors of anthropoids,
   catarrhines, and lemuriformes, i.e. the strepsirrhine clade that inhabit
   Madagascar. We also found species-specific retropseudogenes in the
   Philippine tarsier, Bolivian squirrel monkey, capuchin monkey and
   vervet. The identification of a retropseudocopy of the TARDBP gene
   overlapping a lncRNA that is potentially expressed opens a new avenue to
   investigate TARDBP gene regulation, especially in the context of TARDBP
   associated pathologies.},

Title = {<p>Impact of COVID-19 and closed fishing season on commercial fishers of
   Davao Gulf, Mindanao, Philippines</p>},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Understanding the disruption of fishing activities due to COVID-19 and
   closed fishing season can provide an immediate reference for policy
   directions that help the government direct its resources to the most
   affected agricultural sectors. This study examined the impact of
   COVID-19 and closed fishing season on the commercial fishers' fishing
   operation and economic well-being in Davao Gulf, Mindanao. A total of N
   = 66 commercial fishers, 33 ringnet and 33 bagnet fishers were
   interviewed one-on-one in their homes and in the landing sites using a
   semi-structured questionnaire. Data was further validated using four
   focus groups in the study areas (N = 55). The findings of the study
   showed that the average catch per fishing trip for ringnet and bagnet
   fishers were 1,719 kg and 417 kg. The common catch species of ringnets
   were bigeye scad (Selar crumenophthalmus), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei),
   roundscad (Decapterus macrosoma), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis),
   and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). While the common catch species
   of bagnet fishers were roundscad (Decapterus macrosoma), Bali sardinella
   (Sardinella lemuru), moonfish (Mene maculata), short mackerel
   (Rastrelliger brachysoma), anchovy (Engrulidae), and bigeye scad (Selar
   crumenophthalmus). Both types of fishers operated at the height of the
   pandemic but met difficulties selling the fish due to travel
   restrictions. Thus, they had lesser income. Other impacts include
   disruption in their children's education, feeling fearful and
   frustrated. In addition, during the closed fishing season, the bagnet
   fishers find alternative livelihoods such as hired labor and
   construction. In contrast, ringnet fishers fish beyond the Davao Gulf
   and continue to do so until the closed fishing season ends.},

Title = {Reverse Chemical Ecology Suggests Putative Primate Pheromones},
Journal = {MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 7},
Abstract = {Pheromonal communication is widespread among living organisms, but in
   apes and particularly in humans there is currently no strong evidence
   for such phenomenon. Among primates, lemurs use pheromones to
   communicate within members of the same species, whereas in some monkeys
   such capabilities seem to be lost. Chemical communication in humans
   appears to be impaired by the lack or malfunctioning of biochemical
   tools and anatomical structures mediating detection of pheromones. Here,
   we report on a pheromone-carrier protein (SAL) adopting a ``reverse
   chemical ecology{''} approach to get insights on the structures of
   potential pheromones in a representative species of lemurs (Microcebus
   murinus) known to use pheromones, Old-World monkeys (Cercocebus atys)
   for which chemical communication has been observed, and humans (Homo
   sapiens), where pheromones and chemical communication are still
   questioned. We have expressed the SAL orthologous proteins of these
   primate species, after reconstructing the gene encoding the human SAL,
   which is disrupted due to a single base mutation preventing its
   translation into RNA. Ligand-binding experiments with the recombinant
   SALs revealed macrocyclic ketones and lactones as the best ligands for
   all three proteins, suggesting cyclopentadecanone, pentadecanolide, and
   closely related compounds as the best candidates for potential
   pheromones. Such hypothesis agrees with the presence of a chemical very
   similar to hexadecanolide in the gland secretions of Mandrillus sphinx,
   a species closely related to C. atys. Our results indicate that the
   function of this carrier protein has not changed much during evolution
   from lemurs to humans, although its physiological role has been
   certainly impaired in humans.},

Title = {Morphological disparity and evolutionary transformations in the primate
   hyoid apparatus},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {162},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The hyoid apparatus plays an integral role in swallowing, respiration,
   and vocalization in mammals. Most placental mammals have a rod-shaped
   basihyal connected to the basicranium via both soft tissues and a mobile
   bony chain-the anterior cornu-whereas anthropoid primates have broad,
   shield-like or even cup-shaped basihyals suspended from the basicranium
   by soft tissues only. How the unique anthropoid hyoid morphology evolved
   is unknown, and hyoid morphology of nonanthropoid primates is poorly
   documented. Here we use phylogenetic comparative methods and linear
   morphometrics to address knowledge gaps in hyoid evolution among
   primates and their euarchontan outgroups. We find that dermopterans have
   variable reduction of cornu elements. Cynocephalus volans are sexually
   dimorphic in hyoid morphology. Tupaia and all lemuroids except
   Daubentonia have a fully ossified anterior cornu connecting a rod-shaped
   basihyal to the basicranium; this is the ancestral mammalian pattern
   that is also characteristic of the last common ancestor of Primates.
   Haplorhines exhibit a reduced anterior cornu, and anthropoids underwent
   further increase in basihyal aspect ratio values and in relative
   basihyal volume. Convergent with haplorhines, lorisoid strepsirrhines
   independently evolved a broad basihyal and reduced anterior cornua.
   While a reduced anterior cornu is hypothesized to facilitate vocal tract
   lengthening and lower formant frequencies in some mammals, our results
   suggest vocalization adaptations alone are unlikely to drive the
   iterative reduction of anterior cornua within Primates. Our new data on
   euarchontan hyoid evolution provide an anatomical basis for further
   exploring the form-function relationships of the hyoid across different
   behaviors, including vocalization, chewing, and swallowing. (c) 2021

Abstract = {Egypt has limited agricultural land, associated with the scarcity of
   irrigation water and rapid population growth. Hydroponic farming,
   seawater desalination and magnetic treatment are among the practical
   solutions for sustaining rapid population growth. In this regard, the
   main objective of the present research study was to design and construct
   a hierarchical engineering unit as a hydroponic farming system
   (soilless) to produce an iceberg lettuce crop using magnetically treated
   saline water. The treatments included four types of irrigation water:
   common irrigation water (IW1) with an electrical conductivity (EC) of
   0.96 dS/m as a control treatment, magnetically treated common irrigation
   water (IW2) with an EC of 0.96 dS/m, saline water (IW3) with an EC of
   4.56 dS/m and magnetically treated saline water (IW4) with an EC of 4.56
   dS/m; three depletion ratios (DR) of field capacity (DR0 = 50\%, DR1 =
   60\% and DR2 = 70\%) and three slopes of hydroponic pipes (S-1 = 0.0\%,
   S-2 = 0.025\% and S-3 = 0.075\%). The results revealed that seawater
   contributed 7.15\% to produce iceberg lettuce in the hydroponic system.
   The geometric parameter, the slope of the pipes, influenced the obtained
   luminous intensity by an average increase of 21\% and 71\% for S-2 and
   S-3, respectively, compared with the zero slope (horizontal pipes).
   Magnetization of irrigation water increased the total soluble solids
   (TSS) and enhanced the fresh weight and water productivity of both
   iceberg lettuce varieties used. The maximum percentages of TSS were
   5.20\% and 5.10\% for lemur and iceberg 077, respectively, for the
   combination IW4DR2S2. The highest values of fresh weight and water
   productivity of 3.10 kg/m and 39.15 kg/m(3) were recorded with the
   combinations IW3DR2S3 and IW4DR1S3, respectively, for lemur and iceberg
   lettuce. The percentages of these increases were 109.46\% and 97.78\%,
   respectively, when compared with the combination IW1DR0S1. The highest
   values of iceberg lettuce 077 fresh weight and water productivity were
   2.93 kg/m and 36.15 kg/m(3), respectively, which were recorded with the
   combination IW4DR1S3. The percentages of these increases were 112.32\%
   and 120.56\%, respectively, when compared with IW1DR0S1 (the control
   treatment).},

Abstract = {Background Snakes and primates have a multi-layered coevolutionary
   history as predators, prey, and competitors with each other. Previous
   work has explored the Snake Detection Theory (SDT), which focuses on the
   role of snakes as predators of primates and argues that snakes have
   exerted a selection pressure for the origin of primates' visual systems,
   a trait that sets primates apart from other mammals. However, primates
   also attack and kill snakes and so snakes must simultaneously avoid
   primates. This factor has been recently highlighted in regard to the
   movement of hominins into new geographic ranges potentially exerting a
   selection pressure leading to the evolution of spitting in cobras on
   three independent occasions. Results Here, we provide further evidence
   of coevolution between primates and snakes, whereby through frequent
   encounters and reciprocal antagonism with large, diurnally active
   neurotoxic elapid snakes, Afro-Asian primates have evolved an increased
   resistance to alpha-neurotoxins, which are toxins that target the
   nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In contrast, such resistance is not
   found in Lemuriformes in Madagascar, where venomous snakes are absent,
   or in Platyrrhini in the Americas, where encounters with neurotoxic
   elapids are unlikely since they are relatively small, fossorial, and
   nocturnal. Within the Afro-Asian primates, the increased resistance
   toward the neurotoxins was significantly amplified in the last common
   ancestor of chimpanzees, gorillas, and humans (clade Homininae).
   Comparative testing of venoms from Afro-Asian and American elapid snakes
   revealed an increase in alpha-neurotoxin resistance across Afro-Asian
   primates, which was likely selected against cobra venoms. Through
   structure-activity studies using native and mutant mimotopes of the
   alpha-1 nAChR receptor orthosteric site (loop C), we identified the
   specific amino acids responsible for conferring this increased level of
   resistance in hominine primates to the alpha-neurotoxins in cobra venom.
   Conclusion We have discovered a pattern of primate susceptibility toward
   alpha-neurotoxins that supports the theory of a reciprocal
   coevolutionary arms-race between venomous snakes and primates.},

Title = {Biosynthesis of alpha-Gal Epitopes (Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc-R)
   and Their Unique Potential in Future alpha-Gal Therapies},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {The alpha-gal epitope is a carbohydrate antigen which appeared early in
   mammalian evolution and is synthesized in large amounts by the
   glycosylation enzyme alpha 1,3galactosyltransferase (alpha 1,3GT) in
   non-primate mammals, lemurs, and New-World monkeys. Ancestral Old-World
   monkeys and apes synthesizing alpha-gal epitopes underwent complete
   extinction 20-30 million years ago, and their mutated progeny lacking
   alpha-gal epitopes survived. Humans, apes, and Old-World monkeys which
   evolved from the surviving progeny lack alpha-gal epitopes and produce
   the natural anti-Gal antibody which binds specifically to alpha-gal
   epitopes. Because of this reciprocal distribution of the alpha-gal
   epitope and anti-Gal in mammals, transplantation of organs from
   non-primate mammals (e.g., pig xenografts) into Old-World monkeys or
   humans results in hyperacute rejection following anti-Gal binding to
   alpha-gal epitopes on xenograft cells. The in vivo immunocomplexing
   between anti-Gal and alpha-gal epitopes on molecules, pathogens, cells,
   or nanoparticles may be harnessed for development of novel
   immunotherapies (referred to as ``alpha-gal therapies{''}) in various
   clinical settings because such immune complexes induce several
   beneficial immune processes. These immune processes include localized
   activation of the complement system which can destroy pathogens and
   generate chemotactic peptides that recruit antigen-presenting cells
   (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells, targeting of antigens
   presenting alpha-gal epitopes for extensive uptake by APCs, and
   activation of recruited macrophages into pro-reparative macrophages.
   Some of the suggested alpha-gal therapies associated with these immune
   processes are as follows: 1. Increasing efficacy of enveloped-virus
   vaccines by synthesizing alpha-gal epitopes on vaccinating inactivated
   viruses, thereby targeting them for extensive uptake by APCs. 2.
   Conversion of autologous tumors into antitumor vaccines by expression of
   alpha-gal epitopes on tumor cell membranes. 3. Accelerating healing of
   external and internal injuries by alpha-gal nanoparticles which decrease
   the healing time and diminish scar formation. 4. Increasing
   anti-Gal-mediated protection against zoonotic viruses presenting
   alpha-gal epitopes and against protozoa, such as Trypanosoma,
   Leishmania, and Plasmodium, by vaccination for elevating production of
   the anti-Gal antibody. The efficacy and safety of these therapies were
   demonstrated in transgenic mice and pigs lacking alpha-gal epitopes and
   producing anti-Gal, raising the possibility that these alpha-gal
   therapies may be considered for further evaluation in clinical trials.},

Title = {Evidence of MHC class I and II influencing viral and helminth infection
   via the microbiome in a non-human primate},
Journal = {PLOS PATHOGENS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Until recently, the study of major histocompability complex (MHC)
   mediated immunity has focused on the direct link between MHC diversity
   and susceptibility to parasite infection. However, MHC genes can also
   influence host health indirectly through the sculpting of the bacterial
   community that in turn shape immune responses. We investigated the links
   between MHC class I and II gene diversity gut microbiome diversity and
   micro- (adenovirus, AdV) and macro- (helminth) parasite infection
   probabilities in a wild population of non-human primates, mouse lemurs
   of Madagascar. This setup encompasses a plethora of underlying
   interactions between parasites, microbes and adaptive immunity in
   natural populations. Both MHC classes explained shifts in microbiome
   composition and the effect was driven by a few select microbial taxa.
   Among them were three taxa (Odoribacter, Campylobacter and
   Prevotellaceae-UCG-001) which were in turn linked to AdV and helminth
   infection status, correlative evidence of the indirect effect of the MHC
   via the microbiome. Our study provides support for the coupled role of
   MHC diversity and microbial flora as contributing factors of parasite
   infection.
   Author summary The selective pressure of the major histocompatibility
   complex (MHC) on microbial communities, and the potential role of this
   interaction in driving parasite resistance has been largely neglected.
   Using a natural population of the primate Microcebus griseorufus, we
   provide correlative evidence of two outstanding findings: that MHCI and
   MHCII diversity shapes the composition of the gut microbiota; and that
   select taxa associated with MHC diversity predicted adenovirus and
   helminth infection status. Our study highlights the importance of
   incorporating the microbiome when investigating parasite-mediated MHC
   selection.},

Title = {SARS-CoV-2 and wastewater: What does it mean for non-human primates?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Abstract = {In most of our lifetimes, we have not faced a global pandemic such as
   the novel coronavirus disease 2019. The world has changed as a result.
   However, it is not only humans who are affected by a pandemic of this
   scale. Our closest relatives, the non-human primates (NHPs) who
   encounter researchers, sanctuary/zoo employees, and tourists, are also
   potentially at risk of contracting the virus from humans due to similar
   genetic susceptibility. ``Anthropozoonosis{''}-the transmission of
   diseases from humans to other species-has occurred historically,
   resulting in infection of NHPs with human pathogens that have led to
   disastrous outbreaks. Recent studies have assessed the susceptibility of
   NHPs and predict that catarrhine primates and some lemurs are
   potentially highly susceptible to infection by the severe acute
   respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. There is
   accumulating evidence that a new factor to consider with the spread of
   the virus is fecal-oral transmission. The virus has been detected in the
   watersheds of countries with underdeveloped infrastructure where raw
   sewage enters the environment directly without processing. This may
   expose NHPs, and other animals, to SARS-CoV-2 through wastewater
   contact. Here, we address these concerns and discuss recent evidence.
   Overall, we suggest that the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via
   wastewater is low. Nonetheless, tracking of viral RNA in wastewater does
   provide a unique testing approach to help protect NHPs at zoos and
   wildlife sanctuaries. A One Health approach going forward is perhaps the
   best way to protect these animals from a novel virus, the same way that
   we would protect ourselves.},

Title = {Individual-based networks reveal the highly skewed interactions of a
   frugivore mutualist with individual plants in a diverse community},
Journal = {OIKOS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {While plant-animal interactions occur fundamentally at the individual
   level, the bulk of research examining the mechanisms that drive
   interaction patterns has focused on species or population levels. In
   seed-dispersal mutualisms between frugivores and plants, little is known
   about the role of space and individual-level variation among plants in
   structuring patterns of frugivory and seed dispersal in a plant
   community. Here we use a zoocentric approach to examine how space and
   variation between individual plants affect movement and visitation by
   frugivores foraging on individual fruiting plants. To do this, we used a
   spatially explicit network approach informed by observations of the
   movement and foraging of a frugivorous lemur species Eulemur rubriventer
   among individual plants in a diverse plant community in Madagascar. The
   resulting hierarchical networks show a few individual plants receiving
   the bulk of the interactions, demonstrating that a generalist frugivore
   species could act as an individual-plant specialist within a plant
   community. The few individual plants that dominated interactions with
   lemurs shaped the modular spatial structure of frugivory interactions in
   the community and facilitated visitation to near neighbors. This
   interaction structure was primarily driven by extrinsic factors, as
   lemur movements among plants were significantly influenced by the
   individual plant's spatial position and the fruiting plant richness in
   its immediate neighborhood. Individual plants in central spatial
   locations with large fruit crops received the most visits. The observed
   inequality in the interactions of a generalist frugivore within a highly
   diverse plant community highlights the importance of considering
   individual-level variation for essential ecosystem processes such as
   seed dispersal.},

Title = {Reproductive one health in primates},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Abstract = {One Health is a collaborative trans-disciplinary approach to health;
   integrating human, animal, and environmental health. The focus is often
   on infection disease transmission and disease risk mitigation. However,
   One Health also includes the multidisciplinary and comparative approach
   to disease investigation and health of humans, animals, and the
   environment. One key aspect of environmental/ecosystem health is
   conservation, the maintenance of healthy, actively reproducing wildlife
   populations. Reproduction and reproductive health are an integral part
   of the One Health approach: the comparative aspects of reproduction can
   inform conservation policies or breeding strategies (in situ and ex
   situ) in addition to physiology and disease. Differences in reproductive
   strategies affect the impact poaching and habitat disruption might have
   on a given population, as well as ex situ breeding programs and the
   management of zoo and sanctuary populations. Much is known about
   chimpanzees, macaques, and marmosets as these are common animal models,
   but there is much that remains unknown regarding reproduction in many
   other primates. Examining the similarities and differences between and
   within taxonomic groups allows reasonable extrapolation for
   decision-making when there are knowledge gaps. For example: (1) knowing
   that a species has very low reproductive rates adds urgency to
   conservation policy for that region or species; (2) identifying species
   with short or absent lactation anestrus allows ex situ institutions to
   better plan contraception options for specific individuals or prepare
   for the immediate next pregnancy; (3) recognizing that progestin
   contraceptives are effective contraceptives, but may be associated with
   endometrial hyperplasia in some species (in Lemuridae but not great
   apes) better guides empirical contraceptive choice; (4) recognizing the
   variable endometriosis prevalence across taxa improves preventive
   medicine programs. A summary of anatomical variation, endocrinology,
   contraception, pathology, and diagnostics is provided to illustrate
   these features and aid in routine physical and postmortem examinations
   as well as primate management.},

   matter architecture across primate species phylogenetically close to
   humans, but few have compared the phylogenetically distant species.
   Here, we acquired postmortem diffusion imaging data from ring-tailed
   lemurs (Lemur catta), black-capped squirrel monkeys (Saimiri
   boliviensis), and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). We were able to
   establish templates and surfaces allowing us to investigate sulcal,
   cortical, and white matter anatomy. The results demonstrate an expansion
   of the frontal projections of the superior longitudinal fasciculus
   complex in squirrel monkeys and rhesus macaques compared to ring-tailed
   lemurs, which correlates with sulcal anatomy and the lemur's smaller
   prefrontal granular cortex. The connectivity of the ventral pathway in
   the parietal region is also comparatively reduced in ring-tailed lemurs,
   with the posterior projections of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus
   not extending toward parietal cortical areas as in the other species. In
   the squirrel monkeys we note a very specific occipito-parietal anatomy
   that is apparent in their surface anatomy and the expansion of the
   posterior projections of the optical radiation. Our study supports the
   hypothesis that the connectivity of the prefrontal-parietal regions
   became relatively elaborated in the simian lineage after divergence from
   the prosimian lineage.},

Title = {Pet primates for sale in the United States},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Our research goal was to investigate the primate pet trade in the United
   States. While dogs and cats are the most common type of pet, there are
   an estimated 15,000 pet primates in the United States and the demand for
   exotic pets in general has been rising. Most research on pet primates
   occurs in habitat countries and little is known about these pets in the
   United States. We collected data from six exotic pet-trade websites
   twice a month for 12 months. We recorded the type of primate for sale,
   sex, age, location, and price. We used Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit tests
   to compare whether the number of male and female pet primates for sale
   and the number of different age categories of pet primates for sale
   differed from equality and Spearman Correlation to examine associations
   between price and size and price and supply. We recorded 551 pet
   primates for sale between June 2019-June 2020, with 69.1\% platyrrhines,
   21.6\% strepsirrhines, and 8.9\% catarrhines. Marmosets were sold most
   often (36.7\%, N = 202) followed by lemurs (21.6\%, N = 119), capuchins
   (11.3\%, N = 62), and squirrel monkeys (10.5\%, N = 58). Almost
   two-thirds of the pet primates for sale were male (Chi-Square = 16.056,
   df = 1, P = 0. 00006) and 78.7\% were under one year old (Chi-Square =
   440.264, df = 2, P<0.00001). The median price was \$3,800 though price
   was highly variable, even for the same taxa. There are several potential
   drivers for the primate pet trade, including media influence,
   fashion/status, and profitable breeding though these are not mutually
   exclusive. Primates do not make good pets and even when captive-bred,
   pet primates impact the conservation of their wild counterparts.
   Advertisement campaigns focusing on disease transmission and legal
   consequences and a federal ban on pet primate ownership are two avenues
   to pursue to end the ownership of pet primates in the United States.},

Abstract = {Genetic variation of the endangered Puerto Rican crested toad (PRCT;
   Peltophryne lemur) has dwindled over time in both wild and captive
   populations, leading to long-term sustainability issues for the recovery
   program. To address this challenge, we propose that PRCTs can be used as
   a model species to show how in-situ and ex-situ populations can be
   linked through sperm biobanking and gamete transfer, expanding genetic
   variability of both populations. Male toads (n = 10) in Guayanilla,
   Puerto Rico were administered human chorionic-gonadotropin (hCG) and
   luteinizing-hormone-releasing-hormone analog (GnRHa) to stimulate
   spermiation. Sperm was collected noninvasively from 9/10 males,
   cryopreserved in 10\% trehalose with either 10\% N,N-dimethylformamide
   (DMFA) or 10\% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and transported in liquid
   nitrogen vapor to the National Amphibian Genome Resource Bank at
   Mississippi State University. Ultrasonography was used to identify
   females (n = 3) with mature oocytes for GnRHa-induced oviposition of
   eggs for in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Post-thaw sperm motility was 28\%
   and 25\% for sperm cryopreserved with DMFA or DMSO, respectively. Of the
   9,672 eggs used for IVF, 4\% (n = 306/6,981) were fertilized with
   frozen-thawed sperm, compared with 20\% (n = 525/2691) fertilized with
   fresh sperm controls. Overall, 46 toadlets were produced from
   frozen-thawed sperm. After 4.5 months of headstarting, 14 juvenile toads
   produced from various genetic crosses using frozen-thawed sperm were
   released to new sites in the wild, introducing unique genetic
   representation and new founder lines. After 1.5 years, 24 adult toads
   produced using frozen-thawed sperm continue to thrive in the captive
   collection, and one of these males has now produced an F2 generation of
   offspring with 5,085 tadpoles released to the wild. This
   transformational study is the first to produce reproductively viable
   adult PRCTs using cryopreserved sperm from hormonally-induced wild males
   and captive females, introducing innovative methods that link in-situ
   and ex-situ populations of endangered amphibians to revolutionize
   genetic management.},

Title = {Computed Tomography elucidates ontogeny within the basal therapsid clade
   Biarmosuchia},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 26},
Abstract = {Biarmosuchia is a clade of basal therapsids that includes forms
   possessing plesiomorphic `pelycosaurian' cranial characters as well as
   the highly derived Burnetiamorpha which are characterised by cranial
   pachyostosis and a variety of cranial bosses. Potential ontogenetic
   variation in these structures has been suggested based on growth series
   of other therapsids with pachyostosed crania, which complicates
   burnetiamorph taxonomic distinction and thus it is essential to better
   understand cranial ontogeny of the Burnetiamorpha. Here, three new
   juvenile biarmosuchian skulls from the late Permian of South Africa are
   described using X-ray micro computed tomography (CT). We found that
   juvenile biarmosuchians are distinguished from adults by their
   relatively large orbits, open cranial sutures, and incomplete
   ossification of the braincase and bony labyrinth. Also, they manifest
   multiple centres of ossification within the parietal and preparietal
   bones. CT examination reveals that the holotype of Lemurosaurus pricei
   (BP/1/816), previously alleged to be a juvenile, shows no evidence of
   juvenility and is thus probably an adult. This suggests that the larger
   skull NMQR 1702, previously considered to be an adult L. pricei, may
   represent a new taxon. This study provides, for the first time, a list
   of characters by which to recognise juvenile biarmosuchians.},

Abstract = {Bamboo is an enigmatic forage, representing a niche food for pandas and
   bamboo lemurs. Bamboo might not represent a suitable forage for
   herbivores relying on fermentative digestion, potentially due to its low
   fermentability. To test this hypothesis, guinea pigs (n = 36) were used
   as model species and fed ad libitum with one of three forages (bamboo,
   lucerne, or timothy grass) in a fresh or dried state, with six
   individuals per group, for 3 weeks. The nutrient composition and in
   vitro fermentation profile of bamboo displayed low fermentation
   potential, i.e. high lignin and silica levels together with a gas
   production (Hohenheim gas test) at 12 h of only 36\% of that of lucerne
   and grass. Although silica levels were more abundant in the leftovers of
   (almost) all groups, guinea pigs did not select against lignin on
   bamboo. Dry matter (DM) intake was highest and DM digestibility lowest
   on the bamboo forage. Total short-chain fatty acid levels in caecal
   content were highest for lucerne and lowest for grass and bamboo.
   Bamboo-fed guinea pigs had a lower body weight gain than the grass and
   lucerne group. The forage hydration state did not substantially affect
   digestion, but dry forage led to a numerically higher total wet gut
   fill. Although guinea pigs increased DM intake on the bamboo diet, the
   negative effects on fermentation of lignin and silica in bamboo seemed
   overriding. For herbivores that did not evolutionary adapt, bamboo as an
   exclusive food resource can be considered as inadequate.},

Abstract = {A total solar eclipse passed over the continental United States from the
   west to the east coast on 21 August 2017. Measurements made by more than
   2200 ground-based GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receivers
   observed a significant decrease in ionospheric total electron content
   (TEC). Meanwhile, radio occultation soundings from the
   LEMUR2-LYNSEY-SYMO satellite record a double-peaked feature in the
   scanned TEC profile. A reproduction of the double-peaked feature on the
   TEC profile shows that the solar eclipse depresses the electron density
   and simultaneously tilts the ionosphere. This study, in turn, indicates
   the combination of the International Reference Ionosphere model and the
   GNSS TEC is a powerful tool for observing ionospheric space weather.},

Title = {Mitochondrial Genomes from Two Specialized Subfamilies of Reduviidae
   (Insecta: Hemiptera) Reveal Novel Gene Rearrangements of True Bugs},
Journal = {GENES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Reduviidae, a hyper-diverse family, comprise 25 subfamilies with nearly
   7000 species and include many natural enemies of crop pests and vectors
   of human disease. To date, 75 mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of
   assassin bugs from only 11 subfamilies have been reported. The limited
   sampling of mitogenome at higher categories hinders a deep understanding
   of mitogenome evolution and reduviid phylogeny. In this study, the first
   mitogenomes of Holoptilinae (Ptilocnemus lemur) and Emesinae
   (Ischnobaenella hainana) were sequenced. Two novel gene orders were
   detected in the newly sequenced mitogenomes. Combined 421 heteropteran
   mitogenomes, we identified 21 different gene orders and six gene
   rearrangement units located in three gene blocks. Comparative analyses
   of the diversity of gene order for each unit reveal that the tRNA gene
   cluster trnI-trnQ-trnM is the hotspot of heteropteran gene
   rearrangement. Furthermore, combined analyses of the gene rearrangement
   richness of each unit and the whole mitogenome among heteropteran
   lineages confirm Reduviidae as a `hot-spot group' of gene rearrangement
   in Heteroptera. The phylogenetic analyses corroborate the current view
   of phylogenetic relationships between basal groups of Reduviidae with
   high support values. Our study provides deeper insights into the
   evolution of mitochondrial gene arrangement in Heteroptera and the early
   divergence of reduviids.},

Title = {Late Holocene spread of pastoralism coincides with endemic megafaunal

Volume = {288},

Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {Recently expanded estimates for when humans arrived on Madagascar (up to
   approximately 10 000 years ago) highlight questions about the causes of
   the island's relatively late megafaunal extinctions (approximately
   2000-500 years ago). Introduced domesticated animals could have
   contributed to extinctions, but the arrival times and past diets of
   exotic animals are poorly known. To conduct the first explicit test of
   the potential for competition between introduced livestock and extinct
   endemic megafauna in southern and western Madagascar, we generated new
   radiocarbon and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data from the bone
   collagen of introduced ungulates (zebu cattle, ovicaprids and bushpigs,
   n = 66) and endemic megafauna (pygmy hippopotamuses, giant tortoises and
   elephant birds, n = 68), and combined these data with existing data from
   endemic megafauna (n = 282, including giant lemurs). Radiocarbon dates
   confirm that introduced and endemic herbivores briefly overlapped
   chronologically in this region between 1000 and 800 calibrated years
   before present (cal BP). Moreover, stable isotope data suggest that
   goats, tortoises and hippos had broadly similar diets or exploited
   similar habitats. These data support the potential for both direct and
   indirect forms of competition between introduced and endemic herbivores.
   We argue that competition with introduced herbivores, mediated by
   opportunistic hunting by humans and exacerbated by environmental change,
   contributed to the late extinction of endemic megafauna on Madagascar.},

Title = {Comparative neuropathology in aging primates: A perspective},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {83},
Number = {11, SI},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {While humans exhibit a significant degree of neuropathological changes
   associated with deficits in cognitive and memory functions during aging,
   non-human primates (NHP) present with more variable expressions of
   pathological alterations among individuals and species. As such, NHP
   with long life expectancy in captivity offer an opportunity to study
   brain senescence in the absence of the typical cellular pathology caused
   by age-related neurodegenerative illnesses commonly seen in humans.
   Age-related changes at neuronal population, single cell, and synaptic
   levels have been well documented in macaques and marmosets, while
   age-related and Alzheimer's disease-like neuropathology has been
   characterized in additional species including lemurs as well as great
   apes. We present a comparative overview of existing neuropathologic
   observations across the primate order, including classic age-related
   changes such as cell loss, amyloid deposition, amyloid angiopathy, and
   tau accumulation. We also review existing cellular and ultrastructural
   data on neuronal changes, such as dendritic attrition and spine
   alterations, synaptic loss and pathology, and axonal and myelin
   pathology, and discuss their repercussions on cellular and systems
   function and cognition.},

Title = {Zoo Visitor Attitudes Are More Influenced by Animal Behaviour than
   Environmental Enrichment Appearance},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Environmental enrichment is a combination of techniques
   that aim to improve the quality of life of zoo animals. However,
   institutions might be reluctant to add certain enrichment items due to
   the belief that their presence could negatively affect the visitor
   experience in the zoo. To explore the veracity of this belief, we
   assessed visitor attitudes towards two types of enrichment items
   (naturalistic vs. artificial looking) in an outdoor walk-through
   enclosure for ring-tailed lemurs in Zoo Planckendael (Belgium). We
   developed a questionnaire that was answered by 371 visitors. We also
   took into consideration the behaviour of the animals and their
   visibility. We found that the visitor attitudes were more influenced by
   the behaviours displayed by the lemurs than the appearance of the
   enrichment items. We suggest that more emphasis should be placed on
   designing enrichment items that provide the animals with opportunities
   to display more active and appropriate behaviours, regardless of the
   appearance of the objects, in order to improve animal welfare while
   simultaneously improving the visitor experience. Decisions on
   environmental enrichment programmes are sometimes based on the
   assumption that non-natural or artificial looking items negatively
   affect visitor experiences. In this study, we developed a questionnaire
   to assess zoo visitor attitudes towards enrichment appearance in an
   outdoor walk-through enclosure for ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta).
   Naturalistic and artificial looking enrichment items were alternately
   provided in the enclosure. A total of 371 visitors filled out the
   questionnaire: 174 in the naturalistic and 197 in the artificial
   conditions. Both researchers and visitors conducted behavioural
   observations of the lemurs. Our results suggest that the appearance of
   the items did not have an effect on visitor attitudes and that visitors
   recognised both naturalistic and artificial items as enriching for the
   animals. Moreover, the behaviour and visibility of the lemurs had a
   greater effect on the visitors' attitudes. We suggest that during the
   design of enrichment items, less concern should be placed on the
   appearance of the items and more on their effect on animal behaviour.
   Ultimately, this would improve both animal welfare in captivity and the
   visitor experience.},

Title = {Ecological Consequences of a Millennium of Introduced Dogs on Madagascar},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Introduced predators currently threaten endemic animals on Madagascar
   through predation, facilitation of human-led hunts, competition, and
   disease transmission, but the antiquity and past consequences of these
   introductions are poorly known. We use directly radiocarbon dated bones
   of introduced dogs (Canis familiaris) to test whether dogs could have
   aided human-led hunts of the island's extinct megafauna. We compare
   carbon and nitrogen isotope data from the bone collagen of dogs and
   endemic ``fosa{''} (Cryptoprocta spp.) in central and southwestern
   Madagascar to test for competition between introduced and endemic
   predators. The distinct isotopic niches of dogs and fosa suggest that
   any past antagonistic relationship between these predators did not
   follow from predation or competition for shared prey. Radiocarbon dates
   confirm that dogs have been present on Madagascar for over a millennium
   and suggest that they at least briefly co-occurred with the island's
   extinct megafauna, which included giant lemurs, elephant birds, and
   pygmy hippopotamuses. Today, dogs share a mutualism with pastoralists
   who also occasionally hunt endemic vertebrates, and similar behavior is
   reflected in deposits at several Malagasy paleontological sites that
   contain dog and livestock bones along with butchered bones of extinct
   megafauna and extant lemurs. Dogs on Madagascar have had a wide range of
   diets during the past millennium, but relatively high stable carbon
   isotope values suggest few individuals relied primarily on forest
   bushmeat. Our newly generated data suggest that dogs were part of a
   suite of animal introductions beginning over a millennium ago that
   coincided with widespread landscape transformation and megafaunal
   extinction.},

Title = {A New Late Permian Burnetiamorph From Zambia Confirms Exceptional Levels
   of Endemism in Burnetiamorpha (Therapsida: Biarmosuchia) and an Updated
   Paleoenvironmental Interpretation of the Upper Madumabisa Mudstone
   Formation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {A new burnetiamorph therapsid, Isengops luangwensis, gen. et sp. nov.,
   is described on the basis of a partial skull from the upper Madumabisa
   Mudstone Formation of the Luangwa Basin of northeastern Zambia. Isengops
   is diagnosed by reduced palatal dentition, a ridge-like
   palatine-pterygoid boss, a palatal exposure of the jugal that extends
   far anteriorly, a tall trigonal pyramid-shaped supraorbital boss, and a
   recess along the dorsal margin of the lateral temporal fenestra. The
   upper Madumabisa Mudstone Formation was deposited in a rift basin with
   lithofacies characterized by unchannelized flow, periods of subaerial
   desiccation and non-deposition, and pedogenesis, and can be
   biostratigraphically tied to the upper Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone of
   South Africa, suggesting a Wuchiapingian age. Isengops is the second
   burnetiamorph recognized from Zambia and is part of a tetrapod
   assemblage remarkably similar to others across southern Pangea during
   the Wuchiapingian. A revised cladistic analysis of Biarmosuchia yielded
   over 500 most parsimonious trees that generally reaffirm the results of
   previous analyses for burnetiamorphs: Lemurosaurus is basal, Lobalopex
   and Isengops are proximate burnetiid outgroups, and Bullacephalus,
   Burnetia, Mobaceras, Niuksenitia, and Pachydectes are burnetiines.
   Furthermore, Russian biarmosuchians are scattered throughout the tree
   and do not form sister taxon relationships with each other.
   Burnetiamorphs display a wide disparity of cranial adornments and are
   relatively speciose (13 species), especially when compared to the number
   of specimens discovered to date (similar to 16 specimens). As has been
   suggested in some other tetrapod clades (e.g., ceratopsian dinosaurs),
   the burnetiamorph fossil record supports an inferred macroevolutionary
   relationship between cranial adornment and increased speciation rate.},

Abstract = {Lemur Tail (former tyrosine) Kinases (LMTKs) comprise a novel family of
   regulated serine/threonine specific kinases with three structurally and
   evolutionary related members. LMTKs exercise a confusing variety of
   cytosolic functions in cell signalling and membrane trafficking.
   Moreover, LMTK2 and LMTK3 also reside in the nucleus where they
   participate in gene transcription/regulation. As a consequence, LMTKs
   impact cell proliferation and apoptosis, cell growth and
   differentiation, as well as cell migration. All these fundamental cell
   behaviours can turn awry, most prominently during neuropathologies and
   tumour biogenesis. In cancer cells, LMTK levels are often correlated
   with poor overall prognosis and therapy outcome, not least owned to
   acquired drug resistance. In brain tissue, LMTKs are highly expressed
   and have been linked to neuronal and glia cell differentiation and cell
   homeostasis. For one member of the LMTK-family (LMTK2) a role in cystic
   fibrosis has been identified. Due to their role in fundamental cell
   processes, altered LMTK physiology may also warrant a hitherto
   unappreciated role in other diseases, and expose them as potential
   valuable drug targets.
   On the backdrop of a compendium of LMTK cell functions, we hypothesize
   that the primary role of LMTKs may dwell within the endocytic cargo
   recycling and/or nuclear receptor transport pathways.},

Title = {PREVALENCE OF LAWSONIA INTRACELLULARIS INFECTION IN NONHUMAN PRIMATES

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {In 2016 and 2017, Lawsonia intracellularis was isolated from several
   pileated gibbons (Hylobates pileatus) presenting with diarrhea in
   Mulhouse Zoo (eastern France). To this day, infection with this
   bacterium has rarely been described in nonhuman primates (NHP) in
   captivity or in the wild and there are no data about the prevalence or
   transmission of the disease. This study focuses on finding the
   prevalence of this infection amongst Mulhouse Zoo's N HP collection and
   trying to identify a source of contamination responsible for this
   epizooty. Forty-eight real-time PCR were conducted on feces from all NHP
   species in the zoo and on small mammals trapped in the NHP housing
   structures. No NHP was experiencing symptoms at the time of the study,
   however test results showed that Lawsonia intracellularis can be found
   in 61.76\% (21/34) of the group total (n = 34) and the prevalence even
   increases to 92.3\% (12/13) in the Lemuriform infraorder (n = 13). In
   small mammals (n = 14), prevalence of the bacterium is 57.17\% (8/14)
   including 77.78\% in rodents (7/9). The results of this study show that
   several NHP species are healthy carriers and some species of small
   mammals can be considered as a potential source of contamination.
   Because of the difficulty encountered trying to isolate the bacterium,
   it is plausible that infections caused by Lawsonia intracellularis have
   been underdiagnosed to this day, and that it could be an emerging
   disease in Europe. Therefore, using real-time PCR to search for this
   bacterium seems essential in case of diarrhea occurring in nonhuman
   primates. Moreover, even though further studies on contamination sources
   need to be conducted, the issue of the presence of rodents in NHP
   housing structures has to be taken very seriously and tackled with the
   utmost care.},

Title = {Untangling Tales of Tropical Sardines: Local Knowledge From Fisheries in
   Timor-Leste},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 13},
Abstract = {Tropical sardines (Family Clupeidae) are an important component of many
   marine fisheries in the Indo-West Pacific region. In Timor-Leste, a
   small, less-developed country within this region, `sardina' are some of
   the more commonly caught and consumed fish. Yet there is little
   published information from Timor-Leste about the species composition of
   these fisheries, nor their biology or ecology. We document the knowledge
   of Timorese fishers on nine locally distinguished sardine types that
   contribute to fisheries, and relate these to at least nine species: four
   species of `Flat-bodied Sardinellas' (Sardinela subg. Clupeonia spp.),
   one species of `Round-bodied Sardinella' (Sardinella subg. Sardinella
   lemuru), two species of `Tropical Pilchards' (Amblygaster spp.) and a
   `Tropical Herring' species (Herklotsichthys quadrimaculatus), all from
   the Clupeidae family; and one Dussumieria species from the
   Dussumieriidae family. We record variations in local sardine names
   across the country and document aspects of fishers' knowledge relevant
   to understanding and managing the fisheries, including local sardine
   species' seasonality, habitat, movements, interannual variation, as well
   as post-harvest characteristics in relation to perishability. In
   general, local names relate more closely with groups of species than
   individual species, although some names also distinguish fish size
   within species-groups. The local knowledge identified in this study has
   immediate application to inform fisheries monitoring and management, and
   to identify areas for future research. Notably, Timorese fishers
   recognize and make use of the strong association between some sardine
   species-groups and seasonally turbid river plumes. While further
   research is required to understand the underlying mechanisms of this
   association, this emphasizes the need to consider coastal fisheries and
   fisher livelihood impacts when assessing any plans or proposals that may
   alter river flow or water quality. Fishers also recognize migratory
   behavior of some sardine species, in particular the Flat bodied
   Sardinellas (S. gibbosa and others) along the northwest coast of
   Timor-Leste and across the border into Indonesian West Timor. Such
   insights complicate and need to be accounted for in initiatives for
   co-management or community-based management of Timor-Leste's coastal
   waters and their fisheries.},

Abstract = {Deleterious effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity
   have been demonstrated in numerous taxa. Although parasites represent a
   large part of worldwide biodiversity, they are mostly neglected in this
   context. We investigated the effects of various anthropogenic
   environmental changes on gastrointestinal parasite infections in four
   small mammal hosts inhabiting two landscapes of fragmented dry forest in
   northwestern Madagascar. Coproscopical examinations were performed on
   1,418 fecal samples from 903 individuals of two mouse lemur species,
   Microcebus murinus (n = 199) and M. ravelobensis (n = 421), and two
   rodent species, the native Eliurus myoxinus (n = 102) and the invasive
   Rattus rattus (n = 181). Overall, sixteen parasite morphotypes were
   detected and significant prevalence differences between host species
   regarding the most common five parasites may be explained by
   parasite-host specificity or host behavior, diet, and socioecology. Ten
   host- and habitat-related ecological variables were evaluated by
   generalized linear mixed modeling for significant impacts on the
   prevalence of the most abundant gastrointestinal parasites and on
   gastrointestinal parasite species richness (GPSR). Forest maturation
   affected homoxenous parasites (direct life cycle) by increasing
   Lemuricola, but decreasing Enterobiinae gen. sp. prevalence, while
   habitat fragmentation and vegetation clearance negatively affected the
   prevalence of parasites with heterogenic environment (i.e.,
   Strongyloides spp.) or heteroxenous (indirect cycle with intermediate
   host) cycles, and consequently reduced GPSR. Forest edges and forest
   degradation likely change abiotic conditions which may reduce habitat
   suitability for soil-transmitted helminths or required intermediate
   hosts. The fragility of complex parasite life cycles suggests
   understudied and potentially severe effects of decreasing habitat
   quality by fragmentation and degradation on hidden ecological networks
   that involve parasites. Since parasites can provide indispensable
   ecological services and ensure stability of ecosystems by modulating
   animal population dynamics and nutrient pathways, our study underlines
   the importance of habitat quality and integrity as key aspects of
   conservation.},

Title = {The biology and ecology of tropical marine sardines and herrings in
   Indo-West Pacific fisheries: a review},

Abstract = {Tropical sardines and herrings (Family Clupeidae) form important
   fisheries resources in the Indo-West Pacific region. However knowledge
   of their biology and ecology is largely scattered across diverse
   localised studies. In addition, their challenging taxonomy due to
   numerous, morphologically similar species, coupled with data collected
   from dispersed, often small-scale and mixed species fisheries, creates
   difficulties for comparing species-level research and fisheries
   statistics across the region. This review considers four main groups of
   tropical marine clupeid species important for Indo-West Pacific
   fisheries-Sardinella (subg. Sardinella) species ('Round-bodied
   Sardinellas'), Sardinella (subg. Clupeonia) species ('Flat-bodied
   Sardinellas'), Amblygaster species ('Tropical Pilchards'), and
   Herklotsichthys and Escualosa species ('Tropical Herrings')-and collates
   and synthesises existing knowledge on early life history, reproduction,
   trophic biology, habitat associations and population dynamics. Most
   research on tropical clupeid biology and ecology in the Indo-West
   Pacific is concentrated on the Round-bodied Sardinellas (S. longiceps
   and S. lemuru) from a few major fishery locations; other species-groups
   have been studied sporadically across their distributions.
   Characteristics such as maximum size, life span, size at first maturity
   and some habitat associations are generally similar within
   species-groups and differ between groups. However differences within the
   same reported species highlight the importance of continued work to
   improve taxonomic identification. There remain substantial gaps in
   knowledge on all species-groups. Regular critical review of specific
   research topics, such as reproductive parameters and population
   dynamics, would assist to standardise methods and terminology used,
   enable consolidation and comparison of findings, identify local research
   agenda, and help build and improve research on these important tropical
   species.},

Title = {Differential Gene Expression Analysis Reveals Global LMTK2 Regulatory
   Network and Its Role in TGF-beta 1 Signaling},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 18},
Abstract = {Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) is a transmembrane Ser/Thr kinase whose
   role has been increasingly recognized; however, when compared to other
   kinases, understanding of the LMTK2 networks and biological functions is
   still limited. Recent data have shown that transforming growth factor
   (TGF)-beta 1 plays a role in modulating LMTK2 function by controlling
   its endocytic trafficking in human bronchial epithelial cells. Here, we
   aimed to unveil the LMTK2 regulatory network and elucidate how it
   affects cellular functions and disease pathways in either TGF-beta 1
   dependent or independent manner. To understand how the LMTK2 and
   TGF-beta 1 pathways interconnect, we knocked down (KD) LMTK2 using
   small(si)RNA-mediated silencing in human bronchial epithelial CFBE41o-
   cells, treated cells with TGF-beta 1 or vehicle control, and performed
   differential gene expression analysis by RNA sequencing (RNAseq). In
   vehicle-treated cells, LMTK2 KD affected expression of 2,506 genes while
   it affected 4,162 genes after TGF-beta 1 stimulation. Bioinformatics
   analysis shows that LMTK2 is involved in diverse cellular functions and
   disease pathways, such as cell death and survival, cellular development,
   and cancer susceptibility. In summary, our study increases current
   knowledge about the LMTK2 network and its intersection with the TGF-beta
   1 signaling pathway. These findings will serve as basis for future
   exploration of the predicted LMTK2 interactions and signaling pathways.},

Abstract = {Vocal and gestural sequences of several primates have been found to
   conform to two general principles of information compression: the
   compensation between the duration of a construct and that of its
   components (Menzerath-Altmann law) and an inverse relationship between
   signal duration and its occurrence (Zipf's law of abbreviation). Even
   though Zipf's law of brevity has been proposed as a universal in animal
   communication, evidence on non-human primate vocal behavior conformity
   to linguistic laws is still debated, and information on strepsirrhine
   primates is lacking. We analyzed the vocal behavior of the unique
   singing lemur species (Indri indri) to assess whether the song of the
   species shows evidence for compression. As roars have a chaotic
   structure that impedes the recognition of each individual utterance, and
   long notes are usually given by males, we focused on the core part of
   the song (i.e., the descending phrases, composed of two-six units). Our
   results indicate that indris' songs conform to Zipf's and
   Menzerath-Altmann linguistic laws. Indeed, shorter phrases are more
   likely to be included in the song, and units' duration decrease at the
   increase of the size of the phrases. We also found that, despite a
   sexual dimorphism in the duration of both units and phrases, these laws
   characterize sequences of both males and females. Overall, we provide
   the first evidence for a trade-off between signal duration and
   occurrence in the vocal behavior of a strepsirrhine species, suggesting
   that selective pressures for vocal compression are more ancestral than
   previously assumed within primates.},

Abstract = {Captive breeding is vital for primate conservation, with modern zoos
   serving a crucial role in breeding populations of threatened species and
   educating the general public. However, captive populations can
   experience welfare issues that may also undermine their reproductive
   success. To enhance the wellbeing of endangered zoo primates, we
   conducted a study to assess the effects of a new scent enrichment
   program on captive red-ruffed lemurs (Varecia rubra), black howler
   monkeys (Alouatta caraya), siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus), lar
   gibbons (Hylobates lar) and orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus). We
   combined behavioral observations and fecal endocrinology analyses to
   evaluate the effects of a series of essential oils (benzoin, lavender,
   lemongrass) on five captive troops (N = 19) housed at Dudley Zoo \&
   Castle and Twycross Zoo (UK). We recorded observations of natural
   species-specific and abnormal stress-related behaviors for 480 h using
   instantaneous scan sampling. We collected 189 fecal samples and measured
   the fecal cortisol concentrations using radioimmunoassay. We found a
   significant effect of the scent enrichment on behaviors, with red-ruffed
   lemurs and black howler monkeys reducing their social interactions, as
   well as red-ruffed lemurs and lar gibbons decreasing their
   stress-related behaviors after they were exposed to the series of
   essential oils. We also found that red-ruffed lemurs displayed a
   significant increase in fecal glucocorticoids following exposure to
   essential oils. Our contradictory findings suggest that the effects of
   this series of essential oils may change depending on the
   species-specific social lives and olfactory repertoires of primates. In
   conclusion, we cannot recommend using these essential oils widely with
   zoo primates without additional evaluation.},

Abstract = {From the mid-June to mid-July 2020, there was a massive bloom of
   Creseise acicula nearby the waters of Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant Base
   (DNPP base). In order to find out the spatiotemporal dynamic
   characteristics of C. acicula and the main factors related to its
   outbreak and extinction, acoustic surveys and in-situ observations were
   performed. The results showed that the average abundance of C. acicula
   at the in-situ observation site fluctuated with the tidal rhythm.
   Furthermore, a horizontal migration pattern during ebb tide and a
   vertical subsidence trend of C. acicula was found. The outbreak of C.
   acicula bloom nearby the waters of DNPP base was the result of the joint
   action of water temperature, salinity and food availability etc. The
   extinction of C. acicula was mainly related to the adhesion of
   Licmophora, predation pressure from phytoplanktivorous fishes (such as
   Sardinella lemuru and Dussumieria elopsoides) and human intervention.},

Title = {The immune-modulating pregnancy-specific glycoproteins evolve rapidly
   and their presence correlates with hemochorial placentation in primates},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 18},
Abstract = {BackgroundPregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) genes belong to the
   carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family, within the immunoglobulin
   gene superfamily. In humans, 10 PSG genes encode closely related
   secreted glycoproteins. They are exclusively expressed in fetal
   syncytiotrophoblast cells and represent the most abundant fetal proteins
   in the maternal blood. In recent years, a role in modulation of the
   maternal immune system possibly to avoid rejection of the semiallogeneic
   fetus and to facilitate access of trophoblast cells to maternal
   resources via the blood system has been suggested. Alternatively, they
   could serve as soluble pathogen decoy receptors like other members of
   the CEA family. Despite their clearly different domain organization,
   similar functional properties have also been observed for murine and bat
   PSG. As these species share a hemochorial type of placentation and a
   seemingly convergent formation of PSG genes during evolution, we
   hypothesized that hemochorial placentae support the evolution of PSG
   gene families.ResultsTo strengthen this hypothesis, we have analyzed PSG
   genes in 57 primate species which exhibit hemochorial or
   epitheliochorial placentation. In nearly all analyzed apes some 10 PSG
   genes each could be retrieved from genomic databases, while 6 to 24 PSG
   genes were found in Old World monkey genomes. Surprisingly, only 1 to 7
   PSG genes could be identified in New World monkeys. Interestingly, no
   PSG genes were found in more distantly related primates with
   epitheliochorial placentae like lemurs and lorises. The exons encoding
   the putative receptor-binding domains exhibit strong selection for
   diversification in most primate PSG as revealed by rapid loss of
   orthologous relationship during evolution and high ratios of
   nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations.ConclusionThe distribution of
   trophoblast-specific PSGs in primates and their pattern of selection
   supports the hypothesis that PSG are still evolving to optimize
   fetal-maternal or putative pathogen interactions in mammals with
   intimate contact of fetal cells with the immune system of the mother
   like in hemochorial placentation.},

Title = {Children's Conversations Reveal In-Depth Learning at the Zoo},
Journal = {ANTHROZOOS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-32},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Learning in the zoo is a complex process with many influences affecting
   outcomes, which traditional methods of evaluation may not consider. This
   study used conversational content analysis, an innovative and under-used
   technique, to investigate children's learning in the zoo setting during
   an educational experience. The children's conversations were observed at
   Fota Wildlife Park and Dingle Aquarium in Ireland at three different
   animal exhibits (1) free-ranging ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) (2)
   Gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) and (3) Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus
   humboldti). Some groups of children (the treatment group) participated
   in a purposefully designed educational intervention, while others (the
   control group) experienced the standard curriculum only. Descriptive
   statistics indicated that all children engaged in diverse topics of
   conversation indicative of learning as they viewed animals. However,
   further analysis using a general linear model showed that participation
   in the treatment or control group (p < 0.001) and species viewed (p <
   0.001) affected the proportion of positive comments made by children.
   Groups that viewed free-ranging ring-tailed lemurs and Gentoo penguins
   made more types of positive comments than those that viewed Humboldt
   penguins, and children who experienced the educational intervention made
   more types of positive comments than children in the control group.
   Conversely, children in the control group made more types of negative
   comments (p < 0.001) than those in the treatment group. The results
   indicate that children do learn in the zoo setting; however, this was
   enhanced based on the type of educational activity the children
   experienced and the species they viewed. Overheard conversation offers a
   unique insight into the visitors' experience at the zoo, but further
   research is required to establish if conversation can reveal a
   propensity for pro-conservation behavior.},

   Monkeys Formed within a 15-Myr Time Span},
Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {In rod cells of many nocturnal mammals, heterochromatin localizes to the
   central region of the nucleus and serves as a lens to send light
   efficiently to the photoreceptor region. The genus Aotus (owl monkeys)
   is commonly considered to have undergone a shift from diurnal to
   nocturnal lifestyle. We recently demonstrated that rod cells of the
   Aotus species Aotus azarae possess a heterochromatin block at the center
   of its nucleus. The purpose of the present study was to estimate the
   time span in which the formation of the heterochromatin block tookplace.
   We performed three-dimensional hybridization analysis of the rod cell of
   another species, Aotus lemurinus. This analysis revealed the presence of
   a heterochromatin block that consisted of the same DNA components as
   those in A. azarae. These results indicate that the formation was
   complete at or before the separation of the two species. Based on the
   commonly accepted evolutionary history of New World monkeys and
   specifically of owl monkeys, the time span for the entire formation
   process was estimated to be 15 Myr at most.},

Title = {Myelination defects in the medial prefrontal cortex of Fkbp5 knockout
   mice},
Journal = {FASEB JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays a principal role in
   stress response regulation and has been implicated in the etiology of
   stress-related disorders. The HPA axis regulates the normal synthesis
   and release of glucocorticoids; dysregulation of the HPA axis causes
   abnormal responses to stress. FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5), a
   co-chaperone of heat shock protein 90 in the glucocorticoid receptor
   (GR) molecular complex, is a key GR sensitivity regulator. FKBP5 single
   nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with dysregulated HPA axis and
   increased risk of stress-related disorders, including posttraumatic
   stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. In this study, we profiled the
   microRNAs (miRNAs) in the medial prefrontal cortex of Fkbp5 knockout
   (Fkbp5(-/-)) mice and identified the target genes of differentially
   expressed miRNAs using sequence-based miRNA target prediction. Gene
   ontology analysis revealed that the differentially expressed miRNAs were
   involved in nervous system development, regulation of cell migration,
   and intracellular signal transduction. The validation of the expression
   of predicted target genes using quantitative polymerase chain reaction
   revealed that the expression of axon development-related genes,
   specifically actin-binding LIM protein 1 (Ablim1), lemur tyrosine kinase
   2 (Lmtk2), kinesin family member 5c (Kif5c), neurofascin (Nfasc), and
   ephrin type-A receptor 4 (Epha4), was significantly decreased, while
   that of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) was significantly
   increased in the brain of Fkbp5(-/-) mice. These results suggest that
   axonal development-related genes can serve as potential targets in
   future studies focused on understanding the pathophysiology of PTSD.},

   limited studies completed in 2015. Additional studies have identified
   this parasite in a variety of intermediate hosts, both native and
   non-native gastropod species, with new host species recorded. Many areas
   in Florida with higher A. cantonensis prevalence were those with a high

   human infections occur in Florida. Case reports in the state currently
   involve non-human primates and include a gibbon and orangutan in Miami.

Abstract = {Objectives The Willwood Formation of the southern Bighorn Basin, Wyoming
   is a fluvial rock sequence that spans approximately 3 million years of
   early Eocene time. It has yielded one the largest collections of fossil

   paleontological expeditions and the stratigraphic levels yielding the
   dentitions have been carefully recorded. Notharctine dentitions
   represent a rare opportunity to study morphological variation in a
   single anatomical system through time among closely related individuals.
   Materials and Methods Prior studies of Bighorn Basin notharctines
   through time produced measurements of hundreds of specimens but I report
   here results from measurement and comparison of the dentitions and
   dentaries of more than 3,000 specimens, all stratigraphically mapped.
   Results Variation in premolar and molar area and variation in dentary
   depth are apparent throughout the section. Specimens with relatively
   small teeth and dentaries are known from the older part of the section.
   In younger rocks, variation in tooth area among specimens increases.
   Variation in tooth area is continuous and overlaps extensively both
   within and between stratigraphic levels. Other dental variables examined
   by inspection change in a mosaic and continuous fashion through the
   section. These features include variation in the presence and number of
   paraconids on the lower fourth premolar (p4), the size and shape of the
   entoconid notch on the lower first and second molars, and the relative
   development of the pseudohypocone, mesostyle, and cingula on the upper
   molars.
   Discussion These broad patterns can be identified despite notharctine
   alpha taxonomy being in need of extensive revision and, importantly,
   simplification. Such revision is beyond the scope of this article but is
   essential if we are to develop a taxonomy that is both free of
   stratigraphic influence and useful for rapid, repeatable species
   assignment. Boundaries among the patterns of tokogenesis, anagenesis,
   and cladogenesis are blurred in this dense sample of extinct primates.
   While pattern of evolution, a population-level phenomenon, may be
   difficult to falsify in the fossil record, this notharctine sample
   suggests that in the rare instance such as this, when the fossil record
   is densely sampled, change through time is continuous and more
   consistent with gradual evolution.},

Abstract = {The glabrous skin around the nostrils in mammals is called a rhinarium
   or planum nasale. Rhinarium skin has multiple epidermal domes that are
   generally assumed to form a tactile surface. The rhinarium is innervated
   by a branch of the trigeminal nerve which is associated with stimuli
   such as touch, chemical irritants and temperature. In this study, our
   aim was to correlate variation in rhinarium skin sensory innervation
   with different feeding behaviors while also covering a broad systematic
   spectrum. Using histological and immunohistological methods, we studied
   skin morphology, nerve fiber density and nerve fiber distribution in the
   rhinarium epidermal domes of four species: cow, ring-tailed lemur, brown
   bear, and dog, that all exhibit different feeding behaviors. All species
   share similar traits in rhinarium skin morphology, but glands were only
   found in cow rhinarium skin. The most substantial differences were
   observed in the innervation pattern. Mechanosensory skin organs were
   found only in the ring-tailed lemur. Dog epidermal domes possess a
   pronounced central dermal papilla containing a nerve bundle in its top,
   close to the skin surface. The abundance of free epidermal nerve fibers
   in epidermal domes of all species, suggest that the rhinarium skin is a
   sensory surface, that can be used to detect fine touch, chemical
   irritants or temperature. In the species where the whole epidermal dome
   was examined, the intraepidermal nerve fiber density is higher in the
   central part of the domes. The nerve distribution and the central
   positioning of a single gland duct in cow and the dermal papilla top
   organ in dog indicates that each epidermal dome can be considered a
   functional unit. The observed differences in innervation hint at
   different sensory functions of rhinaria in mammals that may be
   correlated to feeding behavior.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the potential of low
   commercial value fish species in Lamongan Regency, East Java, Indonesia.
   The processed data included primary and secondary data. Data were
   processed using the LQ method and analyzed descriptively by way of
   compiling data into tables. The survey results showed that there are ten
   types of low commercial value fish in Lamongan Regency, East Java,
   Indonesia, namely Sardinella fimbriata (Tembang fish), Leiognathus
   bindus ( Peperek fish), Harpadon nehereus (Puso fish), Sardinella
   lemuru, (Lemuru fish), Saurida tumbil (Beloso fish), Gerres abbreviatus
   (Kapasan fish), Anodontostoma chacunda (Juwi fish), and Cynoglossus
   lingua (Lidah fish). The results of the LQ method showe that there are
   three types of fish that have the potential to be made of high economic
   value products, namely L. bindus (11.36), A. chacunda (2.35), and S.
   fimbriata (2.32). Fish Auction (TPI) that has the potential in terms of
   fish productivity to be developed is TPI Weru, Lamongan, East Java,
   Indonesia. The typology of fishermen in TPI Weru has less experience
   working as a fisherman than other TPI but the level of education is
   higher and the age of fishermen is younger so that it affects the
   productivity of fish catches.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES},

Abstract = {Palynological and organic geochemical analyses have been performed on an
   Early to Middle Devonian elastic marine sedimentary succession of the
   TCB X-1001 - Tacobo borehole, in the Foothills of the southern
   sub-Andean ranges of Bolivia. The studied subsurface section encompasses
   shallow marine deposits of the Ida, Huamampampa and Los Monos
   formations. Eighteen from the twenty-three cutting samples available
   were productive, yielding variable abundance, diversity and preservation
   of organic-walled phytoplankton and miospores, with an increasing trend
   of terrestrial palynomorphs transpiring towards the younger beds. The
   palynological assemblage of the Ida Formation contains Bimerga nuda,
   Cordobesia cf. C. uruguayensis, Duvernaysphaera angelae, and
   Dibolisporites echinaceus. The Huamampampa Formation includes
   Polyedryxium sp. cf. P. condensum, Umbellasphaeridium deflandrei and
   Acinosporites eumammillatus. Arkonites bilixus, Maranhites mosesii,
   Polyedryxium ``talus{''}, Stellinium comptun, Archaeozonotriletes
   variabilis, Chelinospora timanica, Convolutispora subtills,
   Cymbosporites cyathus, Dibolisporites farraginis, Geminospora lemurata,
   Grandispora permulta, Samarisporites eximius and Verrucosisporites
   premnus are among the most relevant taxa of the Los Monos Formation.
   Based on the organic-walled phytoplankton and the miospores of the
   studied section, the Ida, Huamampampa and Los Monos formations are
   assigned to the late Pragian - Emsian, Emsian and Eifelian?- middle
   Givetian, respectively. The palynomorph distribution, relative abundance
   and preservation throughout the studied samples support the
   palaeoenvironment interpretation based on sedimentology and sequence
   stratigraphy. RockEval pyrolysis, TOC, HI and Tmax data were analysed to
   determine type and quality of the kerogen and hydrocarbon potential of
   the stratigraphic units.},

Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-22},

Abstract = {The mammal family Tenrecidae (Afrotheria: Afrosoricida) is endemic to
   Madagascar. Here we present the conservation priorities for the 31
   species of tenrec that were assessed or reassessed in 2015-2016 for the
   IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Six species (19.4\%) were found to
   be threatened (4 Vulnerable, 2 Endangered) and one species was
   categorized as Data Deficient. The primary threat to tenrecs is habitat
   loss, mostly as a result of slash-and-burn agriculture, but some species
   are also threatened by hunting and incidental capture in fishing traps.
   In the longer term, climate change is expected to alter tenrec habitats
   and ranges. However, the lack of data for most tenrecs on population
   size, ecology and distribution, together with frequent changes in
   taxonomy (with many cryptic species being discovered based on genetic
   analyses) and the poorly understood impact of bushmeat hunting on spiny
   species (Tenrecinae), hinders conservation planning. Priority
   conservation actions are presented for Madagascar's tenrecs for the
   first time since 1990 and focus on conserving forest habitat (especially
   through improved management of protected areas) and filling essential
   knowledge gaps. Tenrec research, monitoring and conservation should be
   integrated into broader sustainable development objectives and
   programmes targeting higher profile species, such as lemurs, if we are
   to see an improvement in the conservation status of tenrecs in the near
   future.},

Abstract = {Infections with Entamoeba spp. are recognized as a cause of clinical
   disease in many species including humans and reptiles; however, cases in
   amphibians are under-reported. Investigation of a mortality event among
   a captive population of Cranwell's horned frogs Ceratophrys cranwelli at
   a production facility in Florida, USA, revealed that deaths were due to
   the newly described Entamoeba species CT1. Infection caused severe
   necroulcerative gastroenterocolitis with a predilection for the colon.
   To date, this Entamoeba species has only been described in invasive cane
   toads Rhinella marina in Australia. Retrospective screening of archived
   anuran cases from a zoological pathology service identified 8 cases from
   captive populations that had histological evidence of gastrointestinal
   entamoebiasis. Molecular characterization was positive in 3 cases. Two
   cases, 1 in a Puerto Rican crested toad Peltophryne lemur and 1 in an
   Amazon milk frog Trachycephalus resinifictrix, showed 100\% homology to
   E. ranarum and 1 case in a White's tree frog Litoria caerulea showed
   100\% homology to Entamoeba sp. CT1. This is the first report of novel
   Entamoeba sp. CT1 being associated with clinical disease in anurans
   within North America and also the first report of this Entamoeba species
   causing disease within managed collections as far back as 2003.},

Abstract = {A combined approach based on karyology and DNA taxonomy allowed us to
   characterize the taxonomic peculiarities in 10 Mesoamerican lizard
   species, belonging to six genera and five families, inhabiting two
   Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico: La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve,
   and Montes Azules Biosphere. The karyotypcs of four species,
   Phyllodactylus sp. 3 (P. tuhereulosus species group) (2n = 38), Holcosus
   Jestivus (Lichtenstein et von Martens, 1856) (2n = 50), Anolis lemurinus
   Cope, 1861 (2n = 40), and A. unifirmis Cope, 1885 (2n = 29-30) are
   described for the first time, the last one showing a particular
   X1X1X2X2/X1X2Y condition. In Aspidoscelis deppii (Wiegmann, 1834) (2n =
   50) and Anolis capito Peters, 1863 (2n = 42), we found a different
   karyotype from the ones previously reported for these species. Moreover,
   in A. capito, the cytogenetic observation is concurrent with a
   considerable genetic divergence (9\%) at the studied mtDNA marker
   (MT-ND2), which is indicative of a putative new cryptic species. The
   skink Scincella cherriei (Cope, 1893), showed high values of genetic
   divergence (5.2\% at 16S gene) between the specimens from Montes Azules
   and those from Costa Rica and Nicaragua, comparable to the values

Abstract = {The mouse is often criticized as a model for pregnancy research as
   gestation is short, with much of organ development completed
   postnatally. There are also differences in the structure and physiology
   of the placenta between mouse and human. This review considers eight
   alternative models that recently have been proposed and two established
   ones that seem underutilized. A promising newcomer among rodents is the
   spiny mouse, which has a longer gestation than the mouse with
   organogenesis complete at birth. The guinea pig is also recommended both
   because it has well-developed neonates and because there is a wealth of
   information on pregnancy and placentation hi the literature. Several
   smaller primates are considered. The mouse lemur has its advocates yet
   is less suited as a model for human pregnancy as its young are
   altricial, placentation very different from that of humans, and
   husbandry requirements not fully assessed. In contrast, the common
   marmoset, a New World monkey, has well-developed neonates and is kept at
   many primate centres. Marmoset placenta has some features that closely
   resemble human placentation, such as the interhaemal barrier, although
   it is uncertain if invasion of the uterine arteries occurs in this
   species. In conclusion, pregnancy research would benefit greatly from
   increased use of alternative models such as the spiny mouse and common
   marmoset.},

Abstract = {Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are parasites transmitted through
   contact with soil contaminated with their infective eggs/larvae. People
   are infected by exposure to human-specific species or animal species
   (zoonotic agents). Fecal samples containing eggs of Ascaris suum or
   Lemurostrongylus sp. were sprayed with spores of the soil saprophytic
   filamentous fungi Clonostachys rosea (CR) and Trichoderma atrobrunneum
   (TA). The antagonistic effect was assessed by estimating the viability
   of eggs and their developmental rate. Compared to the controls
   (unexposed to fungi), the viability of the eggs of A. suum was halved in
   CR and decreased by two thirds in TA, while the viability of the eggs of
   Lemurostrongylus sp. was reduced by one quarter and one third in CR and
   TA treatments, respectively. The Soil Contamination Index (SCI), defined
   as the viable eggs that attained the infective stage, reached the
   highest percentages for A. suum in the controls after four weeks (66\%),
   with 21\% in CL and 11\% in TA. For Lemurostrongylus sp., the values
   were 80\%, 49\%, and 41\% for control, CR and TA treatments,
   respectively. We concluded that spreading spores of C. rosea or T.
   atrobrunneum directly onto the feces of animal species represents a
   sustainable approach under a One Health context to potentially reduce
   the risk of zoonotic STHs in humans.},

Title = {Did Mammals Bring the First Mistletoes into the Treetops?},
Journal = {AMERICAN NATURALIST},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {196},
Number = {6},
Pages = {769-774},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The growth habit of mistletoes, the only woody, parasitic plants to
   infect host canopies, represents a key innovation. How this aerially
   parasitic habit originated is unknown; mistletoe macrofossils are
   relatively recent, from long after they adapted to canopy life and
   evolved showy, bird-pollinated flowers; sticky, bird-dispersed seeds;
   and woody haustoria diverting water and nutrients from host branches.
   Since the transition to aerial parasitism predates the origin of
   mistletoes' contemporary avian seed dispersers by 20-40 million years,
   this leaves unanswered the question of who the original mistletoe
   dispersers were. By integrating fully resolved phylogenies of mistletoes
   and aligning the timing of historic events, I identify two ancient
   mammals as likely candidates for planting Viscaceae and Loranthaceae in
   the canopy. Just as modern mouse lemurs and galagos disperse viscaceous
   mistletoe externally (grooming the sticky seeds from their fur),
   Cretaceous primates (e.g., Purgatorius) may have transported seeds of
   root-parasitic understory shrubs up into the canopy of Laurasian
   forests. In the Eocene, ancestors of today's mistletoe-dispersing
   marsupials, Dromiciops, likely fed on the nutritious fruit of
   root-parasitic loranthaceous shrubs, depositing the seeds atop western
   Gondwanan forest crowns. Once mistletoes colonized the canopy,
   subsequent evolution and diversification coincided with the rise of
   nectar- and fruit-dependent birds.},

Title = {Meat eating by nonhuman primates: A review and synthesis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {149},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Most nonhuman primates prey on vertebrates. Meat-eating, defined as
   ingestion of vertebrate tissue, occurs in 12 families, >= 39 genera, and
   >= 89 species. It is most common in capuchins (Cebus and Sapajus spp.),
   baboons (Papio spp.), bonobos (Pan paniscus), and chimpanzees (Pan
   troglodytes) and modestly common in blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis),
   callitrichids (Callithrix spp. and Saguinus spp.), and squirrel monkeys
   (Saimiri spp.). It is uncommon in other cercopithecines, rare in other
   haplorhines and in lemurs, and virtually absent in colobines. Birds are
   the prey class eaten by the most species (>= 53), followed by reptiles
   (>48), amphibians (>38), mammals (>35), and fish (>7). Major hypotheses
   for the importance of meat eating are that it is (1) mainly an energy
   source, especially (1a) when plant-source foods (PSFs) with high energy
   return rates are scarce (energy shortfall hypothesis); (2) mainly a
   protein source; and (3) mainly a source of micronutrients scarce in
   PSFs. Meat eating bouts sometimes provide substantial energy and
   protein, and some chimpanzees gain substantial protein from meat monthly
   or annually. However, meat typically accounts for only small proportions
   of feeding time and of total energy and protein intake, and quantitative
   data are inconsistent with the energy shortfall hypothesis. PSFs and/or
   invertebrates are presumably the main protein sources, even for
   chimpanzees. Support is strongest for the micronutrient hypothesis. Most
   chimpanzees eat far less meat than recorded for hunter-gatherers, but
   the highest chimpanzee estimates approach the lowest for African
   hunter-gatherers. In fundamental contrast to the human predatory
   pattern, other primates only eat vertebrates much smaller than they are,
   tool-assisted predation is rare except in some capuchins and
   chimpanzees, and tool use in carcass processing is virtually absent.
   However, harvesting of small prey deserves more attention with reference
   to the archaeological and ethnographic record. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Evolutionary stasis of the pseudoautosomal boundary in strepsirrhine
   primates},
Journal = {ELIFE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Sex chromosomes are typically comprised of a non-recombining region and
   a recombining pseudoautosomal region. Accurately quantifying the
   relative size of these regions is critical for sex-chromosome biology
   both from a functional and evolutionary perspective. The evolution of
   the pseudoautosomal boundary (PAB) is well documented in haplorrhines
   (apes and monkeys) but not in strepsirrhines (lemurs and lorises). Here,
   we studied the PAB of seven species representing the main strepsirrhine
   lineages by sequencing a male and a female genome in each species and
   using sex differences in coverage to identify the PAB. We found that
   during primate evolution, the PAB has remained unchanged in
   strepsirrhines whereas several recombination suppression events moved
   the PAB and shortened the pseudoautosomal region in haplorrhines.
   Strepsirrhines are well known to have much lower sexual dimorphism than
   haplorrhines. We suggest that mutations with antagonistic effects
   between males and females have driven recombination suppression and PAB
   evolution in haplorrhines},

Title = {Phylogenetic proximity influences humans' depictions of nonhuman

Number = {1-2, SI},

Abstract = {Portraits of humans favour the left cheek, with emotion thought to drive
   this posing asymmetry. In primates the emotion-dominant right hemisphere
   predominantly controls the left hemiface, rendering the left cheek
   anatomically more expressive than the right. As perceptions of nonhuman
   primates vary with genetic relatedness, depictions of nonhuman primates
   should theoretically be influenced by their phylogenetic proximity to
   humans. The present study thus examined whether humans depict nonhuman
   primates showing the left cheek, and whether depictions vary with
   evolutionary distance. Photographs of nonhuman primates were sourced
   from Instagram's ``Most recent{''} feed: great apes (\#chimpanzee,
   \#bonobo, \#gorilla, \#orangutan), lesser apes (\#gibbon), Old World
   monkeys (\#baboon, \#macaque, \#proboscismonkey), New World monkeys
   (\#spidermonkey, \#marmosetmonkey, \#capuchin), and prosimians (\#lemur,
   \#slowloris, \#tarsier). The first 500 single-subject images for each
   hashtag (except \#slowloris for which 318 images were available) were
   coded for pose orientation (left, right) and portrait type (head/torso,
   full body). As anticipated, there was a left cheek bias for great apes
   but no bias for more distantly related primates. These data thus suggest
   that depictions of nonhuman primates are implicitly influenced by
   phylogenetic proximity: the more closely related the primate, the more

Abstract = {In recent years, interest in understanding the effects of climate change
   on species and ecological systems has sharply increased. We quantify and
   contextualize the current state of knowledge about the effects of
   contemporary climate change on non-human primates, a taxon of great
   ecological and anthropological significance. Specifically, we report
   findings from a systematic literature search designed to assess the
   allocation of research effort on primates and climate change and
   consider how the current distribution of knowledge may be influencing
   our understanding of the topic. We reveal significant phylogenetic and
   geographic gaps in our knowledge, which is strongly biased towards
   lemurs, apes, and a relatively small subset of primate range countries.
   We show that few analyses investigate changes in primate foods relative
   to changes in primates themselves or their habitats, and observe that
   few longitudinal datasets are of sufficient duration to detect effects
   on the generational scale. We end by identifying areas of research
   inquiry that would advance our theoretical understanding of primate
   ecology, evolution, and adaptability, and meaningfully contribute to
   primate conservation.},

Title = {Home Range Size and Seasonal Variation in Habitat Use of Aye-Ayes
   (Daubentonia madagascariensis) in Torotorofotsy, Madagascar},

Volume = {91},

Abstract = {Madagascar's dramatic climatic fluctuations mean most lemurs adjust
   behaviors seasonally as resource availability fluctuates. Many lemurs
   will adopt one of two strategies, a resource maximizer or an area
   minimizer, when adjusting to seasonal shifts in resource availability.
   However, it is unknown if and how aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis)
   ranging behavior is influenced by seasonality. We explored whether
   habitat use changed seasonally. We followed two aye-ayes, an adult male
   and an adult female, in the undisturbed forest of Torotorofotsy,
   Madagascar, from April 2012 to December 2017. We used instantaneous
   focal-animal sampling to collect behavioral data every 5 min and GPS
   locations every 20 min. We used the minimum convex polygon (MCP) to
   determine overall home range, and the Brownian bridge movement model
   (BBMM) to estimate overall and seasonal home range of the female aye-aye
   from November 2014 to October 2017. We used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests
   to determine whether there were significant differences in home range
   sizes between seasons across years and to examine whether there were
   seasonal differences in height of invertebrate foraging, generalized
   linear models to assess seasonal differences in travel rates and nesting
   locations, and chi(2) tests to determine whether there were differences
   in forest strata use when foraging on invertebrates. The male's MCP home
   range was 2,586 ha, and the female's MCP home range was 765 ha. The
   seasonal BBMM for the female varied between 443.6 and 1,010.0 ha, though
   infant rearing appears to have influenced these values. There were no
   significant differences in seasonal home range, travel rates, nesting
   locations, or height of invertebrate feeding. However, canopy level
   invertebrate foraging occurred more often than understory or ground
   levels. It appears aye-ayes in this undisturbed forest were not
   influenced by seasonal shifts and had larger home ranges than any
   previously reported. These findings may indicate that aye-ayes in an
   undisturbed forest are resource maximizers, closely linked to
   invertebrate assemblages.},

Title = {Madagascan highlands: originally woodland and forest containing endemic
   grasses, not grazing-adapted grassland},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {287},
Number = {1937},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {Long considered a consequence of anthropogenic agropastoralism, the
   origin of Madagascar's central highland grassland is hotly disputed.
   Arguments that ancient endemic grasses formed grassland maintained by
   extinct grazers and fire have been persuasive. Consequent calls to
   repeal fire-suppression legislation, burn protected areas, and accept
   pastoralism as the `salvation' of endemic grasses mount, even as the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) declares 98\% of
   lemurs face extinction through fire-driven deforestation. By analysing
   grass data from contemporary studies, and assessing endemic vertebrate
   habitat and feeding guilds, we find that although the grassland
   potentially dates from the Miocene, it is inhospitable to endemic
   vertebrates and lacks obligate grazers. Endemic grasses are absent from
   dominant grassland assemblages, yet not from woodland and forest
   assemblages. There is compelling evidence that humans entered a highland
   dominated by woodland and forest, and burned it; by 1000 current era
   (CE), grass pollens eclipsed tree pollens, reminiscent of prevailing
   fire-induced transformation of African miombo woodland to grassland.
   Endemic grasses are survivors from vanished woody habitats where grassy
   patches were likely small and ephemeral, precluding adaptive radiation
   by endemic vertebrates to form grazing-guilds. Today forests, relic
   tapia woodland, and outcompeted endemic grasses progressively retreat in
   a burning grassland dominated by non-endemic, grazing-adapted grasses
   and cattle.},

Title = {Comparative ACE2 variation and primate COVID-19 risk},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has caused over a million human deaths and
   massive global disruption. The viral infection may also represent a
   threat to our closest living relatives, nonhuman primates. The contact
   surface of the host cell receptor, ACE2, displays amino acid residues
   that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these
   critical residues modulate infection susceptibility. Infection studies
   have shown that some primate species develop COVID-19-like symptoms;
   however, the susceptibility of most primates is unknown. Here, we show
   that all apes and African and Asian monkeys (catarrhines), exhibit the
   same set of twelve key amino acid residues as human ACE2. Monkeys in the
   Americas, and some tarsiers, lemurs and lorisoids, differ at critical
   contact residues, and protein modeling predicts that these differences
   should greatly reduce SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity. Other lemurs are
   predicted to be closer to catarrhines in their susceptibility. Our study
   suggests that apes and African and Asian monkeys, and some lemurs, are
   likely to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Urgent actions have been
   undertaken to limit the exposure of great apes to humans, and similar
   efforts may be necessary for many other primate species.},

Title = {Survival is reduced when endogenous period deviates from 24 h in a
   non-human primate, supporting the circadian resonance theory},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous attributes across living organisms and
   allow the coordination of internal biological functions with optimal
   phases of the environment, suggesting a significant adaptive advantage.
   The endogenous period called tau lies close to 24 h and is thought to be
   implicated in individuals' fitness: according to the circadian resonance
   theory, fitness is reduced when tau gets far from 24 h. In this study,
   we measured the endogenous period of 142 mouse lemurs (Microcebus
   murinus), and analyzed how it is related to their survival. We found
   different effects according to sex and season. No impact of tau on
   mortality was found in females. However, in males, the deviation of tau
   from 24 h substantially correlates with an increase in mortality,
   particularly during the inactive season (winter). These results,
   comparable to other observations in mice or drosophila, show that
   captive gray mouse lemurs enjoy better fitness when their circadian
   period closely matches the environmental periodicity. In addition to
   their deep implications in health and aging research, these results
   raise further ecological and evolutionary issues regarding the
   relationships between fitness and circadian clock.},

Abstract = {Cranial synchondroses are cartilaginous joints between basicranial bones
   or between basicranial bones and septal cartilage, and have been
   implicated as having a potential active role in determining craniofacial
   form. However, few studies have examined them histologically. Using
   histological and immunohistochemical methods, we examined all
   basicranial joints in serial sagittal sections of newborn heads from
   nine genera of primates (five anthropoids, four strepsirrhines). Each
   synchondrosis was examined for characteristics of active growth centers,
   including a zonal distribution of proliferating and hypertrophic
   chondrocytes, as well as corresponding changes in matrix characteristics
   (i.e., density and organization of Type II collagen). Results reveal
   three midline and three bilateral synchondroses possess attributes of
   active growth centers in all species (sphenooccipital, intrasphenoidal,
   presphenoseptal). One midline synchondrosis (ethmoseptal) and one
   bilateral synchondrosis (alibasisphenoidal synchondrosis {[}ABS]) are
   active growth centers in some but not all newborn primates. ABS is
   oriented more anteriorly in monkeys compared to lemurs and bushbabies.
   The sphenoethmoidal synchondrosis (SES) varies at birth: in monkeys, it
   is a suture-like joint (i.e., fibrous tissue between the two bones);
   however, in strepsirrhines, the jugum sphenoidale is ossified while the
   mesethmoid remains cartilaginous. No species possesses an SES that has
   the organization of a growth plate. Overall, our findings demonstrate
   that only four midline synchondroses have the potential to actively
   affect basicranial angularity and facial orientation during the
   perinatal timeframe, while the SES of anthropoids essentially
   transitions toward a ``suture-like{''} function, permitting passive
   growth postnatally. Loss of cartilaginous continuity at SES and
   reorientation of ABS distinguish monkeys from strepsirrhines.},

Abstract = {A prototype rover carrying an astrobiology payload was developed and
   deployed at analog field sites to mature generalized system
   architectures capable of searching for biosignatures in extreme terrain
   across the Solar System. Specifically, the four-legged Limbed Excursion
   Mechanical Utility Robot (LEMUR) 3 climbing robot with microspine
   grippers carried three instruments: A micro-X-ray fluorescence
   instrument based on the Mars 2020 mission's Planetary Instrument for
   X-ray Lithochemistry provided elemental chemistry; a deep-ultraviolet
   fluorescence instrument based in Mars 2020s Scanning Habitable
   Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals
   mapped organics in bacterial communities on opaque substrates; and a
   near-infrared acousto-optic tunable filter-based point spectrometer
   identified minerals and organics in the 1.6-3.6 mu m range. The rover
   also carried a light detection and ranging and a color camera for both
   science and navigation. Combined, this payload detects astrobiologically
   important classes of rock components (elements, minerals, and organics)
   in extreme terrain, which, as demonstrated in this work, can reveal a
   correlation between textural biosignatures and the organics or elements
   expected to preserve them in a habitable environment. Across >10 field
   tests, milestones were achieved in instrument operations, autonomous
   mobility in extreme terrain, and system integration that can inform
   future planetary science mission architectures. Contributions include
   (1) system-level demonstration of mock missions to the vertical
   exposures of Mars lava tube caves and Mars canyon walls, (2)
   demonstration of multi-instrument integration into a confocal
   arrangement with surface scanning capabilities, and (3) demonstration of
   automated focus stacking algorithms for improved signal-to-noise ratios
   and reduced operation time.},

Title = {Sensory Island Task (SIT): A New Behavioral Paradigm to Study Sensory
   Perception and Neural Processing in Freely Moving Animals},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {A central function of sensory systems is the gathering of information
   about dynamic interactions with the environment during self-motion. To
   determine whether modulation of a sensory cue was externally caused or a
   result of self-motion is fundamental to perceptual invariance and
   requires the continuous update of sensory processing about recent
   movements. This process is highly context-dependent and crucial for
   perceptual performances such as decision-making and sensory object
   formation. Yet despite its fundamental ecological role, voluntary
   self-motion is rarely incorporated in perceptual or neurophysiological
   investigations of sensory processing in animals. Here, we present the
   Sensory Island Task (SIT), a new freely moving search paradigm to study
   sensory processing and perception. In SIT, animals explore an open-field
   arena to find a sensory target relying solely on changes in the
   presented stimulus, which is controlled by closed-loop position tracking
   in real-time. Within a few sessions, animals are trained via positive
   reinforcement to search for a particular area in the arena ({''}target
   island{''}), which triggers the presentation of the target stimulus. The
   location of the target island is randomized across trials, making the
   modulated stimulus feature the only informative cue for task completion.
   Animals report detection of the target stimulus by remaining within the
   island for a defined time ({''}sit-time{''}). Multiple ``non-target{''}
   islands can be incorporated to test psychometric discrimination and
   identification performance. We exemplify the suitability of SIT for
   rodents (Mongolian gerbil,Meriones unguiculatus) and small primates
   (mouse lemur,Microcebus murinus) and for studying various sensory
   perceptual performances (auditory frequency discrimination, sound source
   localization, visual orientation discrimination). Furthermore, we show
   that pairing SIT with chronic electrophysiological recordings allows
   revealing neuronal signatures of sensory processing under ecologically
   relevant conditions during goal-oriented behavior. In conclusion, SIT
   represents a flexible and easily implementable behavioral paradigm for
   mammals that combines self-motion and natural exploratory behavior to
   study sensory sensitivity and decision-making and their underlying
   neuronal processing.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Volume = {10},

Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {Lemur tail kinase 1 (LMTK1), previously called Apoptosis-Associated
   Tyrosine Kinase (AATYK), remains an uncharacterized Ser/Thr protein
   kinase that is predominantly expressed in the brain. It is recently
   reported that LMTK1A, an isoform of LMTK1, binds to recycling endosomes
   through its palmitoylation and regulates endosomal trafficking by
   suppressing the activity of Rab11 small GTPase. In neurons, knockdown or
   knockout of LMTK1 results in longer axons, greater branching of
   dendrites and increased number of spines, suggesting that LMTK1 plays a
   role in neuronal circuit formation. However, its in vivo function
   remained to be investigated. Here, we examined the brain structures and
   behaviors of LMTK1 knockout (KO) mice. LMTK1 was expressed in most
   neurons throughout the brain. The overall brain structure appeared to be
   normal in LMTK1 KO mice, but the numbers of synapses were increased.
   LMTK1 KO mice had a slight impairment in memory formation and exhibited
   distinct psychiatric behaviors such as hyperactivity, impulsiveness and
   high motor coordination without social interaction deficits. Some of
   these abnormal behaviors represent core features of attention deficit
   hyperactive disorder (ADHD), suggesting the possible involvement of
   LMTK1 in the pathogenesis of ADHD.},

Abstract = {`Touch', and the return of the body to digital music-making in general,
   has taken on a central importance in electronic instrument design and
   theory in recent decades. `Touch' and lack thereof has been considered
   central to the challenge of a `disconnect' between musicians' bodily
   actions and digital instruments, and as a solution to it that
   instruments `of the future' can provide. But `touch' is not a universal
   quantity; it is a construction that varies widely in its application and
   invocation, across academic and commercial contexts of instrument
   design. This article examines the complex history of the contemporary
   concern with `touch', and its role in the framing and reception of
   instruments such as ROLI's Seaboard, JazzMutant's Lemur, Sensel's Morph
   and the Joue. With reference to writings on embodied cognition, the
   recent material turn in the humanities and to Mills and Sterne's concept
   of dismediation it seeks to historicise, interrogate, and denaturalise
   `touch' within instrument design and its surrounding discourse.},

Title = {Host Synthesized Carbohydrate Antigens on Viral Glycoproteins as
   ``Achilles' Heel{''} of Viruses Contributing to Anti-Viral Immune
   Protection},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The glycans on enveloped viruses are synthesized by host-cell machinery.
   Some of these glycans on zoonotic viruses of mammalian reservoirs are
   recognized by human natural antibodies that may protect against such
   viruses. These antibodies are produced mostly against carbohydrate
   antigens on gastrointestinal bacteria and fortuitously, they bind to
   carbohydrate antigens synthesized in other mammals, neutralize and
   destroy viruses presenting these antigens. Two such antibodies are:
   anti-Gal binding to alpha-gal epitopes synthesized in non-primate
   mammals, lemurs, and New World monkeys, and anti-N-glycolyl neuraminic
   acid (anti-Neu5Gc) binding to N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc)
   synthesized in apes, Old World monkeys, and many non-primate mammals.
   Anti-Gal appeared in Old World primates following accidental
   inactivation of the alpha 1,3galactosyltransferase gene 20-30 million
   years ago. Anti-Neu5Gc appeared in hominins following the inactivation
   of the cytidine-monophosphate-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid hydroxylase gene,
   which led to the loss of Neu5Gc alpha-gal epitopes, whereas few mutated
   offspring lacking alpha-gal epitopes and producing anti-Gal survived
   because anti-Gal destroyed viruses presenting alpha-gal epitopes,
   following replication in parental populations. Similarly, anti-Neu5Gc
   protected few mutated hominins lacking Neu5Gc in lethal virus epidemics
   that eliminated parental hominins synthesizing Neu5Gc. Since alpha-gal
   epitopes are presented on many zoonotic viruses it is suggested that
   vaccines elevating anti-Gal titers may be of protective significance in
   areas endemic for such zoonotic viruses. This protection would be during
   the non-primate mammal to human virus transmission, but not in
   subsequent human to human transmission where the virus presents human
   glycans. In addition, production of viral vaccines presenting multiple
   alpha-gal epitopes increases their immunogenicity because of effective
   anti-Gal-mediated targeting of vaccines to antigen presenting cells for
   extensive uptake of the vaccine by these cells.},

Title = {Genetic consequences of social structure in the golden-crowned sifaka},
Journal = {HEREDITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {125},
Number = {5},
Pages = {328-339},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Many species are structured in social groups (SGs) where individuals
   exhibit complex mating strategies. Yet, most population genetic studies
   ignore SGs either treating them as small random-mating units or focusing
   on a higher hierarchical level (the population). Empirical studies
   acknowledging SGs have found an overall excess of heterozygotes within
   SGs and usually invoke inbreeding avoidance strategies to explain this
   finding. However, there is a lack of null models against which
   ecological theories can be tested and inbreeding avoidance quantified.
   Here, we investigateinbreeding(deviation from random mating) in an
   endangered forest-dwelling pair-living lemur species (Propithecus
   tattersalli). In particular, we measure the inbreeding coefficient
   (F-IS) in empirical data at different scales: SGs, sampling sites and
   forest patches. We observe high excess of heterozygotes within SGs. The
   magnitude of this excess is highly dependent on the sampling scheme:
   while offspring are characterised by a high excess of heterozygotes
   (F-IS < 0), the reproductive pair does not show dramatic departures from
   Hardy-Weinberg expectations. Moreover, the heterozygosity excess
   disappears at larger geographic scales (sites and forests). We use a
   modelling framework that incorporates details of the sifaka mating
   system but does not include active inbreeding avoidance mechanisms. The
   simulated data show that, although apparent ``random mating{''} or
   eveninbreedingmay occur at the ``population{''} level, outbreeding is
   maintained within SGs. Altogether our results suggest that social
   structure leads to high levels of outbreeding without the need for
   active inbreeding avoidance mechanisms. Thus, demonstrating and
   measuring the existence of active inbreeding avoidance mechanisms may be
   more difficult than usually assumed.},

Abstract = {PIERCE1, p53 induced expression 1 in Rb null cells, is a novel p53
   target involved in the DNA damage response and cell cycle in mice. These
   facts prompted us to study the function of PIERCE1 with respect to
   p53-associated pathophysiology of cancer in humans. Unexpectedly,
   PIERCE1 did not respond to overexpression and activation of p53 in
   humans. In this study, we swapped p53 protein expression in human and
   mouse cells to find the clue of this difference between species. Human
   p53 expression in mouse cells upregulatedPIERCE1expression, suggesting
   that p53-responsive elements on thePIERCE1promoter are crucial, but not
   the p53 protein itself. Indeed,in silicoanalyses ofPIERCE1promoters
   revealed that p53-responsive elements identified in mice are not
   conserved in humans. Consistently, chromatin
   immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses confirmed p53
   enrichment against thePIERCE1promoter region in mice, not in human
   cells. To complement the p53 study in mice, further promoter analyses
   suggested that the humanPIERCE1promoter is more similar to guinea pigs,
   lemurs, and dogs than to rodents. Taken together, our results confirm
   the differential responsiveness ofPIERCE1expression to p53 due to
   species differences inPIERCE1promoters. The results also show partial
   dissimilarity after p53 induction between mice and humans.},

Abstract = {Biliverdin reductase B (BLVRB) family members are general flavin
   reductases critical in maintaining cellular redox with recent findings
   revealing that BLVRB alone can dictate cellular fate. However, as
   opposed to most enzymes, the BLVRB family remains enigmatic with an
   evolutionarily changing active site and unknown structural and
   functional consequences. Here, we applied a multi-faceted approach that
   combines X-ray crystallography, NMR and kinetics methods to elucidate
   the structural and functional basis of the evolutionarily changing BLVRB
   active site. Using a panel of three BLVRB isoforms (human, lemur and
   hyrax) and multiple human BLVRB mutants, our studies reveal a novel
   evolutionary mechanism where coenzyme `clamps' formed by arginine side
   chains at two co-evolving positions within the active site serve to slow
   coenzyme release (Positions 14 and 78). We find that coenzyme release is
   further slowed by the weaker binding substrate, resulting in relatively
   slow turnover numbers. However, different BLVRB active sites imposed by
   either evolution or mutagenesis exhibit a surprising inverse
   relationship between coenzyme release and substrate turnover that is
   independent of the faster chemical step of hydride transfer also
   measured here. Collectively, our studies have elucidated the role of the
   evolutionarily changing BLVRB active site that serves to modulate
   coenzyme release and has revealed that coenzyme release is coupled to
   substrate turnover.},

Title = {Mechanics of heel-strike plantigrady in African apes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {145},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The initiation of a walking step with a heel strike is a defining
   characteristic of humans and great apes but is rarely found in other
   mammals. Despite the considerable importance of heel strike to an
   understanding of human locomotor evolution, no one has explicitly tested
   the fundamental mechanical question of why great apes use a heel strike.
   In this report, we test two hypotheses (1) that heel strike is a
   function of hip protraction and/or knee extension and (2) that
   short-legged apes with a midfoot that dorsiflexes at heel lift and long
   digits for whom digitigrady is not an option use heel-strike
   plantigrady. This strategy increases hip translation while potentially
   moderating the cost of redirecting the center of mass ('collisional
   costs') during stance via rollover along the full foot from the heel to
   toes. We quantified hind limb kinematics and relative hip translation in
   ten species of primates, including lemurs, terrestrial and arboreal
   monkeys, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Chimpanzees and gorillas walked with
   relatively extended knees but only with moderately protracted hips or
   hind limbs, partially rejecting the first hypothesis. Nonetheless,
   chimpanzees attained relative hip translations comparable with those of
   digitigrade primates. Heel-strike plantigrady may be a natural result of
   a need for increased hip translations when forelimbs are relatively long
   and digitigrady is morphologically restricted. In addition, foot
   rollover from the heel to toe in large, short-legged apes may reduce
   energetic costs of redirecting the center of mass at the step-to-step
   transition as it appears to do in humans. Heel strike appears to have
   been an important mechanism for increasing hip translation, and possibly
   reducing energetic costs, in early hominins and was fundamental to the
   evolution of the modern human foot and human bipedalism. (C) 2020

Abstract = {Lemur kinase 1 (LMTK1) is a membrane-bound Ser/Thr kinase that is
   expressed in neurons. There are two splicing variants of LMTK1 with
   different membrane binding modes, viz., cytosolic LMTK1A that binds to
   membranes through palmitoylation at the N-terminal cysteines and LMTK1B,
   an integral membrane protein with transmembrane sequences. We recently
   reported that LMTK1A regulates axon outgrowth and spine formation in
   neurons. However, data about LMTK1B are scarce. We analysed the
   expression and cellular localization of LMTK1B along with its role in
   axon and spine formation. We found that both LMTK1B and LMTK1A were
   expressed equally in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of the mouse
   brain. Similar to LMTK1A, the wild type of LMTK1B was localized to
   Rab11-positive pericentrosomal compartment. The kinase negative (kn)
   mutant of LMTK1B was found to be associated with an increase in the
   tubular form of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which was not the case with
   LMTK1A kn. Furthermore, unlike LMTK1A kn, LMTK1B kn did not stimulate
   the axon outgrowth and spine formation. These results suggest that while
   LMTK1A and LMTK1B share a common function in recycling endosomal
   trafficking at the pericentrosomal compartment, LMTK1B has an additional
   unique function in vesicle transport in the ER region.},

Title = {LMTK1, a Novel Modulator of Endosomal Trafficking in Neurons},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Neurons extend long processes known as axons and dendrites, through
   which they communicate with each other. The neuronal circuits formed by
   the axons and dendrites are the structural basis of higher brain
   functions. The formation and maintenance of these processes are
   essential for physiological brain activities. Membrane components, both
   lipids, and proteins, that are required for process formation are
   supplied by vesicle transport. Intracellular membrane trafficking is
   regulated by a family of Rab small GTPases. A group of Rabs regulating
   endosomal trafficking has been studied mainly in nonpolarized culture
   cell lines, and little is known about their regulation in polarized
   neurons with long processes. As shown in our recent study, lemur tail
   (former tyrosine) kinase 1 (LMTK1), an as yet uncharacterized Ser/Thr
   kinase associated with Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, modulates the
   formation of axons, dendrites, and spines in cultured primary neurons.
   LMTK1 knockdown or knockout (KO) or the expression of a kinase-negative
   mutant stimulates the transport of endosomal vesicles in neurons,
   leading to the overgrowth of axons, dendrites, and spines. More
   recently, we found that LMTK1 regulates TBC1D9B Rab11 GAP and proposed
   the Cdk5/p35-LMTK1-TBC1D9B-Rab11 pathway as a signaling cascade that
   regulates endosomal trafficking. Here, we summarize the biochemical,
   cell biological, and physiological properties of LMTK1.},

Abstract = {Stylistically unique black rock drawings have been discovered in
   Andriamamelo Cave in western Madagascar. Several image groupings
   comprise naturalistic scenes with anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and
   therianthropic figures. These complex images are not similar to the
   polychrome painted symbols previously described from the Isalo region of
   SW Madagascar. Eight instances were noted where images and themes
   suggest Ptolemaic Egyptian mythological characters and symbols, some
   possibly of stellar constellations. One type of M-shaped figure occurred
   16 times throughout the entire design field. We have not found this
   figure in other rock art around the Indian Ocean, except a rare
   occurrence in Borneo, believed to have been created about 2000 years
   ago. It also matches one distinctive character found in the Amharic
   alphabet of Ethiopia. One set of eight curvilinears resemble Arabic
   characters or indigenousSorabe.Extant animals were tentatively
   identified, and also three of the extinct megafauna may be pictured
   (elephant bird, tortoise, and sloth lemur). The latter appears in an
   inferred hunting scene, with a hunter pointing a weapon, the giant lemur
   upside down, and two dogs. Images suggest connections between
   traditional Malagasy symbology and the disparate worlds of the island's
   ancient influences, both from NE Africa and Borneo. Milligram-sized
   samples of the black pigment were collected from an image for AMS(14)C
   dating, but they contained insufficient carbon in aggregate.},

Title = {Molecular detection of Rickettsia spp., Borrelia spp., Bartonella spp.

   southwest Madagascar},
Journal = {ACTA TROPICA},

Abstract = {Little is known about the presence of vector-borne bacteria in southwest
   Madagascar. Anthropogenic alteration of natural habitats represents an
   important driver for the emergence of new diseases. Especially the
   involvement of livestock and the involuntary maintaining of invasive
   synanthropic animals (particularly rats) facilitate disease transmission
   from wildlife to humans and associated animals and vice versa. The
   dissemination or acquisition of ectoparasites is most likely in regions
   where human/wildlife contact is increasing. Little is known about the
   presence of vector-borne bacteria in southwest Madagascar. In 2016 and
   2017, ectoparasites were collected from various introduced (cattle and
   goats, cats, dogs and chicken, rats and mice) and native animal species
   (mouse lemurs {[}Microcebus griseorufus], Grandidier's mongooses
   {[}Galidictis grandidieri], bastard big-footed mice {[}Macrotarsomys
   bastardi], greater hedgehog tenrecs {[}Setifer setosus] and lesser
   hedgehog tenrecs {[}Echinops telfairi]) in the northern portion of
   Tsimanampetsotsa National Park and the adjacent littoral region.
   Thirteen species of blood-feeding ectoparasites (235 individuals of
   ticks {[}5 species], 414 lice {[}4 spp.] and 389 fleas {[}4 spp.]) were
   investigated for the presence and identity of rickettsiae, borreliae,
   bartonellae and Yersinia pestis using PCR techniques. Rickettsia spp.
   were detected in every single ectoparasite species (Amblyomma
   variegatum, A. chabaudi, Rhipicephalus microplus, Haemaphysalis simplex,
   Argas echinops, Ctenocephalides felis, Echidnophaga gallinacea, Pulex
   irritans, Xenopsylla cheopis, Haematopinus quadripertusus, Linognathus
   africanus, L. vituli, Lemurpediculus verruculosus). Lice and ticks were
   found harboring rickettsiae identified as Rickettsia africae, while
   Rickettsia felis-like bacteria were associated with fleas. Borrelia spp.
   were detected in 5\% of H. simplex and 1\% of R. microplus ticks.
   Bartonella spp. were detected in 40\% of H. quadripertusus pools and in
   5\% of L. verruculosus pools. Y. pestis was detected in X. cheopis and
   E. gallinacea fleas collected from a rat. This study presents the
   detection of a broad spectrum of vector-borne bacteria including
   potential pathogens, and an unexpected finding of Y. pestis far off the
   known plague foci in Madagascar.},

Abstract = {The Suoidea from Gracanica in the Bugojno Basin (Bosnia and Herzegovina)

   Suidae). These belong to three anagenetic lineages, known from Western
   Europe to Anatolia. The fossils from Gracanica and these lineages are
   described in detail. Biostratigraphic correlations in an area extending
   from Western Europe to Anatolia are proposed on the basis of these
   lineages. These correlations are consistent with known independent age
   estimates of the large mammal localities in the different areas. Because
   the Suoidea from Gracanica belong to groups which have suffered from
   recent taxonomic inflation, their systematics has been discussed for a
   correct classification.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Relatively large new samples of the rare plesiadapid mammal Chiromyoides
   are reported from upper Paleocene rocks exposed along the eastern flank
   of the Rock Springs Uplift and the adjacent Washakie Basin in
   southwestern Wyoming. These specimens form the basis for the new upper
   Tiffanian species Chiromyoides kesiwah and enhance our knowledge of the
   anatomy of early Clarkforkian C. gingerichi. Multiple previously
   unreported or unrecognized specimens of Chiromyoides are also described
   from upper Paleocene faunas in Texas, Colorado, and Wyoming, enabling a
   new phylogenetic analysis of all known species of Chiromyoides and
   selected other plesiadapids and outgroup taxa. The phylogeny of
   Chiromyoides appears to have been more complicated than previously
   described, partly because the genus was more speciose than previously
   appreciated. European C. campanicus and C. mauberti are sister taxa that
   are deeply nested within an otherwise North American radiation of
   Chiromyoides, suggesting that Chiromyoides originated in North America
   before dispersing to Europe in the latter part of the Tiffanian. Most of
   the derived anatomical features that distinguish Chiromyoides from
   closely related plesiadapids indicate that it was yet another occupant
   of the lucrative `mammalian woodpecker' niche, alongside the extant
   Malagasy lemur Daubentonia, the extant phalangeroid marsupial
   Dactylopsila, early Cenozoic placental Apatemyidae, and possibly the
   middle Cenozoic metatherian Yalkaparidon.},

Title = {Molecular characterization of Trichuris spp. from captive animals based
   on mitochondrial markers},
Journal = {PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {75},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Monoxenous parasites may easily infect animals in captivity, and
   nematodes belonging to the genus Trichuris are commonly reported in
   zoological gardens worldwide. Infections in captive animals should be
   accurately monitored and the characterization of pathogens is highly
   advisable, as a tool to infer possible routes of intra- and
   interspecific transmission pathways and to assess the related zoonotic
   potential. Whipworms are usually identified on the basis of few
   morphological features of adults males and eggs and by an
   host-affiliation criterion. Given the strong morphological convergence
   of adaptive traits and the possible occurrence of hybridization and/or
   cross-infections events, the use of molecular methods is of great
   utility.
   Here, we analysed two partial mitochondrial loci, the cytochrome c
   oxidase I and the cytochrome b regions, in Trichuris spp. infecting four
   animal species hosted in the Bioparco Zoological Garden of Rome. Results
   from molecular systematics, compared to previous data, suggested that
   the five Trichuris taxa recovered were well separated, showing a
   significant degree of host affiliation (herbivorous, primates/swine and
   rodents/canids). The screw horn antelopes and the camels were infected
   with two variants of Trichuris ovis; Trichuris sp. similar to those
   observed in rodents from South America was infecting the Patagonian
   maras. Moreover, Trichuris from the ring-tailed lemur showed a great
   similarity to Trichuris infecting the Japanese macaque previously
   analysed from the same zoological garden, and clustering together with
   Trichuris trichiura, posing a potential zoonotic threat for visitors and
   workers.},

Abstract = {Intergroup encounters are common in nonhuman primates and can vary from
   affiliative to aggressive. We extracted data from the literature to test
   five different hypotheses: 1) where there are group size differences
   between opposing groups, whether the larger group is more likely to win
   an intergroup encounter than the smaller group; 2) whether the
   likelihood of a group engaging in aggressive intergroup encounters
   increases with group size; and 3-5) whether dominant, older individuals,
   and/or males are more likely to participate aggressively in intergroup
   encounters than subordinate, younger individuals and/or females. Our
   data set comprised 52 studies on 31 primate species (3 lemur species, 5
   New World monkeys, 19 Old World monkeys, and 4 apes). We found that the
   larger group is more likely to win an encounter against a smaller group
   than vice versa. We found no significant relationship between group size
   and propensity to be aggressive during intergroup encounters. We found
   weak/no support for the effect of age, dominance rank, and sex on the
   frequency of aggression displayed toward outgroup individuals during
   intergroup encounters. Species- and population-specific differences in
   inter- and intragroup competition and in the degree of the unequal
   distribution of resources across group members may explain why age,
   dominance rank, and sex are not strong predictors of aggression during
   intergroup encounters.},

Title = {Obstacles and opportunities for female leadership in mammalian

Journal = {LEADERSHIP QUARTERLY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2, SI},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Women remain universally underrepresented in the top leadership
   positions. A comparative evolutionary framework may offer new insights
   into the value of and potential barriers to female leadership. Here we
   define leaders as individuals who impose a disproportional influence on
   the collective behaviors of group members. We reviewed data for 76
   social species of non-human mammals to reveal the circumstances favoring
   female leadership and species exhibiting female-biased leadership in two
   or more contexts (e.g., collective movements, group foraging, conflict
   resolution within groups, or conflicts between groups). Although rare
   across the lineage, female-biased leadership is pervasive in killer
   whales, lions, spotted hyenas, bonobos, lemurs, and elephants; leaders
   emerge without coercion and followers benefit from the social support
   and/or ecological knowledge from elder females. Our synthesis elucidates
   barriers to female leadership, but also reveals that traditional
   operationalizations of leadership are themselves male-biased. We
   therefore propose a new agenda for assessing the overlooked ways that
   females exert influence in groups.},

Title = {Mandibular symphyseal fusion in fossil primates: Insights from
   correlated patterns of jaw shape and masticatory function in living
   primates},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {173},
Number = {2},
Pages = {322-336},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objectives Variation in primate masticatory form and function has been
   extensively researched through both morphological and experimental
   studies. As a result, symphyseal fusion in different primate clades has
   been linked to either the recruitment of vertically directed
   balancing-side muscle force, the timing and recruitment of transversely
   directed forces, or both. This study investigates the relationship
   between jaw muscle activity patterns and morphology in extant primates
   to make inferences about masticatory function in extinct primates, with
   implications for understanding the evolution of symphyseal fusion.
   Materials and methods Three-dimensional mandibular landmark data were
   collected for 31 extant primates and nine fossil anthropoids and
   subfossil lemur species. Published electromyography (EMG) data were
   available for nine of the extant primate species. Partial least squares
   analysis and phylogenetic partial least squares analysis were used to
   identify relationships between EMG and jaw shape data and evaluate
   variation in jaw morphology. Results Primates with partial and complete
   symphyseal fusion exhibit shape-function patterns associated with the
   wishboning motor pattern and loading regime, in contrast to
   shape-function patterns of primates with unfused jaws. All fossil
   primates examined (exceptApidium) exhibit jaw morphologies suggestive of
   the wishboning motor pattern demonstrated in living anthropoids and
   indriids. Discussion Partial fusion inCatopithecus, similar to indriids
   and some subfossil lemurs, may be sufficient to resist, or transfer,
   some amounts of transversely directed balancing-side muscle force at the
   symphysis, representing a transition to greater reliance on transverse
   jaw movement during mastication. Furthermore, possible functional
   convergences in physiological patterns during chewing
   (i.e.,Archaeolemur) are identified.},

Title = {Pliocene bats (Chiroptera) from Kanapoi, Turkana Basin, Kenya},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {140},
Number = {SI},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Fossil bats from the Pliocene of Africa are extremely rare, especially
   in East Africa where meager records have been reported only from two
   localities in the Omo River Basin Shungura Formation and from a
   scattering of localities in the Afar Depression, both in Ethiopia. Here
   we report on a diverse assemblage of bats from Kanapoi in the Turkana
   Basin that date to approximately 4.19 million years ago. The Kanapoi bat
   community consists of four different species of fruit bats including a
   new genus and two new species as well as five species of echolocating
   bats, the most common of which are two new species of the molossid genus
   Mops. Additionally, among the echolocating bats, a new species of the
   emballonurid Saccolaimus is documented at Kanapoi along with an
   additional Saccolaimus species and a potentially new species of the
   nycterid Nycteris. Compared to other East African Pliocene bat
   assemblages, the Kanapoi bat community is unique in preserving molossids
   and curiously lacks any evidence of cave dwelling bats like rhinolophids
   or hipposiderids, which are both common at other East African sites. The
   bats making up the Kanapoi community all typically roost in trees, with
   some preferring deeper forests and larger trees (molossids), while the
   others (pteropodids, nycterids and emballonurids) roost in trees near
   open areas. Living fruit bats that are related to Kanapoi species
   typically forage for fruits along the margins of forests and in open
   savannah. The echolocating forms from Kanapoi consist of groups that
   aerially hawk for insects in open areas between patches of forest and
   along water courses. The habitats preferred by living relatives of the
   Kanapoi bats are in agreement with those constructed for Kanapoi based
   on other lines of evidence. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Madagascar does not have native wild felid species; however, distinct
   populations of free-ranging ``forest cats{''} of unknown species are
   known throughout the island, including at Ankarafantsika National Park,
   Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Makira Natural Park and the Masoala
   peninsula. Malagasy ``forest cats{''} are commonly considered invasive
   lemur predators and competitors with endemic carnivores as well as a
   nuisance exotic species that kill poultry. These cats may be descendants
   of African wildcats, European wildcats and/or domestic cats; however, no
   research on their genetic origin has been published. To determine their
   taxonomic status, genetic data from short tandem repeat markers was
   assessed for three wild-caught ``forest cats{''} from the Beza Mahafaly
   Special Reserve (BMSR) and 27 ``forest cats{''} from Ankarafantsika
   National Park. Bayesian analyses comparing the Malagasy ``forest
   cats{''} to approximately 1900 domestic and wildcat sub-species suggest
   the Malagasy cats are descendents of domestic cats from the Arabian Sea
   region, including the islands of Lamu and Pate, Dubai, Kuwait and Oman.
   Additional genetic influences may descend from India and Pakistan.
   Combined with cultural and historical information, these data suggest
   that these felid populations are likely descendents from cats that
   immigrated to the island on trade ships, particularly along early Arab
   trade routes.},

Title = {Unusual sequence characteristics of human chromosome 19 are conserved
   across 11 nonhuman primates},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {Background Human chromosome 19 has many unique characteristics including
   gene density more than double the genome-wide average and 20 large
   tandemly clustered gene families. It also has the highest GC content of
   any chromosome, especially outside gene clusters. The high GC content
   and concomitant high content of hypermutable CpG sites raises the
   possibility chromosome 19 exhibits higher levels of nucleotide diversity
   both within and between species, and may possess greater variation in
   DNA methylation that regulates gene expression. Results We examined GC
   and CpG content of chromosome 19 orthologs across representatives of the
   primate order. In all 12 primate species with suitable genome
   assemblies, chromosome 19 orthologs have the highest GC content of any
   chromosome. CpG dinucleotides and CpG islands are also more prevalent in
   chromosome 19 orthologs than other chromosomes. GC and CpG content are
   generally higher outside the gene clusters. Intra-species variation
   based on SNPs in human common dbSNP, rhesus, crab eating macaque, baboon
   and marmoset datasets is most prevalent on chromosome 19 and its
   orthologs. Inter-species comparisons based on phyloP conservation show
   accelerated nucleotide evolution for chromosome 19 promoter flanking and
   enhancer regions. These same regulatory regions show the highest CpG
   density of any chromosome suggesting they possess considerable methylome
   regulatory potential. Conclusions The pattern of high GC and CpG content
   in chromosome 19 orthologs, particularly outside gene clusters, is
   present from human to mouse lemur representing 74 million years of
   primate evolution. Much CpG variation exists both within and between
   primate species with a portion of this variation occurring in regulatory
   regions.},

Abstract = {We here present the first detailed study of the specimen KNM-RU 18340
   from Rusinga Island (Kenya), the only known complete early Miocene
   chameleon skull, using micro-CT. This specimen represents one of the
   oldest chameleon fossils ever recovered. For the first time, the skull
   bone internal surfaces, their sutures, and elements contained inside the
   rocky matrix are observed. Our morphological comparisons and
   phylogenetic analyses place this specimen confidently in the genus
   Calumma and a new species, Calumma benovskyi sp. nov., is erected for
   it. Since all species of this genus are endemic to Madagascar, this
   fossil uniquely demonstrates the existence of Calumma on continental
   Africa in the past. Our results challenge the long-held view that
   chameleons originated on Madagascar and dispersed over water to Africa,
   and provide a strong evidence of an African origin for some Malagasy
   lineages. The Oligoceneearly Miocene dispersal to Madagascar, using
   oceanic currents that favoured eastward dispersal at that time, is a
   highly supported scenario matching the suggested dispersal of lemurs to
   this island. This is consistent with a previously suggested hypothesis
   based on molecular data.},

Title = {Using Hierarchical Likelihood Towards Support Vector Machine: Theory and
   Its Application},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {194795-194807},
Abstract = {The H-likelihood method proposed by Lee and Nelder (1996) is extensively
   used in a wide range of data. In terms of direction, repetitive measured
   data within classification can be examined employing hierarchical
   generalized linear models (HGLMs). Whether we are concerned in multiple
   endpoints which are correlated, instead Multivariate Double Hierarchical
   Generalized Linear Models (DHGLM) can be taken into consideration. This
   article addresses the implementation of this principle to vector
   selection and support machines. Based on the analysis with the fish
   morphology class Sardinella lemuru (Bali sardinella) and setting the
   best epsilon 0.7 cost 4 parameter reaching best performance: 0.2327401.
   Predictive value of fish sex was calculated 0.997319 and Region under
   the curve: 0.8967. At the same time, we extend the large-scale case
   studies for stress testing of the SVM method by using three datasets
   from UCI machine learning repository including the bank marketing
   dataset, the car evaluation database and human activity recognition
   using smartphones dataset. In a nutshell by employing SVM-DHGLM
   increased the accuracy, precision, recall, for feature selection and
   classification. Long story short, the H-likelihood provides an excellent
   and usable structure for statistical inference of the unobservable
   general deterministic model, while preserving the advantages of the
   original probability structure for fixed parameters. We presume that
   more new groups of models will be created and that the H-likelihood will
   be commonly used for their inferences and the application in big data
   and machine learning.},

Abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the effect of flushing with different fatty
   acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) from
   lemuru fish oil in the rations of local sheep on folliculogenesis.
   Sixteen ewes divided into 4 groups fed rations T0=basal ration;
   T1=flushing rations containing linoleic without enriched EPA and DHA;
   T2=flushing rations containing linoleic enriched with EPA and DHA,
   T3=flushing rations containing linoleic enriched with EPA and DHA with
   two times from maintenance requirement. Ratio forages and concentrates
   in the ration were 30\%:70\%. The parameter observed were body weight
   gain (BWG), body condition score (BCS), nutrient consumption, corpus
   luteum, diameter and amount of follicle, blood cholesterol, and blood
   glucose. The data obtained are analyzed by analysis of variance follow
   by Duncan Test. The results showed that the treatments did not
   significant effect to the dry matter consumption, protein, fiber, and
   total digestible nutrient, but significantly effect to fat consumptions
   (P<0.05). Flushing treatment for three weeks increased BCS from 0.75 to
   0.87. There were significant effect to large follicles, the diameters of
   large follicle and corpus luteum. Plasma glucose and cholesterol
   concentrations during the flushing period have significantly different
   (P<0.05) among all treatments.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a three-row opposed gripping mechanism with radial
   configuration for wall-climbing robots inspired by the structure of the
   gripper of LEMUR IIB. The mechanism builds upon a kind of microspines
   for climbing robots. This work utilizes an opposed spoke configuration
   with 3 rows of 31 microspines on each linkage array, splayed around a
   central bracket. A single motor drives the 3 linkage arrays by a set of
   gears to achieve attachment and detachment procedures, and the
   trajectory of each linkage array tip makes the miniature spines easy to
   penetrate in and pull off the surfaces. The mechanism designed as a foot
   of climbing robots can vertically resist at least I kg of load on rough
   surface. The findings provide a foundation for constructing a system for
   a rough-wall-climbing robot.},

Abstract = {The comprehensive analysis of geological, geophysical, and geochemical
   data makes it possible to obtain the most complete picture of the
   geological structure of the central part of the Ninety East Ridge (NER),
   the Osborn Plateau, and the adjacent part of the Central Basin. This
   region has been established to be a complex tectonic structure. In
   respect of the revealed structural features of the major near-NS faults
   of Indrani, Indira, and Lanka, they are not transform faults. Based on
   the generalization of all available data on the northern and southern
   parts of the NER, supplemented by the studies of the NER's central part,
   it is found out that the NER was constructed on the continental crust of
   an ancient continent, likely Lemuria. According to a new formation
   model, the NER is a relict fragment of this continent, preserved in the
   form of a block or an escarp, as an extended horst structure. This paper
   involves the primary data obtained by different Russian scientific and
   production organizations in the course of expeditions in the Central
   Basin during the 1980-1990s, as well as other data, including those
   obtained from foreign sources.},

   complement of Saccolaimus can be explained by one Robertsonian fusion,
   one type-b, and one type-c whole arm reciprocal translocation. The 2n =
   24 karyotype of Emballonura is highly derived by splitting of 11 of the
   25 chiropteran evolutionarily conserved units resulting in a total
   number of 36 segments. In contrast to the presence of several

Journal = {ANIMAL COGNITION},

Volume = {23},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {How much nonhuman animals understand about seeing has been the focus of
   comparative cognition research for decades. Many social primates (and
   other species) are sensitive to cues about what others can and cannot
   see. Whether this sensitivity evolved in primates through shared descent
   or convergent evolution remains unclear. The current study tested
   gibbons-the apes that are least studied yet most distantly related to
   humans and one of the less social primates-in two food-competition
   tasks. Specifically, we presented eastern hoolock gibbons, Hoolock
   leuconedys, and silvery gibbons, Hylobates moloch, with a choice between
   a contested piece of food visible to both themselves and a human
   competitor and an uncontested piece visible only to themselves. Subjects
   successfully stole the uncontested food when the competitor turned away
   his body (N = 10, experiment 1) and his head (N = 9, experiment 2).
   However, when the head of the experimenter was oriented towards the
   contested piece of food, whether the competitor opened or closed his
   eyes made no difference. Subjects' sensitivity to body- and
   head-orientation cues was comparable to that of chimpanzees, rhesus
   macaques, and ring-tailed lemurs-species living in much larger groups
   than gibbons. These findings support the continuity hypothesis that
   sensitivity to body- and head-orientation cues is a product of shared

Abstract = {Dendritic spines are postsynaptic protrusions at excitatory synapses
   that are critical for proper neuronal synaptic transmission. While lipid
   and protein membrane components are necessary for spine formation, it is
   largely unknown how they are recruited to developing spines. Endosomal
   trafficking is one mechanism that may influence this development. We
   recently reported that Lemur kinase 1A (LMTK1A), a membrane-bound
   Ser/Thr kinase, regulates trafficking of endosomes in neurons. LMTK1 has
   been shown to be a p35 Cdk5 activator-binding protein and a substrate
   for Cdk5-p35; however, its neuronal function has not been sufficiently
   studied. Here, we investigate the role of LMTK1 in spine formation.
   Depletion of LMTK1 increases spine formation, maturation, and density in
   primary cultured neurons and in mouse brain of either sex. Additionally,
   expression of kinase-negative LMTK1 stimulates spine formation in
   primary neurons and in vivo. LMTK1 controls spine formation through
   Rab11, a regulator of recycling endosome trafficking. We identify
   TBC1D9B, a Rab11A GTPase-activating protein (Rab11A GAP), as a LMTK1
   binding protein, and find that TBC1D9B mediates LMTK1 activity on
   Rab11A. TBC1D9B inactivates Rab11A under the control of LMTK1A. Further,
   by analyzing the effect of decreased TBC1D9B expression in primary
   neurons, we demonstrate that TBC1D9B indeed regulates spine formation.
   This is the first demonstration of the biological function of TBC1D9B.
   Together, with the regulation of LMTK1 by Cdk5-p35, we propose the
   Cdk5-LMTK1-TBC1D9B-Rab11A cascade as a novel signaling mechanism
   regulating endosomal transport for synapse formation and function.},

Title = {Zoological education: Can it change behaviour?},
Journal = {APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {220},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The behaviour of zoo visitors towards captive animals is a largely
   under-studied area of research. Evidence is beginning to emerge that
   certain behaviours by visitors like shouting, banging and staring can
   negatively affect animals. Previous methods to minimise negative visitor
   behaviours have primarily focused on physical exhibit alterations, such
   as barriers. The current study used an educational intervention (EI) in
   an attempt to decrease negative visitor behaviour and promote positive
   animal welfare. The visitors were groups of children, while three
   species of captive animals were studied: ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur
   catta), Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) and Gentoo penguins
   (Pygoscelis papua). The children were studied under two conditions: 1)
   control groups who did not receive an educational intervention and 2)
   treatment groups who received the educational intervention. Children's
   and animals' behaviour were simultaneously recorded using behaviour and
   scan sampling. The results showed a statistically significant reduction
   in negative behaviour by the children in the treatment groups at all
   three animal exhibits (ring-tailed lemurs: p=0.020; Humboldt penguins: p
   < 0.001; Gentoo penguins: p=0.031). Findings varied for the animals'
   behaviour. Generally, there was no corresponding change in the animals'
   behaviour associated with the presence of a treatment or control group.
   In conclusion, education programs in zoos could be enhanced by
   introducing programs aimed at reducing negative visitor behaviour.},

Title = {Theory of mind in animals: Current and future directions},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COGNITIVE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Theory of mind (ToM; a.k.a., mind-reading, mentalizing, mental-state
   attribution, and perspective-taking) is the ability to ascribe mental
   states, such as desires and beliefs, to others, and it is central to the
   unique forms of communication, cooperation, and culture that define our
   species. As a result, for 40 years, researchers have endeavored to
   determine whether ToM is itself unique to humans. Investigations in
   other species (e.g., apes, monkeys, corvids) are essential to understand
   the mechanistic underpinnings and evolutionary origins of this capacity
   across taxa, including humans. We review the literature on ToM in
   nonhuman animals, suggesting that some species share foundational social
   cognitive mechanisms with humans. We focus principally on innovations of
   the last decade and pressing directions for future work. Underexplored
   types of social cognition have been targeted, including ascription of
   mental states, such as desires and beliefs, that require simultaneously
   representing one's own and another's conflicting motives or views of the
   world. Ongoing efforts probe the motivational facets of ToM, how
   flexibly animals can recruit social cognitive skills across cooperative
   and competitive settings, and appropriate motivational contexts for
   comparative inquiry. Finally, novel methodological and empirical
   approaches have brought new species (e.g., lemurs, dogs) into the lab,
   implemented critical controls to elucidate underlying mechanisms, and
   contributed powerful new techniques (e.g., looking-time, eye-tracking)
   that open the door to unexplored approaches for studying animal minds.
   These innovations in cognition, motivation, and method promise fruitful
   progress in the years to come, in understanding the nature and origin of
   ToM in humans and other species. This article is categorized under:

Title = {Poverty not taste drives the consumption of protected species in

Abstract = {Bushmeat consumption in Madagascar is increasingly acknowledged as one
   of the major threats to its wild vertebrates. Nevertheless, few studies
   have examined the drivers of the consumption of protected versus legally
   huntable wild species, or examined its variance across Madagascar's
   protected and unprotected areas. This research provides a novel study of
   the consumption of protected, unprotected, and fish/eel species between
   forest types (deciduous and rainforest), as well as across a gradient of
   protected habitat (National Park, Reserve, Unprotected). Members of 1750
   households were interviewed across four regions, including two national
   parks, two reserves, and two unprotected forests. Household demographic,
   socioeconomic, cultural, and geographic variables were explored as
   possible predictors of bushmeat consumption. We found that poorer
   households reported consuming greater quantities of protected species
   whereas wealthier households reported consuming greater quantities of
   fish and eel. Households located inside Andasibe-Mantadia National Park,
   Madagascar's most visited protected area, reported consuming the
   greatest quantities of protected species. Interviewees' most favoured
   meat was from livestock, and fish. The consumption pattern of wild
   species reflected interviewees' stated preference for species that are
   either unlisted (e.g. tilapia fish) under Malagasy species protection
   laws, classified as pest (e.g. bushpig) and/or game species (e.g.
   tenrec). Most protected species (such as lemurs and carnivorans) were
   interviewees' least favoured wild meats. Given the lack of cultural
   affinity, and low preference for the consumption of most protected
   species, our results suggest that improving accessibility to domestic
   meat is a promising strategy for reducing the consumption of protected
   species.},

Title = {Beyond ecosystem services: Using charismatic megafauna as flagship
   species for mangrove forest conservation},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {9-17},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The flagship species paradigm (FSP) involves the selection of a species
   to strategically front conservation efforts and marketing campaigns.
   Chosen species are often charismatic megafauna: large animals with high
   public appeal that - in many ecosystems - receive considerable research
   attention and policy coverage. However, one ecosystem in which this
   trend is starkly reversed is the mangrove forest, where FSP approaches
   are rare due to under-acknowledgment or data deficiencies regarding
   their larger fauna. Instead, mangrove conservation has strongly embraced
   the ecosystem services paradigm (ESP) since these forests provide many
   benefits to society such as fisheries provision, coastal protection, and
   climate change mitigation via blue carbon sequestration. In this
   article, literature searches reveal that charismatic megafauna -
   including tigers, sloths, lemurs, proboscis monkeys, manatees, dolphins,
   sea turtles, crocodiles and sawfish - are severely under-represented in
   mangrove research, relative to their benthic invertebrates such as
   crabs, shrimp, and bivalves, explaining why the FSP remains
   underutilized for mangroves. We further reveal that many candidate
   flagships species may occur - permanently or periodically - in mangrove
   habitats around the world, indicating the FSP could have widespread
   applicability for mangrove conservation. Leveraging upon these findings,
   we highlight how the FSP can complement, or be integrated with, the ESP
   in the context of awareness raising, conservation finance, and policy

Title = {Palynostratigraphy of the Devonian-Carboniferous transition in the

Abstract = {Palynological assemblages from the Tulong succession in South Tibet
   enabled the recognition of three miospore biozones within the Zhangdong
   and `Yali' formations. In ascending order, they are the Retispora
   lepidophyta-Verrucosisporites nitidus (LN) Biozone, the Vallatisporites
   vallatus-Foveosporites pellucidus (VP) Biozone and the Rugospora
   polyptycha-Tricidarisporites arcuatus (PA) Biozone. The LN Biozone in
   the Tulong section can be correlated to the LN Biozone of Western
   Europe, based on the first and last appearances of many index miospore
   species. However, Tournaisian palynological assemblages of Western
   Europe and South Tibet show compositional differences. The VP and PA
   biozones of South Tibet are correlated tentatively to the VI-HD and
   BP-TC biozones of Western Europe based on the occurrences of rare
   miospore index species in both regions. The Zhangdong and `Yali'
   formations are now dated as Famennian to possibly earliest Visean. This
   age assessment is supported by rare conodonts and ammonoids recovered
   from intercalated limestones in the basal part of `Yali' Formation. In
   the Everest region, the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary is now placed c.
   10 m above the lower boundary of the `Yali' Formation, which was
   originally suggested by Lin and Qiu (1985) to be position of the D-C
   boundary. Unlike western Gondwana, i.e. Bolivia and Brazil, the
   Himalaya-Tethys zone at the northeastern margin of Gondwana does not
   show obvious lithological evidence for glaciations. The new
   palynostratigraphic data, including information on sea-level changes
   reflected by variations in palynological composition and lithology
   around the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary allow, an interregional,
   approximate correlation with the classical Hangenberg Event sequence in
   the Rhenish Massif. The analogous Hangenberg Event sequence in South
   Tibet further supports the hypothesis that the rapid Hangenberg Event
   regression/transgression was a global eustatic event of significant
   magnitude. The co-occurrence of probably reworked Frasnian Geminospora
   lemurata and Archaeoperisaccus spores in the Himalaya-Tethys zone
   indicates the palaeogeographical proximity of the northern margin of
   Gondwana to the South China Block in the palaeoequatorial belt.},

Title = {Adenovirus infection is associated with altered gut microbial
   communities in a non-human primate},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Adenovirus (AdV) infections are one of the main causes of diarrhea in
   young children. Enteric AdVs probably disrupt gut microbial defences,
   which can result in diarrhea. To understand the role of the gut
   microbiome in AdV-induced pathologies, we investigated the gut
   microbiome of a naturally AdV-infected non-human primate species, the
   Malagasy mouse lemur (Microcebus griseorufus), which represents an
   important model in understanding the evolution of diseases. We observed
   that AdV infection is associated with disruption of the gut microbial
   community composition. In AdV+ lemurs, several commensal taxa essential
   for a healthy gut microbiome decreased, whereas genera containing
   potential pathogens, such as Neisseria, increased in abundance.
   Microbial co-occurrence networks revealed a loss of important microbial
   community interactions in AdV+ lemurs and an overrepresentation of
   Prevotellaceae. The observation of enteric virus-associated loss of
   commensal bacteria and associated shifts towards pathobionts may
   represent the missing link for a better understanding of AdV-induced
   effects in humans, and also for their potential as drivers of
   co-infections, an area of research that has been largely neglected so
   far.},

Abstract = {We conducted a comparative analysis of primate cerebral size and
   neocortical folding using magnetic resonance imaging data from 65
   individuals belonging to 34 different species. We measured several
   neocortical folding parameters and studied their evolution using
   phylogenetic comparative methods. Our results suggest that the most
   likely model for neuroanatomical evolution is one where differences
   appear randomly (the Brownian Motion model), however, alternative models
   cannot be completely ruled out. We present estimations of the ancestral
   primate phenotypes as well as estimations of the rates of phenotypic
   change. Based on the Brownian Motion model, the common ancestor of
   primates may have had a folded cerebrum similar to that of a small lemur
   such as the aye aye. Finally, we observed a non-linear relationship
   between fold wavelength and fold depth with cerebral volume. In
   particular, gyrencephalic primate neocortices across different groups
   exhibited a strikingly stable fold wavelength of about 12 mm (+/- 20\%),
   despite a 20-fold variation in cerebral volume. We discuss our results
   in the context of current theories of neocortical folding. (C) 2019

Title = {Variations in the microbiome due to storage preservatives are not large

Abstract = {The study of the primate microbiome is critical in understanding the
   role of the microbial community in the host organism. To be able to
   isolate the main factors responsible for the differences observed in
   microbiomes within and between individuals, confounding factors due to
   technical variations need to be removed. To determine whether
   alterations due to preservatives outweigh differences due to factors
   such as host population, host species, body site, and habitat, we tested
   three methods (no preservative, 96\% ethanol, and RNAlater) for
   preserving wild chimpanzee (fecal), wild lemur (fecal), wild vervet
   monkey (rectal, oral, nasal, otic, vaginal, and penile), and captive
   vervet monkey (rectal) samples. All samples were stored below - 20
   degrees C (short term) at the end of the field day and then at - 80
   degrees C until DNA extraction. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we show
   a significant preservative effect on microbiota composition and
   diversity. Samples stored in ethanol and RNAlater appear to be less
   different compared with samples not stored in any preservative (none).
   Our differential analysis revealed significantly higher amounts of
   Enterococcaceae and Family XI in no preservative samples, Prevotellaceae
   and Spirochaetaceae in ethanol and RNAlater preserved samples,
   Oligosphaeraceae in ethanol-preserved samples, and Defluviitaleaceae in
   RNAlater preserved samples. While these preservative effects on the
   microbiome are not large enough to remove or outweigh the differences
   arising from biological factors (e.g., host species, body site, and
   habitat differences) they may promote misleading interpretations if they
   have large enough effect sizes compared to the biological factors (e.g.,
   host population).},

Title = {AN ENDEMIC FLORA OF DISPERSED SPORES FROM THE MIDDLE DEVONIAN OF IBERIA},

Abstract = {Diverse assemblages of dispersed spores have been recovered from Middle
   Devonian rocks in northern Spain, revealing a significant endemism in
   the flora. Middle Devonian Iberia was part of a relatively isolated
   island complex (Armorican Terrane Assemblage), separated by considerable
   tracts of ocean from Laurussia to the north-west and Gondwana to the
   south-east. The Middle Devonian deposits of the Cantabrian Zone of
   northern Spain are entirely marine and comprise a thick clastic unit
   sandwiched between extensive carbonate units. The clastic unit, the
   laterally equivalent Naranco, Huergas and Gustalapiedra formations of
   Asturias, Leon and Palencia provinces, represents a nearshore-offshore
   transect across a marine shelf. This unit is also believed to encompass
   the Kacak Event, an important global extinction event. The recovered
   palynomorphs include marine (phytoplankton, chitinozoans, scolecodonts)
   and terrestrial (spores) assemblages. These are abundant and well
   preserved, although of variable thermal maturity. Here, we describe the
   dispersed spores and consider their significance as regards
   biostratigraphy, palaeophytogeography and Kacak Event interpretation.
   The dispersed spores represent a single assemblage assignable to the
   lemurata-langii Assemblage Zone (lemurata Subzone) indicating a probable
   early (but not earliest) Givetian age. Signs of endemism include various
   taxa known only from this region, some taxa appearing to have discordant
   ranges compared with elsewhere, and the absence from Iberia of certain
   prominent taxa characteristic of coeval assemblages elsewhere, such as
   those with grapnel-tipped processes. The abrupt interruption of
   carbonate deposition, with a change to rapid deposition of thick clastic
   deposits, provides support for a monsoonal cause of the Kacak Event.},

Abstract = {Natural rafting is an easy, non-evidence-based solution often used to
   explain the presence of a variety of species on isolated islands. The
   question arises as to whether this solution is based on solid scientific
   grounds. It is a plausible colonisation route only if intricate networks
   of variables are considered and many different conditions satisfied.
   This review provides a descriptive account of some of the most critical
   issues underlying the theory of natural rafting that should be addressed
   by its supporters. These include: (i) biological variables; (ii)
   characteristics of the vessels; and (iii) physical variables. Natural
   rafting may explain the dispersal of poikilotherms with low metabolic
   rates and low resource requirements that could withstand trans-oceanic
   crossings, but explaining the transport of homeothermic terrestrial
   mammals to oceanic islands is more problematic. Drifting at sea exposes
   organisms to high concentrations of salt, high temperature and humidity
   excursions, starvation, and above all to dehydration. A sufficiently
   large group of healthy reproductive individuals of the two sexes should
   either be transported together, or be able to reassemble after separate
   crossings, to prevent inbreeding, genetic drift and ultimately
   extinction. Any vessels of flotsam occupied must minimally provide the
   animals they transport with sufficient provisions to survive the
   journey, offer minimum friction and drag through water, and be
   transported by appropriately directed, sustained, high-speed currents.
   Thus, a `sweepstakes colonisation' event would be the result of a lucky
   combination of all, or at least the majority, of these factors. Some
   cases throw doubt on the use of a natural rafting model to explain known
   animal colonisations, with one of the most striking examples being
   Madagascar. This island is far from the nearest mainland coasts and the
   sea currents in the Mozambique Channel are directed towards Africa
   rather than Madagascar, yet, the island was colonised by terrestrial
   mammals (e.g. extinct hippopotamuses, lemurs, carnivores, rodents and
   tenrecs) unable to swim and to survive long journeys at sea. In order to
   assess the feasibility of the natural rafting model in a case such as
   Madagascar, tests were performed using three variables for which enough
   information could be obtained from the literature: length of survival
   without food, survival without water, and sea current speed. The
   distributions of these variables appear to be log-normal and
   multiplicative, or follow a power-law, rather than being Gaussian. The
   tests suggest that a distributional analysis is a more suitable approach
   than the use of geometric probability to calculate the probabilities
   associated with the examined data. Such non-linear and self-organising
   systems may reach a critical point governed by different competing
   factors. Mammals with high survival requirements, such as lemurs and
   hippopotamuses, thus may have a virtually zero probability of reaching
   distant islands by natural rafting. Our results raise doubts as to the
   validity of a natural rafting model, and we urge a rethinking of the
   modes in which numerous islands were colonised by land mammals and a
   careful revision of past geological and phylogeographic work.},

Abstract = {Giardiasis is a common gastrointestinal disease of humans and various
   animal species worldwide. In this study, 302 stool samples were
   collected from West African Dwarf and Sokoto Red breeds of goats in Ogun
   State, Nigeria, and screened for Giardia intestinalis coproantigens
   using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The genotypes of G.
   intestinalis in faecal samples collected from 152 goats raised on
   selected farms were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
   amplification and sequence analyses of the small subunit ribosomal RNA
   (ssu rRNA), glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), triosephosphate isomerase
   (tpi) and beta-giardin (bg) genes. Based on ELISA, an overall prevalence
   of 45.7\% was recorded with the infection rates in pre-weaned (60.2\%)
   and postweaned goat kids (51.5\%) being significantly (p < 0.05) higher
   than in adults (28.2\%). Giardia intestinalis DNA was amplified in
   31.6\% and 29.6\% of goat faeces at the ssu rRNA and gdh loci
   respectively. These were genotyped at the ssu rRNA locus as assemblages
   B (n = 13) and E (n = 36). Similar results were observed at the gdh
   locus except that eight isolates contained assemblage E mixed with
   either assemblage A or B. Additionally, subassemblages BI (n = 7) and
   BIII (n = 2) were identified with up to four single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) occurring in these isolates. Multilocus genotypes
   (MLG) of all assemblage E isolates were identified using the ssu rRNA
   and gdh loci while MLG of all isolates containing assemblage B and mixed
   assemblages were determined after further typing at the pi and bg loci.
   Forty-two MLG isolates were identified and these comprised 32, 8 and 2
   (sub)-assemblage E, BI and BIII respectively. All isolates with mixed
   assemblages at the gdh locus were consequently designated as assemblage
   E by MLG. The assemblage E isolates from goats were genetically related
   to isolates from cattle, sheep and goats while the assemblage B isolates
   were related to isolates of human, pig and lemur origin. This suggests
   that G. intestinalis isolated from goats bred in Ogun State, Nigeria may
   be capable of cross-species transmission and may be of zoonotic
   importance.},

Abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that has been
   detected in different animal species. A survey study was carried out to
   assess HEV infection in non-human primates (NHPs) housed in zoos in
   Spain. Anti-HEV antibodies were detected in eight of the 181 NHPs tested
   (4.4\%; 95\%CI: 1.4-7.4). At least one seropositive animal was detected
   in five of the 33 species sampled (15.2\%). This is the first report of
   seropositivity in black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata),
   common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and Barbary macaques (Macaca
   sylvanus). Anti-HEV antibodies were found in six of the eight zoos
   included in the study (75.0\%). Seroconversion was detected in one
   chimpanzee, which confirms HEV circulation in one zoo between 2015 and
   2016. Seropositivity was significantly higher in hominids than in other
   NHP families. HEV RNA was not detected in any of the serum samples
   tested. The results indicate susceptibility of NHPs to HEV infection.
   Further studies are required to elucidate the role of these species in
   the epidemiology of HEV.},

Title = {Internal nasal morphology of the Eocene primate Rooneyia viejaensis and
   extant Euarchonta: Using mu CT scan data to understand and infer
   patterns of nasal fossa evolution in primates},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {132},

Abstract = {Primates have historically been viewed as having a diminished sense of
   smell compared to other mammals. In haplorhines, olfactory reduction has
   been inferred partly based on the complexity of the bony turbinals
   within the nasal cavity. Some turbinals are covered in olfactory
   epithelium, which contains olfactory receptor neurons that detect
   odorants. Accordingly, turbinal number and complexity has been used as a
   rough anatomical proxy for the relative importance of olfactory cues for
   an animal's behavioral ecology. Unfortunately, turbinals are delicate
   and rarely preserved in fossil specimens, limiting opportunities to make
   direct observations of the olfactory periphery in extinct primates. Here
   we describe the turbinal morphology of Rooneyia viejaensis, a late
   middle Eocene primate of uncertain phylogenetic affinities from the
   Tornillo Basin of West Texas. This species is currently the oldest
   fossil primate for which turbinals are preserved with minimal damage or
   distortion. Microcomputed tomography (KT) reveals that Rooneyia
   possessed 1 nasoturbinal, 4 bullar ethmoturbinals, 1 frontoturbinal, 1
   interturbinal, and an olfactory recess. This pattern is broadly similar
   to the condition seen in some extant strepsirrhine primates but differs
   substantially from the condition seen in extant haplorhines. Crown
   haplorhines possess only two ethmoturbinals and lack frontoturbinals,
   interturbinals, and an olfactory recess. Additionally, crown anthropoids
   have ethmoturbinals that are non-bullar. These observations reinforce
   the conclusion that Rooneyia is not a stem tarsiiform or stem
   anthropoid. However, estimated olfactory turbinal surface area in
   Rooneyia is greater than that of similar-sized haplorhines but smaller
   than that of similar-sized lemuriforms and lorisiforms. This finding
   suggests that although Rooneyia was broadly plesiomorphic in retaining a
   large complement of olfactory turbinals as in living strepsirrhines,
   Rooneyia may have evolved somewhat diminished olfactory abilities as in
   living haplorhines. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We report here the first record of five genera of Spongillida (Porifera,
   Demospongiae) in both lentic and lotic water of Madagascar and the
   discovery of a new species of the genus Corvospongilla from the
   Betsiboka River hydrographic basin. Corvospongilla lemuriensis sp. n.
   diverges from all the other known species of the genus in its unique
   combination of diagnostic morphotraits (a) sessile gemmules with
   chambered pneumatic layer within tri-layered theca and enveloped by
   spicular cage of dominant acanthostrongyles, (b) dominant
   acanthostrongyles and less frequent acanthoxeas-strongyloxeas as
   megascleres and gemmuloscleres. The new species is characterised by the
   exclusive presence of a well-developed pneumatic layer in sessile
   gemmules not described for the genus until now. The new record confirms
   a Gondwanian track for the genus Corvospongilla and increases the
   knowledge on Spongillida historical biogeography. In synthesis the
   present discovery of Corvospongilla in the Malagasy biogeographic
   province (a) contributes to the assessment of Afrotropical biodiversity,
   (b) enlarges the geographic range of the genus reducing its disjunct
   distribution, and (c) focus on the evolutionary history of adaptive
   morphofunctional traits of resting bodies and life cycle timing in
   ephemeral water of the south-eastern Austral hemisphere.},

Abstract = {In this contribution to the study of gryllacridines or raspy crickets
   (Orthoptera: Gryllacrididae), a new proposal for classification of this
   family is provided, dividing it into two subfamilies and ten tribes that
   includes most of the 114 known genera to date (including the new genera
   described here). It describes and redefines two subfamilies:
   Hyperbaeninae n. subf. and Gryllacridinae n. sensu, ten tribes:
   Phryganogryllacridini n. trib., Capnogryllacridini n. trib.,
   Asarcogryllacridini n. trib., Hyperbaenini n. trib., Paragryllacridini
   n. trib., Ametrini n. trib., Ametroidini n. trib., Gryllacridini n.
   sensu., Eremini n. trib. and Progryllacridini n. trib.; ten genera:
   Claudiagryllacris n. gen., Griffinigryllacris n. gen.,
   Gorochovgryllacris n. gen., Ingrishgryllacris n. gen., Rentzgryllacris
   n. gen., Willemsegryllacris n. gen., Karnygryllacris n. gen.,
   Brunnergryllacris n. gen., Bianigryllacris n. gen. and Hugelgryllacris
   n. gen.; seven genera groups: Gryllacrae n. group. (placed under
   Gryllacridini n. trib. comprising ten genera: Caustogryllacris,
   Eugryllacris, Gryllacris, Lypero-gryllacris, Nesogryllacris,
   Ocellarnaca, Phlebogryllacris, Prosopogryllacris, Willemsegryllacris n.
   gen. and Xanthogryllacris), Metriogryllacrae n. group. (under
   Gryllacridini grouped Metriogryllacris, Homogryllacris, Pseudasarca n.
   stat. and Furcilarnaca), Anancistrogerae (Anancistrogera, Ancistrogera,
   Angustogryllacris, Aphanogryllacris, Celebogryllacris),
   Triaenogryllacrae n. group. (under Gryllacridinae only comprising
   Triaenogryllacris) the next groups under Ametrini n. trib.: Ametrae n.
   group. (comprising two genera: Ametrus and Pareremus), Apotrechae n.
   group. (including three genera: Apotrechus, Apterolarnaca and
   Bianigryllacris n. gen.) and Apteronomae n. group. (comprising two
   genera: Ametrosomus and Apteronomus).
   The status of Dictogryllacris reinst. stat., was restored, previously
   transferred by Gorochov 2003 as subgenus of Capnogryllacris and to
   Pseudasarca n. stat. as full genus status is proposed. One genera, one
   subgenus and one fossil species are synonymized: Xiphogryllacris n. syn.
   (under Hyalogryllacris) and dagger Gryllacris brevip-pennis n. syn.
   (under dagger Macrelcana ungeri). The subgenus Glolarnaca n. stat.
   (included under Zalarnaca), is considered as full genus in
   Gryllacridinae (Gryllacridini). 57 new combinations are proposed, with
   particular emphasis on Niphetogryllacris, placing 36 of the 43 existing
   species of the genus: Pissodogryllacris tesellata n. comb.,
   Willemsegryllacris barnesi n. comb. (previously placed under
   Gryllacris), Afrogryllacris nigripceps n. comb. (previously placed under
   in Barombogryllacris), Anancistrogera nigroscutata n. comb., A.
   cornualis n. comb. and A. genualis n. comb. (included by Karny in
   Caustogryllacris and by Gorochov in the subgenus Pseudolarnaca, here
   transfered to Anancistrogera), Hugelgryllacris tchancha n. comb. (before
   in Psilogryllacris), Diaphanogryllacris annandalei n. comb., D.
   barkudensis n. comb., D. dravida n. comb., D. gravelyi n. comb.,
   Claudiagryllacris finoti n. comb. C. stigmata n. comb., C. lemur n.

   comb., S. ametroides n. comb., S. jacobi n. comb., S. kilimandjarica n.
   comb., S. meruensis n. comb.; S. neglecta n. comb.; S. submutica n.
   comb., Griffinigryllacris reunionis n. comb., G adelungi n. comb., G
   mauritiana n. comb., Karnygryllacris occipitalis n. comb., K. atriceps
   n. comb., K. brevipennis n. comb., K. humilis n. comb., K. scurra n.
   comb., K. triocellata n. comb., K. pittarellii n. comb., K. grylloides
   n. comb., Brunnergryllacris testaceus n. comb. and B. eximia n. comb
   (previously placed under Niphetogryllacris), Rentzgryllacris
   sechellensis n. comb. (before in Prosopogryllacris and the three
   subspecies are treated as full species), Gorochovgryllacris navicula n.
   comb. (transferred from Brachybaenus), Bianigryllacris trilobus n.
   comb., B. bilobus n. comb., B. digitatus n. comb., B. fallax n. comb.,
   B. nigrigeniculatus n. comb., B. parvospinus n. comb., B. quadratus n.
   comb. and B. transversus n. comb. (previously placed under Apotrechus),
   Hyalogryllacris orthoxipha n. comb. (previously placed under
   Xiphogryllacris), Afroneanias glauningi n. comb., A. sphinix n. comb.
   and Ingrishgryllacris brevifalcatus n. comb. (previously placed under
   Ametroides and Glomeremus respectively).
   A key to the identification of the subfamilies and tribes is provided,
   plus historical background of the major taxonomic works on the group and
   the few contributions on ecology, morphology, and behavior is also done.
   It also discusses the status of fossil taxa thought to belong to the
   family. A preliminary analysis of the zoogeography of the family from
   the parameters of richness, diversity and distribution patterns of
   different groups studied, and also, some final comments on what has been
   achieved in this contribution are give, what is missing to the study of
   gryllacridines to the future and some problems that still affect the
   taxonomy to genera and species level. Finally, a check list in which all
   family taxa are included with the new classification is provided, with
   some comments on their distribution and taxonomic status if necessary.},

Title = {True Homoplasy of Retrotransposon Insertions in Primates},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Pages = {482-493},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {How reliable are the presence/absence insertion patterns of the
   supposedly homoplasy-free retrotransposons, which were randomly inserted
   in the quasi infinite genomic space? To systematically examine this
   question in an up-to-date, multigenome comparison, we screened millions
   of primate transposed Alu SINE elements for incidences of homoplasious
   precise insertions and deletions. In genome-wide analyses, we identified
   and manually verified nine cases of precise parallel Alu insertions of
   apparently identical elements at orthologous positions in two ape
   lineages and twelve incidences of precise deletions of previously
   established SINEs. Correspondingly, eight precise parallel insertions
   and no exact deletions were detected in a comparison of lemuriform
   primate and human insertions spanning the range of primate diversity.
   With an overall frequency of homoplasious Alu insertions of only 0.01\%
   (for human-chimpanzee-rhesus macaque) and 0.02-0.04\% (for
   human-bushbaby-lemurs) and precise Alu deletions of 0.001-0.002\% (for
   human-chimpanzee-rhesus macaque), real homoplasy is not considered to be
   a quantitatively relevant source of evolutionary noise. Thus,
   presence/absence patterns of Alu retrotransposons and, presumably, all
   LINE1-mobilized elements represent indeed the virtually homoplasy-free
   markers they are considered to be. Therefore, ancestral incomplete
   lineage sorting and hybridization remain the only serious sources of
   conflicting presence/absence patterns of retrotransposon insertions, and
   as such are detectable and quantifiable.},

Title = {A new interpretation of Madagascar's megafaunal decline: The
   ``Subsistence Shift Hypothesis{''}},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {126-140},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Fundamental disagreements remain regarding the relative importance of
   climate change and human activities as triggers for Madagascar's
   Holocene megafaunal extinction. We use stable isotope data from
   stalagmites from northwest Madagascar coupled with radiocarbon and
   butchery records from subfossil bones across the island to investigate
   relationships between megafaunal decline, climate change, and habitat
   modification. Archaeological and genetic evidence support human presence
   by 2000 years Before Common Era (BCE). Megafaunal decline was at first
   slow; it hastened at similar to 700 Common Era (CE) and peaked between
   750 and 850 CE, just before a dramatic vegetation transformation in the
   northwest that resulted in the replacement of C-3 woodland habitat with
   C-4 grasslands, during a period of heightened monsoonal activity. Cut
   and chop marks on subfossil lemur bones reveal a shift in primary
   hunting targets from larger, now-extinct species prior to similar to 900
   CE, to smaller, still-extant species afterwards. By 1050 CE, megafaunal
   populations had essentially collapsed. Neither the rapid megafaunal
   decline beginning similar to 700 CE, nor the dramatic vegetation
   transformation in the northwest beginning similar to 890 CE, was
   influenced by aridification. However, both roughly coincide with a major
   transition in human subsistence on the island from hunting/foraging to
   herding/farming.
   We offer a new hypothesis, which we call the ``Subsistence Shift
   Hypothesis,{''} to explain megafaunal decline and extinction in
   Madagascar. This hypothesis acknowledges the importance of wild-animal
   hunting by early hunter/foragers, but more critically highlights
   negative impacts of the shift from hunting/foraging to herding/farming,
   settlement by new immigrant groups, and the concomitant expansion of the
   island's human population. The interval between 700 and 900 CE, when the
   pace of megafaunal decline quickened and peaked, coincided with this
   economic transition. While early megafaunal decline through hunting may
   have helped to trigger the transition, there is strong evidence that the
   economic shift itself hastened the crash of megafaunal populations. (C)

Title = {Context-specific response inhibition and differential impact of a

Journal = {ANIMAL COGNITION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {317-329},

Abstract = {Response inhibition (inhibiting prepotent responses) is needed for
   reaching a more favourable goal in situations where reacting
   automatically would be detrimental. Inhibiting prepotent responses to
   resist the temptation of a stimulus in certain situations, such as a
   novel food item, can directly affect an animal's survival. In humans and
   dogs, response inhibition varies between contexts and between
   individuals. We used two contextually different experiments to
   investigate response inhibition in the eastern water skink (Eulamprus
   quoyii): reversal of a visual two-choice discrimination and a cylinder
   detour task. During the two-choice task, half of our lizards were able
   to reach an initial learning criterion, but, thereafter, did not show
   consistent performance. Only two individuals reached a more stringent
   criterion, but subsequently failed during reversals. Furthermore, half
   of our animals were not able to inhibit a pre-existing side preference
   which affected their ability to learn during the two-choice task. Skinks
   were, however, able to achieve a detour around a cylinder performing at
   levels comparable to brown lemurs, marmosets, and some parrot species. A
   comparison between the tasks showed that reaching the initial criterion
   was associated with low success during the detour task, indicating that
   response inhibition could be context-specific in the water skink. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine inhibitory
   control and motor self-regulation in a lizard species.},

Title = {The lncRNA MIR2052HG regulates ER alpha levels and aromatase inhibitor
   resistance through LMTK3 by recruiting EGR1},
Journal = {BREAST CANCER RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Background: Our previous genome-wide association study using the MA.27
   aromatase inhibitors adjuvant trial identified SNPs in the long
   noncoding RNA MIR2052HG associated with breast cancer-free interval.
   MIR2052HG maintained ER alpha both by promoting AKT/FOXO3-mediated ESR1
   transcription and by limiting ubiquitin-mediated ER alpha degradation.
   Our goal was to further elucidate MIR2052HG's mechanism of action.
   Methods: RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assays were performed
   to demonstrate that the transcription factor, early growth response
   protein 1 (EGR1), worked together with MIR2052HG to regulate that lemur
   tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3) transcription in MCF7/AC1 and CAMA-1 cells.
   The location of EGR1 on the LMTK3 gene locus was mapped using chromatin
   immunoprecipitation assays. The co-localization of MIR2052HG RNA and the
   LMTK3 gene locus was determined using RNA-DNA dual fluorescent in situ
   hybridization. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) effects were
   evaluated using a panel of human lymphoblastoid cell lines.
   Results: MIR2052HG depletion in breast cancer cells results in a
   decrease in LMTK3 expression and cell growth. Mechanistically, MIR2052HG
   interacts with EGR1 and facilitates its recruitment to the LMTK3
   promoter. LMTK3 sustains ER levels by reducing protein kinase C (PKC)
   activity, resulting in increased ESR1 transcription mediated through
   AKT/FOXO3 and reduced ER alpha degradation mediated by the
   PKC/MEK/ERK/RSK1 pathway. MIR2052HG regulated LMTK3 in a SNP- and
   aromatase inhibitor-dependent fashion: the variant SNP increased EGR1
   binding to LMTK3 promoter in response to androstenedione, relative to
   wild-type genotype, a pattern that can be reversed by aromatase
   inhibitor treatment. Finally, LMTK3 overexpression abolished the effect
   of MIR2052HG on PKC activity and ER alpha levels.
   Conclusions: Our findings support a model in which the MIR2052HG
   regulates LMTK3 via EGR1, and LMTK3 regulates ER alpha stability via the
   PKC/MEK/ERK/RSK1 axis. These results reveal a direct role of MIR2052HG
   in LMTK3 regulation and raise the possibilities of targeting MIR2052HG
   or LMTK3 in ER alpha-positive breast cancer.},

   DNA extraction and minibarcode amplification},

Abstract = {In lieu of the importance of species authentication of processed fishery
   products, no reports have been made on sardine products in the
   Philippines. This is partly because of the challenges in dealing with
   biological material that has been subjected to extreme conditions during
   the process. Although molecular tools are now within reach, they are
   often reliant on proprietary kits which make the process expensive. In
   this paper, we used hot sodium hydroxide and Iris (HotSHOT) DNA
   extraction protocol and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) minibarcode
   amplification to genotype and identify selected brands of
   locally-produced canned and dried sardines. To validate, fresh
   representatives based on advertised and suspected identities of the
   processed samples were geno-typed as well. Success rate of amplification
   has gone from 0\% to 64\% when the minibarcode was amplified, as opposed
   to using the full-length COI barcoding region. Phylogenetic analysis
   allowed for the successful identification of processed Sardinella
   lemuru. Species substitution was detected on samples marketed as dried
   tawilis; however, the resolving power of minibarcode was not enough to
   discriminate the samples up to the species level. Regardless, coupling
   HotSHOT extraction with minibarcode amplification proved to be effective
   with processed sardines. Using this method to authenticate other
   processed fishery products that have underwent extreme postharvest
   processing warrants further exploration.},

Abstract = {Arachidonic acid lipoxygenases (ALOXs) are lipid-metabolizing enzymes
   that have been implicated in cell differentiation, but also in the
   pathogenesis of inflammatory, hyperproliferative and neurological
   diseases. Most mammalian genomes involve six or seven functional ALOX
   genes and among the corresponding ALOX-isoforms the ALOX15 orthologs are
   somewhat unique since they exhibit variable reaction specificity using
   arachidonic acid as substrate. The Evolutionary Hypothesis of mammalian
   ALOX15 reaction specificity (Prog. Lipid Res. 72, 55, 2018) suggests
   that ALOX15 orthologs of primates ranked higher in evolution than
   gibbons are 15-lipoxygenating enzymes. In contrast, mammals ranking
   lower than gibbons express dominantly 12-lipoxygenating lipoxygenases
   and gibbon ALOX15 constitutes a transition enzyme with pronounced dual
   reaction specificity. Here we predicted the reaction specificity of 95
   different prototherian, metatherian and eutherian ALOX15 orthologs on
   the basis of their primary structures and characterized experimentally
   the reaction specificity of ten novel metatherian/eutherian enzymes
   representing different stages of mammalian evolution (gorilla, opossum,
   cape golden mole, dog, horseshoe bat, hedgehog, Sunda flying lemur,
   pika, chinchilla, kangaroo rat). We found that 97\% of the currently
   sequenced mammalian ALOX15 including the enzymes of living and extinct
   hominids follow the Evolutionary Hypothesis. However, the ALOX15
   orthologs of rabbits and of the Ord's kangaroo rat violate this
   mechanistic concept. Taken together, this data confirms the Evolutionary
   Hypothesis of ALOX15 reaction specificity and puts this concept on a
   more reliable experimental basis.},

Title = {LMTK3 is essential for oncogenic KIT expression in KIT-mutant GIST and

Pages = {1200-1210},

Abstract = {Certain cancers, including gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and
   subsets of melanoma, are caused by somatic KIT mutations that result in
   KIT receptor tyrosine kinase constitutive activity, which drives
   proliferation. The treatment of KIT-mutant GIST has been revolutionized
   with the advent of KIT-directed cancer therapies. KIT tyrosine kinase
   inhibitors (TKI) are superior to conventional chemotherapy in their
   ability to control advanced KIT-mutant disease. However, these therapies
   have a limited duration of activity due to drug-resistant secondary KIT
   mutations that arise (or that are selected for) during KIT TKI
   treatment. To overcome the problem of KIT TKI resistance, we sought to
   identify novel therapeutic targets in KIT-mutant GIST and melanoma cells
   using a human tyrosine kinome siRNA screen. From this screen, we
   identified lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) and herein describe its role
   as a novel KIT regulator in KIT-mutant GIST and melanoma cells. We find
   that LMTK3 regulated the translation rate of KIT, such that loss of
   LMTK3 reduced total KIT, and thus KIT downstream signaling in cancer
   cells. Silencing of LMTK3 decreased cell viability and increased cell
   death in KIT-dependent, but not KIT-independent GIST and melanoma cell
   lines. Notably, LMTK3 silencing reduced viability of all KIT-mutant cell
   lines tested, even those with drug-resistant KIT secondary mutations.
   Furthermore, targeting of LMTK3 with siRNA delayed KIT-dependent GIST
   growth in a xenograft model. Our data suggest the potential of LMTK3 as
   a target for treatment of patients with KIT-mutant cancer, particularly
   after failure of KIT TKIs.},

Abstract = {Alveolar echinococcosis, the disease caused by infection with the
   intermediate stage of the Echinococcus multilocularis tapeworm, is
   typically fatal in humans and dogs when left untreated. Since 2012,
   alveolar echinococcosis has been diagnosed in 5 dogs, 3 lemurs, and 1
   chipmunk in southern Ontario, Canada, a region previously considered
   free of these tapeworms. Because of human and animal health concerns, we
   estimated prevalence of infection in wild canids across southern
   Ontario. During 2015-2017, we collected fecal samples from 460 wild
   canids (416 coyotes, 44 foxes) during postmortem examination and
   analyzed them by using a semiautomated magnetic capture probe DNA
   extraction and real-time PCR method for E. multilocularis DNA.
   Surprisingly, 23\% (95\% CI 20\%-27\%) of samples tested positive. By
   using a spatial scan test, we identified an infection cluster (relative
   risk 2.26; p = 0.002) in the western-central region of the province. The
   cluster encompasses areas of dense human population, suggesting zoonotic
   transmission.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 23},
Abstract = {Physical and cognitive performances change across lifespan. Studying
   cohorts of individuals in specific age ranges and athletic abilities
   remains essential in assessing the underlying physiological mechanisms
   that result in such a drop in performance. This decline is now viewed as
   a unique phenotypic biomarker and a hallmark of the aging process. The
   rates of decline are well documented for sets of traits such as running
   or swimming but only a limited number of studies have examined the
   developmental and senescent phases together. Moreover, the few attempts
   to do so are merely descriptive and do not include any meaningful
   biological features. Here we propose an averaged and deterministic
   model, based on cell population dynamics, replicative senescence and
   functionality loss. It describes the age-related change of performance
   in 17 time-series phenotypic traits, including human physical and
   cognitive skills, mouse lemur strength, greyhound and thoroughbred
   speed, and mouse activity. We demonstrate that the estimated age of peak
   performance occurs in the early part of life (20.5\% +/- 6.6\% of the
   estimated lifespan) thus emphasizing the asymmetrical nature of the
   relationship. This model is an initial attempt to relate performance
   dynamics to cellular dynamics and will lead to more sophisticated models
   in the future.},

Abstract = {The mitochondrial genome of a blacktip sardinella, Sardinella melanura
   was determined by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technique. The
   mitogenome of S. melanura (16,646 bp), encoded the canonical 37
   mitochondrial structural genes (13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA
   genes, two rRNA genes). The gene arrangement of S. melanura was
   identical to its relative species including Sardinella lemuru,
   Sardinella longiceps and Sardinella gibbosa. Except for COX1 (GTG), all
   the other PCGs showed the typical ATG as start codon. Incomplete stop
   codons were identified in ND2, COX2, COX3, ND3, ND4, and Cytb. The
   phylogenetic tree result showed that S. melanura was most closely
   related to S. jussieu, S. lemuru, and Sardinella maderansis with 83\%
   identity, respectively.},

Title = {The most frog-diverse place in Middle America, with notes on the

Abstract = {Regarding amphibians, Costa Rica exhibits the greatest species richness
   per unit area in Middle America, with a total of 215 species reported to
   date. However, this number is likely an underestimate due to the
   presence of many unexplored areas that are difficult to access. Between
   2012 and 2017, a monitoring survey of amphibians was conducted in the
   Central Caribbean of Costa Rica, on the northern edge of the Matama
   mountains in the Talamanca mountain range, to study the distribution
   patterns and natural history of species across this region, particularly
   those considered as endangered by the International Union for
   Conservation of Nature. The results show the highest amphibian species
   richness among Middle America lowland evergreen forests, with a notable
   anuran representation of 64 species. The greatest diversity in the study
   area occurred in the mature forest on the basal belt. Of the 68
   amphibian species found, seven (10\%) are endemic to the Atlantic
   versant and eight (11.6\%) are threatened. This survey includes the
   first record of Gastrotheca cornuta in Costa Rica since it was last
   reported 21 years ago. New populations of Agalychnis lemur (Critically
   Endangered) and Duellmanohyla uranochroa (Endangered) are reported, and
   Ecnomiohyla veraguensis (Endangered) is reported for the first time in
   Costa Rica. These findings show that this locality is a high priority
   conservation area for a large number of amphibian species, which are
   often threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation.},

Title = {Remotely releasable collar mechanism for medium-sized mammals: an
   affordable technology to avoid multiple captures},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Abstract = {Collar-mounted monitoring devices for collecting behavioural or
   positional data (e.g. sound recorders, accelerometers, GPS, VHF) are
   increasingly used in wildlife research. Although these tools represent
   an improvement in terms of data quality, they require capturing animals.
   Using remotely releasable collars allows for reducing the number of
   captures by half; however, currently this technology is primarily
   available for large mammals. Here, we present a locking mechanism design
   that is remotely releasable and light enough (22 g) for medium-sized
   mammals (>1 kg), can run in low-power mode for years, is reusable
   directly after recharge, and has a material cost of less than (sic)50.
   An Android application operates this mechanism over a Bluetooth
   connection. We developed custom-purpose software for both the locking
   mechanism and the Android application. We tested two collars equipped
   with this locking mechanism in field-like conditions on two ring-tailed
   lemurs Lemur catta. The release mechanism has an operational range of
   10-50 m and can run in active mode (allowing remote release) for several
   hours. Implementation of the presented release mechanism for collars on
   medium-sized mammals provides a low-cost solution to reduce the number
   of captures. We demonstrate that some low-cost technical improvements of
   tools used for studying wildlife can have significant effects on
   reducing the stress experienced by animals during capture. Detailed
   description of this new mechanism design provides a starting-block for
   potential adaptations for a broader range of species.},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {The gut microbiomes of mammals appear to mirror their hosts' phylogeny,
   suggesting host-driven microbial community assembly. Yet, much of this
   evidence stems from comparative studies of distinct wild or captive
   populations that lack data for disentangling the relative influences of
   shared phylogeny and environment. Here, we present phylogenetic and
   multivariate analyses of gut microbiomes from six sympatric (i.e.,
   co-occurring) mammal species inhabiting a 1-km(2) area in western
   Madagascar-three lemur and three non-primate species-that consider
   genetic, dietary, and ecological predictors of microbiome functionality
   and composition. Host evolutionary history, indeed, appears to shape gut
   microbial patterns among both closely and distantly related species.
   However, we also find that diet-reliance on leaves versus fruit-is the
   best predictor of microbiome similarity among closely related lemur
   species, and that host substrate use-ground versus tree-constrains
   horizontal transmission via incidental contact with feces, with arboreal
   species harboring far more distinct communities than those of their
   terrestrial and semi-terrestrial counterparts.},

   LFO and P2: 40\% grass king + 57\% concentrate + 3\% saponified PO. Each
   treatment consisted of 3 replications. The observed variables were
   physical quality of meat (pH, cooking losses, tenderness, collagen). The
   data obtained were analyzed by variance analysis and real difference
   test between treatments. The results showed that the use of LFO and PO
   was not significant effect (P>0.05) on the physical quality of meat (pH,

Abstract = {The research was conducted to investigate the effect of supplementation
   of cellulase, carnitine and tuna fish oil on lipid and fatty acid
   contents of Indonesian native chicken meats. A total of 120 male native
   chickens was allocated randomly to 4 dietary treatments with 6
   replicates of 5 birds. The basal diet, which was consisted of corn, rice
   bran and layer concentrate, was defined as T1. The remaining 3 dietary
   treatments were the basal diet + 0.1\% cellulase enzyme (T2), basal diet
   + 0.1\% cellulase enzyme + 30 ppm L-carnitine (T3), basal diet + 0.1\%
   cellulase enzyme + 30 ppm L-carnitine + 4\% lemuru fish oil (T4). The
   dietary treatments were fed for 90 days. Supplementation of cellulase
   enzyme did not influence the lipid, cholesterol and fatty acid contents
   in the meats. Supplementation of carnitine in the diet containing
   cellulase enzyme decreased cholesterol content (P<0.05) without
   affecting lipid and fatty acid contents in the meats. Furthermore,
   supplementation of lemuru fish oil in the diet containing cellulase
   enzyme and carnitine enhanced the lipid, high-density lipoprotein and
   unsaturated fatty acid contents, including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty

Abstract = {The meat quality characteristics were influenced by the chemical quality
   of the meat. This study aimed to observe the effect of saponified animal
   oil (lemuru fish oil: LFO) and vegetable oil (palm oil: PO) addition in
   the ration on the chemical quality of lamb meat on Longissimus dorsi.
   Twelve male local lamb were randomly divided into 3 ration treatments;
   P0: control ration (40\% king grass: 60\% concentrate), P1: 40\% king
   grass + 57\% concentrated + 3\% saponified LFO and P2: 40\% grass king +
   57\% concentrate 3\% saponified PO. Each treatment consisted of 3
   replications. The observed variables were the chemical quality of meat
   (moisture, fat, protein and cholesterol). The data obtained were
   analyzed by analysis of variance and real difference test between
   treatments. The results showed that the use of LFO and PO has no
   significant effect (P>0.05) on the chemical quality of meat (moisture,
   fat, protein and cholesterol). It can be concluded that the use of
   saponified animal and vegetable oil cannot improve the chemical quality
   of lamb meat.},

Abstract = {Primates are currently classified as ``Strepsirrhini{''} and
   ``Haplorrhini{''}. The strepsirrhines inhabit mainly Madagascar and
   Southeast Asia. However, the Haplorrhini are subdivided into ``old world
   monkeys{''} and ``new world monkeys{''}, the first being distributed in
   Africa and Asia mainly, while the main distribution areas for the latter
   are in Central and South America. They are frequent animals in zoos and
   rehabilitation centers, allowing abundant studies regarding their
   distribution, habitat, behavior and conservation measures, but few
   studies are related to their anatomy. For this reason, the aim of our
   study was to perform an anatomical description of the intrinsic muscles
   and cavity of the larynx in four specimens of primates, which were
   donated by the Metropolitan Park of Santiago, Chile, corresponding to
   species: spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps), capuchin monkey (Cebus
   albifrons), white-handed gibbon (Hvlobates lar) and ring-tailed lemur
   (Lemur catta). The dissection was performed from superficial to deep in
   each isolated larynx, describing and comparing the observed anatomical
   findings, using as a comparative guide the human anatomical literature.
   The study showed anatomical differences between the primates under
   study, as well as differences for what is described in the literature
   for the anatomy of the human larynx.},

Abstract = {It has been suggested that strepsirrhines (lemurs, lorises, and galagos)
   retain the more primitive left-hand preference, whilst monkeys and apes
   more regularly display a right-hand preference at the individual-level.
   We looked to address questions of laterality in the slow loris
   (Nycticebus spp.) using spontaneous observations of 7 wild individuals,
   unimanual tests in 6 captive individuals, and photos of 42 individuals
   in a bilateral posture assessing handedness at the individual- and
   group-level. During the unimanual reach task, we found at the
   individual-level, only 4 slow lorises showed a hand use bias (R: 3, L:
   1), Handedness index (HI) ranged from -0.57 to 1.00. In the wild
   unimanual grasp task, we found at the individual-level two individual
   showed a right-hand bias, the HI ranged from -0.19 to 0.70. The
   bilateral venom pose showed a trend toward a right-hand dominant grip in
   those photographed in captivity, but an ambiguous difference in wild
   individuals. There are many environmental constraints in captivity that
   wild animals do not face, thus data collected in wild settings are more
   representative of their natural state. The presence of right-handedness
   in these species suggests that there is a need to re-evaluate the
   evolution of handedness in primates.},

Abstract = {Anthropophilic mosquitoes are effective vectors of human disease because
   of their biting preferences. To find their host, these mosquitoes are
   guided by human odours, primarily produced by human skin bacteria. By
   analysing the skin bacterial and skin volatile profiles of humans,
   bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, lemurs and cows, we investigated whether
   primates that are more closely related to humans have a skin bacterial
   community and odour profile that is similar to that of humans. We then
   investigated whether this affected discrimination between humans and
   closely related primates by anthropophilic and zoophilic mosquitoes that
   search for hosts. Humans had a lower skin bacterial diversity than the
   other animals and their skin bacterial composition was more similar to
   that in other primates than it was to the skin bacteria of cows. Like
   the skin bacterial profiles, the volatile profiles of the animal groups
   were clearly different from each other. The volatile profiles of cows
   and lemurs were more closely related to the human profiles than
   expected. Human volatiles were indeed preferred above cow volatiles by
   anthropophilic mosquitoes and no preference was observed when tested
   against non-human primate odour, except for bonobo volatiles, which were
   preferred over human volatiles. Unravelling the differences between
   mosquito hosts and their effect on host selection is important for a
   better understanding of cross-species transmission of vector-borne
   diseases.},

Abstract = {The tremendous diversity of floral and fruit traits is, to a large
   extent, a set of adaptations that promote plant reproduction through
   animal pollinators and seed dispersers. Yet, it is still unknown whether
   fruit scent is a by-product of fruit maturation or an evolved
   communication channel with animal mutualists. We show that in species
   that specialize on seed dispersal by lemurs-an olfactorily oriented
   primate-fruits increase scent production and change their chemical
   composition significantly more than sympatric species whose seeds are
   largely dispersed by birds. We further show that lemurs use these shifts
   in fruit scent to identify ripe fruits. These results show that fruit
   scent is an evolved communication system that facilitates animal-plant
   mutualism.},

Abstract = {In this study, we characterize the diversity and estimated infection
   levels of gastrointestinal parasites circulating in two galago species,

   Gongylonema spp., Oesophagostomum spp., Lemuricola spp., Strongyloides
   spp. Trichostrongylus spp. and Trichuris spp.) and two protozoans
   (Balantidium spp. and Entamoeba spp.) may infect Galago spp. with high
   infection rates. The results show that a very similar parasite spectrum
   is found in both host species; all the taxa identified were previously
   observed in other Primate species and/or Man. They also show that age,
   gender and forest type may influence infection rates and/or parasite
   diversity found in a particular host and/or geographic area.},

   hypothesis that colour is an evolved signal to seed dispersers using a
   comparative community approach. We compared the contrast between ripe
   fruits and leaf backgrounds at two sites, one in Madagascar where seed
   dispersers are primarily night-active, red-green colour-blind lemurs,
   and the other in Uganda, where most vertebrate seed dispersers are
   day-active primates and birds with greater capacity for colour vision.
   We show that fruits in Uganda have higher contrast against leaf
   background in the red-green and luminance channels whereas fruits in
   Madagascar contrast more in the yellow-blue channel. These results
   indicate that fruit colour has evolved to contrast against background
   leaves in response to the visual capabilities of local seed disperser
   communities.},

Abstract = {Estimating the number of animals participating in a choral display may
   contribute reliable information on animal population estimates,
   particularly when environmental or behavioral factors restrict the
   possibility of visual surveys. Difficulties in providing a reliable
   estimate of the number of singers in a chorus are many (e.g., background
   noise masking, overlap). In this work, we contributed data on the vocal
   chorusing of the indri lemurs (Indri indri), which emit howling cries,
   known as songs, uttered by two to five individuals. We examined whether
   we could estimate the number of emitters in a chorus by screening the
   fundamental frequency in the spectrograms and the total duration of the
   songs, and the reliability of those methods when compared to the real
   chorus size. The spectrographic investigation appears to provide
   reliable information on the number of animals participating in the
   chorusing only when this number is limited to two or three singers. We
   also found that the Acoustic Complexity Index positively correlated with
   the real chorus size, showing that an automated analysis of the chorus
   may provide information about the number of singers. We can state that
   song duration shows a correlation with the number of emitters but also
   shows a remarkable variation that remains unexplained. The accuracy of
   the estimates can reflect the high variability in chorus size, which
   could be affected by group composition, season and context. In future
   research, a greater focus on analyzing frequency change occurring during
   these collective vocal displays should improve our ability to detect
   individuals and allow a finer tuning of the acoustic methods that may
   serve for monitoring chorusing mammals.},

Title = {The inside tract: The appendicular, cecal, and colonic microbiome of
   captive aye-ayes},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {166},
Number = {4},
Pages = {960-967},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {ObjectivesThe aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) is famous for its
   feeding strategies that target structurally defended, but high-quality
   resources. Nonetheless, the influence of this digestible diet on gut
   microbial contributions to aye-aye metabolism and nutrition remains
   unexplored. When four captive aye-ayes were unexpectedly lost to persin
   toxicity, we opportunistically collected samples along the animals'
   gastrointestinal tracts. Here we describe the diversity and composition
   of appendicular, cecal, and colonic consortia relative to the aye-aye's
   unusual feeding ecology.
   Materials and methodsDuring necropsies, we collected digestive content
   from the appendix, cecum, and distal colon. We determined microbiome
   structure at these sites via amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene
   and an established bioinformatics pipeline.
   ResultsThe aye-ayes' microbiomes exhibited low richness and diversity
   compared to the consortia of other lemurs housed at the same facility,
   and were dominated by a single genus, Prevotella. Appendicular
   microbiomes were differentiated from more homogenized cecal and colonic
   consortia by lower richness and diversity, greater evenness, and a
   distinct taxonomic composition.
   DiscussionThe simplicity of the aye-aye's gut microbiome could be
   attributed to captivity-induced dysbiosis, or it may reflect this
   species' extreme foraging investment in a digestible diet that requires
   little microbial metabolism. Site-specific appendicular consortia, but
   more similar cecal and colonic consortia, support the theory that the
   appendix functions as a safe-house for beneficial bacteria, and confirm
   fecal communities as fairly reliable proxies for consortia along the
   lower gut. We encourage others to make similar use of natural or
   accidental losses for probing the primate gut microbiome.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Convergence-the independent evolution of similar phenotypes in distantly
   related clades-is a widespread and much-studied phenomenon. An
   often-cited, but hitherto untested, case of morphological convergence is
   that between the aye-aye and squirrels. The aye-aye (Daubentonia
   madagascariensis) is a highly unusual lemuriform primate that has
   evolved a dentition similar to that of rodents: it possesses large,
   ever-growing incisors which it uses to strip the bark from trees in
   order to feed on wood-boring beetle larvae. Indeed, such is the
   similarity that some of the earliest classifications of the aye-aye
   placed it in the squirrel genus Sciurus. Here, we aimed to test the
   degree of convergence between the skulls and lower jaws of squirrels and
   the aye-aye. Three-dimensional landmarks were recorded from the crania
   and mandibles of 46 taxa representing the majority of families in the
   Euarchontoglires. Results were plotted as phylomorphospaces and
   convergence measures were calculated. The convergence between squirrels
   and the aye-aye was shown to be statistically significant for both the
   cranium and mandible, although the mandibles seem to converge more
   closely in shape. The convergence may indicate strong functional drivers
   of morphology in these taxa, i.e. the use of the incisors to produce
   high bite forces during feeding. Overall, we have shown that this
   classic case of convergence stands up to quantitative analysis.},

Abstract = {Madagascar is one of the most threatened biodiversity hotspots, and
   protection of its biodiversity is becoming increasingly urgent as
   deforestation of the island continues. For the long-term success of
   conservation efforts it is essential that key ecological processes, such
   as seed dispersal, are protected and restored. Therefore, the
   identification of ecological gaps is a vital task. For Madagascar, only
   little is known about plant-animal interactions, and traditional methods
   of ecological research are too time-consuming to provide crucial
   information about breakdowns in these interactions. To identify likely
   dispersal gaps we therefore used a theoretical approach to analyse
   plant-disperser interactions in Madagascar. We used data science tools
   to impute missing data on relevant plant traits to subsequently predict
   the most likely dispersal agents for each of Madagascar's endemic plant
   species. We found that 38\% of the endemic species (N = 8,784) are
   endozoochorous, and among these 26-41\% display a primate syndrome and
   17-19\% a bird syndrome (depending on the definition of syndromes). This
   lower percentage of endozoochorous species and higher percentage of
   species with a primate syndrome in Madagascar compared to other tropical
   areas reflects the unusual disperser guild on the island. Only five bird
   species but.. lemur species are frugivorous, and.. of those lemur
   species are currently threatened with extinction. The disappearance of
   frugivorous lemurs would significantly change the vegetation dynamics of
   Madagascar's ecosystems, and a high proportion of Madagascar's endemic
   plants would enter an extinction vortex.},

Abstract = {Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), a small, secreted protein, is
   critical for fetal and prenatal growth in humans and other mammals. The
   IGF2 gene and its mouse homolog comprise part of a conserved linkage
   group that is regulated by parental imprinting, with IGF2/Igf2 being
   expressed from the paternal chromosome, and the adjacent H19 gene from
   the maternal chromosome. By using information extracted from public
   genomic and gene expression databases. I have now analyzed this locus in
   nine nonhuman primate species representing over 60 million years of
   evolutionary divergence from a common progenitor. Both IGF2 and H19
   genes and the entire locus have been conserved among these primates.
   Each primate IGF2 gene except for gibbon and marmoset is composed of 10
   exons and contains five potential promoters, each with distinctive
   5'-untranslated exons. Similarly. except for marmoset and mouse lemur,
   H19 consists of six exons and has two promoters. DNA sequence
   conservation is high, not only in orthologous exons and promoters. but
   also in a putative imprinting control region located 5' to H19 and in
   multiple potential distal enhancer elements found 3' to H19.
   Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that common
   regulatory processes shaped the IGF2 - H19 locus before the onset of
   primate speciation more than 85 million years ago. This study also leads
   to the conclusion that inaccuracies in data presentation in genetic
   repositories could limit our ability to develop novel insights about
   roles of individual genes and multigene loci in mammalian physiology and
   disease.},

Title = {Intra-specific variation in social organization of Strepsirrhines},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {80},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Strepsirrhines, that is, lemurs, galagos, and lorises, are considered
   basal primates, making them important to understand the evolution of
   primate sociality. Apart from some lemurs, they are nocturnal and
   solitary living, though the view of their sociality nature has changed
   with field studies being completed. We conducted a review of the primary
   literature about the social organization (group composition) of
   strepsirrhines, with the aim to determine whether intra-specific
   variation in social organization (IVSO) occurs and to determine how many
   species are pair-living, group-living, or solitary living. We found data
   in 83 peer-reviewed studies for 43 of the 132 strepsirrhine species and
   compared our results using two databases on social systems of mammals
   published in 2011 and 2013. While it is often assumed that primates show
   relatively fixed social organizations, we found that 60.5\% of species
   for which data exist have IVSO. Wefound only 7\% of the species to be
   truly solitary living (with 34.9\% additional species to be sometimes
   solitary living), which is in contrast to the other databases, which had
   reported 60.9\% and 37.7\% of species to be solitary. We further
   explored group compositions by designating ``functional groups{''}
   (e.g., foraging, breeding, and infant care groups). While functional
   groups might explain IVSO within a single species, this was not
   consistent over species with IVSO, such that IVSO was poorly explained
   by functional groups. Our study supports the view that most
   strepsirrhines are social (58.1\% of species with another 34.9\% of
   species sometimes living in pairs or groups) and show complex and often
   variable social organizations; reinforcing the assumption that the
   ancestor of all primates was social and not solitary.},

   breast cancer: a docking, dynamics, and MM/PBSA approach},
Journal = {3 BIOTECH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {5},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Human lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3) is primarily involved in
   regulation of estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha) by phosphorylation
   activity. LMTK3 acts as key biomarker for ERa positive breast cancer and
   identified as novel drug target for breast cancer. Due to the absence of
   experimental reports, the computational approach has been followed to
   screen LMTK3 inhibitors from natural product curcumin derivatives based
   on rational inhibitor design. The initial virtual screening and
   re-docking resulted in identification of top three leads with favorable
   binding energy and strong interactions in critical residues of
   ATP-binding cavity. ADME prediction confirmed the pharmacological
   activity of the leads with various properties. The stability and binding
   affinity of leads were well refined in dynamic system from 25 ns MD
   simulations. The behavior of protein motion towards closure of
   ATP-binding cavity was evaluated based on eigenvectors by PCA. In
   addition, MM/PBSA calculations also confirmed the relative binding free
   energy of LMTK3-lead complexes in favor of the effective binding. From
   our study, novel LMTK3 inhibitors tetrahydrocurcumin, curcumin
   4,4'-diacetate, and demethoxycurcumin have been proposed with inhibition
   mechanism. Further experimental evaluation on reported lead candidates
   might prove its role in breast cancer therapeutics.},

Title = {Genetic variation and selection of MHC class I loci differ in two
   congeneric frogs},
Journal = {GENETICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {146},
Number = {2},
Pages = {125-136},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes encode proteins in the
   acquired immune response pathway that often show distinctive
   selection-driven patterns in wild vertebrate populations. We examined
   genetic variation and signatures of selection in the MHC class I alpha 1
   (A1)- and alpha 2 (A2)-domain encoding exons of two frog congeners
   {[}Agalychnis callidryas (n = 20) and A. lemur (n = 20)] from a single
   locality in Panama. We also investigated how historical demographic
   processes may have impacted MHC genetic diversity by analyzing a neutral
   mitochondrial marker. We found that both MHC domains were highly
   variable in both species, with both species likely expressing three
   loci. Our analyses revealed different signatures of selection between
   the two species, most notably that the A. callidryas A2 domain had
   experienced positive selection while the A2 domain of A. lemur had not.
   Diversifying selection acted on the same number of A1 and A2 allelic
   lineages, but on a higher percentage of A1 sites compared to A2 sites.
   Neutrality tests of mitochondrial haplotypes predominately indicated
   that the two species were at genetic equilibrium when the samples were
   collected. In addition, two historical tests of demography indicated
   both species have had relatively stable population sizes over the past
   100,000 years; thus large population size changes are unlikely to have
   greatly influenced MHC diversity in either species during this time
   period. In conclusion, our results suggest that the impact of selection
   on MHC diversity varied between these two closely related species,
   likely due to a combination of distinct ecological conditions and past
   pathogenic pressures.},

   Madagascar-Towards Forest Restoration},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Berenty Reserve, a fully protected gallery forest beside the Mandrare
   River is renowned for its lemurs, but the continuous canopy of the main
   forest is shrinking, fragmenting and degrading. The aim of this study,
   before any restoration can be considered, is to investigate why
   canopy-cover is declining and define the forest's vegetation status and
   composition. Our study includes analysis of tamarind age (the dominant
   species) and regeneration, forest extent, climate and soil. Measurement
   of trunk circumference and annual rings indicated a median age of 190
   years, near the accepted maximum for tamarinds. There is no regeneration
   of tamarind seedlings under the canopy and an invasive vine, Cissus
   quadrangularis suffocates any regeneration on the forest margins. A
   vegetation survey, based on fifteen transects, broadly characterized
   three forest areas: continuous canopy near the river, transitional
   canopy with fewer tall trees, and degraded dryland; the survey also
   provided a list of the 18 most common tree species. Ring counts of
   flood-damaged roots combined with measurement to the riverbank show that
   erosion rates, up to 19.5 cm/year, are not an immediate threat to forest
   extent. The highly variable climate shows no trend and analysis of
   forest soil indicates compatibility with plant growth.},

Abstract = {Mammalian skeletal muscle is influenced by the functional demands placed
   upon it. Functional morphology of facial expression musculature, or
   mimetic musculature, is largely unknown. Recently, primate mimetic
   musculature has been shown to respond to demands associated with social
   factors. Body size has also been demonstrated to affect many aspects of
   primate functional morphology and evolutionary morphology. The present
   study was designed to further examine the role of social variables and
   body size in influencing the morphology of primate mimetic musculature
   using a broad phylogenetic range of primates, primates with varying body
   sizes, and those that exploit differing time of day activity cycles and
   social group sizes. Gross data on mimetic musculature morphology were
   gathered from tarsiers (Tarsius bancanus), slender lorises (Loris
   tardigradus), ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta), crowned lemurs (Eulemur
   coronatus), black lemurs (E. macaco), owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus),
   and howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya) and compared to previous results
   from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), gibbons and siamangs (hylobatids),
   rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), Sulawesi macaques (M. nigra), common
   marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), and greater bushbabies (Otolemur spp.).
   Mimetic muscle presence/absence was observed and recorded. Results
   revealed that phylogenetic position determines the overall mimetic
   muscle groundplan, with anthropoids having a high number of muscles in
   the superciliary and midface regions, strepsirrhines having a high
   number of muscles in the external ear region, and tarsiers displaying an
   intermediate condition. Within these broad taxonomic categories body
   size had an effect on mimetic musculature, while time of day activity
   and social group size had smaller effects. (C) 2018 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {Despite great interest and decades of research, the musculoskeletal
   relationships of the masticatory system in primates are still not fully
   understood. However, without a clear understanding of the interplay
   between muscles and bones it remains difficult to understand the
   functional significance of morphological traits of the skeleton. Here,
   we aim to study the impacts of the masticatory muscles on the shape of
   the cranium and the mandible as well as their co-variation in
   strepsirrhine primates. To do so, we use 3D geometric morphometric
   approaches to assess the shape of each bone of the skull of 20 species
   for which muscle data are available in the literature. Impacts of the
   masticatory muscles on the skull shape were assessed using
   non-phylogenetic regressions and phylogenetic regressions whereas
   co-variations were assessed using two-blocks partial least square
   (2B-PLS) and phylogenetic 2B-PLS. Our results show that there is a
   phylogenetic signal for skull shape and masticatory muscles. They also
   show that there is a significant impact of the masticatory muscles on
   cranial shape but not as much as on the mandible. The co-variations are
   also stronger between the masticatory muscles and cranial shape even
   when taking into account phylogeny. Interestingly, the results of
   co-variation between the masticatory muscles and mandibular shape show a
   more complex pattern in two different directions to get strong muscles
   associated with mandibular shape: a folivore way (with the bamboo lemurs
   and sifakas) and a hard-object eater one (with the aye-aye). (C) 2018

Abstract = {An integrated taxonomic approach, combining both morphological and
   molecular data, was adopted to investigate the Hydrolagus
   lemures-ogilbyi group in the Indo-Australian region. Single
   mitochondrial markers (CO1 and NADH2) provided evidence supporting the
   separation of four distinct species in this group. However, detailed
   morphological data collected from specimens from across their range
   failed to find any consistent differences, and many features previously
   considered to be diagnostic were found to be variable. Nuclear DNA data
   also failed to support the differences found with the single
   mitochondrial markers and, together with the morphological data,
   supported the hypothesis that only a single species in this group is
   present in the Indo-Australian region. In addition, the results failed
   to support the current generic placement of this group in Hydrolagus,
   suggesting they belong to the genus Chimaera with doubt over the
   validity of Hydrolagus as a valid genus. The oldest available name for
   this group is Chimaera ogilbyi and a redescription is provided. This
   species occurs throughout Australia, eastern Indonesia (Java, Bali, and
   Lombok) and northern Papua New Guinea.},

Title = {Isolation and characterization of olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells
   from eight mammalian genera},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JAN 17},
Abstract = {Background: Stem cell-based therapies are an attractive option to
   promote regeneration and repair defective tissues and organs. Thanks to
   their multipotency, high proliferation rate and the lack of major
   ethical limitations, ``olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells{''}
   (OE-MSCs) have been described as a promising candidate to treat a
   variety of damaged tissues. Easily accessible in the nasal cavity of
   most mammals, these cells are highly suitable for autologous cell-based
   therapies and do not face issues associated with other stem cells.
   However, their clinical use in humans and animals is limited due to a
   lack of preclinical studies on autologous transplantation and because no
   well-established methods currently exist to cultivate these cells. Here
   we evaluated the feasibility of collecting, purifying and amplifying
   OE-MSCs from different mammalian genera with the goal of promoting their
   interest in veterinary regenerative medicine. Biopsies of olfactory
   mucosa from eight mammalian genera (mouse, rat, rabbit, sheep, dog,
   horse, gray mouse lemur and macaque) were collected, using techniques
   derived from those previously used in humans and rats. The possibility
   of amplifying these cells and their stemness features and
   differentiation capability were then evaluated.
   Results: Biopsies were successfully performed on olfactory mucosa
   without requiring the sacrifice of the donor animal, except mice. Cell
   populations were rapidly generated from olfactory mucosa explants. These
   cells displayed similar key features of their human counterparts: a
   fibroblastic morphology, a robust expression of nestin, an ability to
   form spheres and similar expression of surface markers (CD44, CD73).
   Moreover, most of them also exhibited high proliferation rates and
   clonogenicity with genus-specific properties. Finally, OE-MSCs also
   showed the ability to differentiate into mesodermal lineages.
   Conclusions: This article describes for the first time how millions of
   OE-MSCs can be quickly and easily obtained from different mammalian
   genera through protocols that are well-suited for autologous
   transplantations. Moreover, their multipotency makes them relevant to
   evaluate therapeutic application in a wide variety of tissue injury
   models. This study paves the way for the development of new fundamental
   and clinical studies based on OE-MSCs transplantation and suggests their
   interest in veterinary medicine.},

Title = {In Vitro Evaluation of an Injectable EEG/ECG Sensor for Wireless
   Monitoring of Hibernation in Endangered Animal Species},
Journal = {IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Hibernation is a unique metabolic adaptation employed by several animal
   species for survival where its study would further enhance our
   understanding of metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and obesity. As a
   primate animal with close genetic ties to humans, the recent discovery
   of hibernation in dwarf lemurs of Madagascar has attracted the attention
   of researchers. Traditional recording systems require the physical
   tethering of the animals to the recording apparatus or the use of
   implantable devices. Scalp and needle electrodes interfere with the
   natural hibernation process and limit the continuity of the experiments,
   while invasive procedures are banned on endangered species. By
   integrating a full-wave rectifier, low-noise signal conditioning
   circuit, frequency modulation transmitter, and antenna in a single
   application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), we have developed an
   ultra-miniaturized wireless system that measures 34 x 4 x 2.6 mm(3) in
   volume. It only requires three off-chip components (a coil wound around
   a ferrite rod and two external capacitors) to be powered wirelessly
   through a 1-MHz inductive link, such that it can be packaged inside a
   glass or polymer capsule and injected subcutaneously underneath the
   scalp or chest without requiring a surgery, thereby addressing the
   shortcomings of the traditional monitoring systems. Our recording device
   provides an input/output correlation coefficient greater than 80\% for
   input amplitudes ranging from 60 to 260 mu V-pp, with a wireless data
   transmission range of similar to 2.5 cm while operating near the 902-928
   MHz ISM frequency band. This system would enable future studies of
   electroencephalography and electrocardiography in hibernating dwarf
   lemurs. The ASIC was fabricated using the ON Semiconductor 0.5-mu m CMOS
   process with an active area of 2.5 x 1 mm(2) and has a power consumption
   of 7.75 mW from a 3.1 V supply. In this paper, we demonstrate the in
   vitro functionality of the system using simulated physiological signals
   directly applied to the ASIC or through standard stainless steel
   electrodes immersed in saline solution.},

Title = {Scaling of bony canals for encephalic vessels in euarchontans:
   Implications for the role of the vertebral artery and brain metabolism},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {85-101},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Supplying the central nervous system with oxygen and glucose for
   metabolic activities is a critical function for all animals at
   physiologic, anatomical, and behavioral levels. A relatively proximate
   challenge to nourishing the brain is maintaining adequate blood flow.
   Euarchontans (primates, dermopterans and treeshrews) display a diversity
   of solutions to this challenge. Although the vertebral artery is a major
   encephalic vessel, previous research has questioned its importance for
   irrigating the cerebrum. This presents a puzzling scenario for certain
   strepsirrhine primates (non-cheirogaleid lemuriforms) that have reduced
   promontorial branches of the internal carotid artery and no apparent
   alternative encephalic vascular route except for the vertebral artery.
   Here, we present results of phylogenetic comparative analyses of data on
   the cross-sectional area of bony canals that transmit the vertebral
   artery (transverse foramina). These results show that, across primates
   (and within major primate subgroups), variation in the transverse
   foramina helps significantly to explain variation in forebrain mass even
   when variation in promontorial canal cross-sectional areas are also
   considered. Furthermore, non-cheirogaleid lemuriforms have larger
   transverse foramina for their endocranial volume than other
   euarchontans, suggesting that the vertebral arteries compensate for
   reduced promontorial artery size. We also find that, among internal
   carotid-reliant euarchontans, species that are more encephalized tend to
   have a promontorial canal that is larger relative to the transverse
   foramina. Tentatively, we consider the correlation between arterial
   canal diameters (as a proxy for blood flow) and brain metabolic demands.
   The results of this analysis imply that human investment in brain
   metabolism (similar to 27\% of basal metabolic rate) may not be
   exceptional among euarchontans. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL WELFARE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {185-199},
Abstract = {The 2011 European Union Zoo Inquiry presented evidence that most zoos
   fail to achieve adequate levels of nonhuman animal welfare. Appropriate
   environmental enrichment (EE) can play a role in the promotion of
   welfare. However, financial and staff constraints frequently make it
   challenging to implement EE on a daily basis. The aim of this study was
   to test how individuals of three different nonhuman primate species at
   the Maia Zoo in Portugal (white-handed gibbons, Hylobates lar; Mona
   monkeys, Cercopithecus mona; and brown lemurs, Eulemur fulvus) reacted
   to EE devices. Another aim was to investigate whether simple,
   inexpensive devices can have positive outcomes for animal welfare. The
   results showed that all individuals reacted to the EE intervention, but
   individual responses to the EE devices differed. EE devices had
   consistently positive effects for all three species as demonstrated by
   an increase in the expression of natural behaviors and a general
   decrease in abnormal behaviors (46\% compared with baseline). This study
   demonstrates that it is important to simultaneously test multiple
   individuals from different species in different situations to evaluate
   the effectiveness of EE.},

Title = {Unusual cases of Taenia crassiceps cysticercosis in naturally infected
   animals in the Czech Republic},
Journal = {VETERINARNI MEDICINA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {63},
Number = {2},
Pages = {73-80},
Abstract = {The tapeworm Taenia crassiceps has an indirect life cycle. Occasionally,
   metacestode stages have been reported from aberrant hosts as dogs, cats,
   lemurs and humans. This study describes an unusual series of serious
   cysticercosis cases: an 18-month-old male Yorkshire terrier dog with
   pleural cysticercosis accompanied by a cough, a 10-year-old male Shih
   Tzu dog with subcutaneous cysticercosis as well as a Cape ground
   squirrel and a Senegal bushbaby, both with generalised cysticercosis.
   Surgery was successful only in the Shih Tzu. The Yorkshire terrier died
   a few hours after surgery, while the Cape ground squirrel was euthanised
   and the Senegal bushbaby died before surgery. Cysticerci from the four
   cases were identified morphologically and using molecular methods.
   Fragments of genes coding for cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 were
   sequenced for each of the four isolates. Their affiliation to T.
   crassiceps was confirmed by comparison with the sequence data of other
   isolates available in the GenBank database. In general, the comparison
   of sequences of all isolates showed low variability in nucleotide
   composition (at most five positions). The cases from captive zoo animals
   represent the first findings of T. crassiceps in the Cape ground
   squirrel and Senegal bushbaby. The optimal treatment of cysticercosis
   caused by T. crassiceps remains unclear. Successful attempts usually
   include extensive surgical interventions and prolonged anthelmintic
   treatment. Chemotherapeutic options are limited. Although regular
   deworming targeting intestinal helminths of dogs is not effective
   against T. crassiceps cysticerci, it may help to prevent contamination
   of the environment by tapeworm eggs contained in dog faeces and reduce
   the risk of infection for susceptible animals and humans.},

Title = {Mycobacterium leprae genomes from naturally infected nonhuman primates},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Leprosy is caused by the bacterial pathogens Mycobacterium leprae and
   Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Apart from humans, animals such as
   nine-banded armadillos in the Americas and red squirrels in the British
   Isles are naturally infected with M. leprae. Natural leprosy has also
   been reported in certain nonhuman primates, but it is not known whether
   these occurrences are due to incidental infections by human M. leprae
   strains or by M. leprae strains specific to nonhuman primates. In this
   study, complete M. leprae genomes from three naturally infected nonhuman
   primates (a chimpanzee from Sierra Leone, a sooty mangabey from West
   Africa, and a cynomolgus macaque from The Philippines) were sequenced.
   Phylogenetic analyses showed that the cynomolgus macaque M. leprae
   strain is most closely related to a human M. leprae strain from New
   Caledonia, whereas the chimpanzee and sooty mangabey M. leprae strains
   belong to a human M. leprae lineage commonly found in West Africa.
   Additionally, samples from ring-tailed lemurs from the Beza Mahafaly
   Special Reserve, Madagascar, and chimpanzees from Ngogo, Kibale National
   Park, Uganda, were screened using quantitative PCR assays, to assess the
   prevalence of M. leprae in wild nonhuman primates. However, these
   samples did not show evidence of M. leprae infection. Overall, this
   study adds genomic data for nonhuman primate M. leprae strains to the
   existing M. leprae literature and finds that this pathogen can be
   transmitted from humans to nonhuman primates as well as between nonhuman
   primate species. While the prevalence of natural leprosy in nonhuman
   primates is likely low, nevertheless, future studies should continue to
   explore the prevalence of leprosy-causing pathogens in the wild.},

Abstract = {This study aims to determine the effect of roasting temperature on the
   chemical quality of silverside Simental Ongole Crossbred male meat. All
   cows were fed soybean groats meal and lemuru fish oil protected. This
   study used a silver side Simental Ongole crossbred meat taken from Bicep
   femoris muscle. Cattle fattened with feedlot system for 90 days. Cattle
   slaughtering and preparation of carcasses using the method carried out
   in the abattoir. The roasted samples weigh 150 g and wrapped with
   aluminium foil. Meat is roasted at 125 degrees C and 145 degrees C for
   30 minutes. This experiment was conducted in an experimental way using a
   complete randomized design. Treatment as follows: T0 (unroasted meat),
   T125 (roasted meat temperature of 125 degrees C) and T145 (roasted meat
   temperature of 145 degrees C). Test Tukey test to know the difference
   between treatments. The results of variance analysis showed that
   roasting affects water content, protein content, and fat content (P <
   0.01) but did not affect cholesterol content. Conclusions from this
   research are roasting at a temperature of 145 degrees C can lower water
   levels with a mean 72.37 into 70.66\%. The roasting of 125 degrees C and
   145 degrees C can increase the protein content by 21,56 to 24,62\% and
   decrease the fat content 3,80 to 2,21\%.},

Abstract = {Integration of the sphenoid and ethmoid bones during early postnatal
   development is poorly described in the literature. A uniquely prolonged
   patency of sphenoethmoidal synchondrosis or prespheno-septal
   synchondrosis (PSept) has been attributed to humans. However, the
   sphenoethmoidal junction has not been studied using a comparative
   primate sample. Here, we examined development of the sphenoethmoidal
   interface using ontogenetic samples of Old and New World monkeys,
   strepsirrhine primates (lemurs and lorises), and a comparative sample of
   other mammals. Specimens ranging from late fetal to 1month postnatal age
   were studied using histology, immunohistochemistry, and micro-computed
   tomography methods. Our results demonstrate that humans are not unique
   in anterior cranial base growth at PSept, as it is patent in all newborn
   primates. We found two distinctions within our sample. First, nearly all
   primates exhibit an earlier breakdown of the nasal capsule cartilage
   that abuts the orbitosphenoid when compared to nonprimates. This may
   facilitate earlier postnatal integration of the basicranium and midface
   and may enhance morphological plasticity in the region. Second, the
   PSept exhibits a basic dichotomy between strepsirrhines and monkeys. In
   strepsirrhines, the PSept has proliferating chondrocytes that are
   primarily oriented in a longitudinal plane, as in other mammals. In
   contrast, monkeys have a convex anterior end of the presphenoid with a
   radial boundary of cartilaginous growth at PSept. Our findings suggest
   that the PSept acts as a pacemaker of longitudinal facial growth in
   mammals with relatively long snouts, but may also contribute to facial
   height and produce a relatively taller midface in anthropoid primates.

Title = {Reading wild minds: A computational assay of Theory of Mind
   sophistication across seven primate species},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {13},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Theory of Mind (ToM), i.e. the ability to understand others' mental
   states, endows humans with highly adaptive social skills such as
   teaching or deceiving. Candidate evolutionary explanations have been
   proposed for the unique sophistication of human ToM among primates. For
   example, the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis states that the
   increasing complexity of social networks may have induced a demand for
   sophisticated ToM. This type of scenario ignores neurocognitive
   constraints that may eventually be crucial limiting factors for ToM
   evolution. In contradistinction, the cognitive scaffolding hypothesis
   asserts that a species' opportunity to develop sophisticated ToM is
   mostly determined by its general cognitive capacity (on which ToM is
   scaffolded). However, the actual relationships between ToM
   sophistication and either brain volume (a proxy for general cognitive
   capacity) or social group size (a proxy for social network complexity)
   are unclear. Here, we let 39 individuals sampled from seven non-human
   primate species (lemurs, macaques, mangabeys, orangutans, gorillas and
   chimpanzees) engage in simple dyadic games against artificial ToM
   players (via a familiar human caregiver). Using computational analyses
   of primates' choice sequences, we found that the probability of
   exhibiting a ToM-compatible learning style is mainly driven by species'
   brain volume (rather than by social group size). Moreover, primates'
   social cognitive sophistication culminates in a precursor form of ToM,
   which still falls short of human fully-developed ToM abilities.},

   tropical regions-high in the New World, low in Madagascar and
   intermediate in Africa and Asia-represents a long-standing enigma in
   ecology. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these
   differences but the ultimate drivers remain unclear. Here, we tested the
   hypothesis that fruits in Madagascar contain insufficient nitrogen to
   meet primate metabolic requirements, thus constraining the evolution of
   frugivory. We performed a global analysis of nitrogen in fruits consumed
   by primates, as collated from 79 studies. Our results showed that
   average frugivory among lemur communities was lower compared to New
   World and Asian-African primate communities. Fruits in Madagascar
   contain lower average nitrogen than those in the New World and Old
   World. Nitrogen content in the overall diets of primate species did not
   differ},

Abstract = {Short tandem repeat (STR) variants are highly polymorphic markers that
   facilitate powerful population genetic analyses. STRs are especially
   valuable in conservation and ecological genetic research, yielding
   detailed information on population structure and short-term demographic
   fluctuations. Massively parallel sequencing has not previously been
   leveraged for scalable, efficient STR recovery. Here, we present a
   pipeline for developing STR markers directly from high-throughput
   shotgun sequencing data without a reference genome, and an approach for
   highly parallel target STR recovery. We employed our approach to capture
   a panel of 5000 STRs from a test group of diademed sifakas (Propithecus
   diadema, n = 3), endangered Malagasy rainforest lemurs, and we report
   extremely efficient recovery of targeted loci--97.3-99.6\% of STRs
   characterized with >= 10x non-redundant sequence coverage. We then
   tested our STR capture strategy on P. diadema fecal DNA, and report
   robust initial results and suggestions for future implementations. In
   addition to STR targets, this approach also generates large, genomewide
   single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels from flanking regions. Our
   method provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for rapid
   recovery of large STR and SNP datasets in any species without needing a
   reference genome, and can be used even with suboptimal DNA more easily
   acquired in conservation and ecological studies.},

Title = {The evolution of vertical climbing in primates: evidence from reaction

Abstract = {Vertical climbing is an essential behavior for arboreal animals, yet
   limb mechanics during climbing are poorly understood and rarely compared
   with those observed during horizontal walking. Primates commonly engage
   in both arboreal walking and vertical climbing, and this makes them an
   ideal taxa in which to compare these locomotor forms. Additionally,
   primates exhibit unusual limb mechanics compared with most other
   quadrupeds, with weight distribution biased towards the hindlimbs, a
   pattern that is argued to have evolved in response to the challenges of
   arboreal walking. Here we test an alternative hypothesis that functional
   differentiation between the limbs evolved initially as a response to
   climbing. Eight primate species were recorded locomoting on instrumented
   vertical and horizontal simulated arboreal runways. Forces along the
   axis of, and normal to, the support were recorded. During walking, all
   primates displayed forelimbs that were net braking, and hindlimbs that
   were net propulsive. In contrast, both limbs served a propulsive role
   during climbing. In all species, except the lorisids, the hindlimbs
   produced greater propulsive forces than the forelimbs during climbing.
   During climbing, the hindlimbs tends to support compressive loads, while
   the forelimb forces tend to be primarily tensile. This functional
   disparity appears to be body-size dependent. The tensile loading of the
   forelimbs versus the compressive loading of the hindlimbs observed
   during climbing may have important evolutionary implications for
   primates, and it may be the case that hindlimb-biased weight support
   exhibited during quadrupedal walking in primates may be derived from
   their basal condition of climbing thin branches.},

Volume = {47},
Number = {3},
Pages = {685-697},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Here, we report on a comprehensive collection of mainly early life
   cephalopods that were sampled during a research cruise to the Sargasso
   Sea with the RV Maria S. Merian in April 2015. A total of 2466
   cephalopods were caught which belonged to at least 27 species (17
   families). The most abundant family was represented by the hooked squids
   (Onychoteuthidae) with a share of 19.18\% of the total cephalopod catch.
   The subtropical convergence zone (STCZ) was found approximately around
   27 A degrees N. The STCZ was characterised by a sharp near-surface
   temperature gradient and divided the Sargasso Sea into a northern and a
   southern area. This division was also reflected in the cephalopod
   community composition. For example, the cranchiid Leachia lemur
   prevailed in the northern part, and the incirrate octopod, Japetella
   diaphana, was mainly distributed in the southern part of the study area.
   Principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA)
   analyses detected a significant correlation between species occurrence
   and sea surface temperature (SST) as well as a longitudinal gradient
   with distinct clusters along the five transects from west to east.
   Ordination analysis (MDS) showed significant differences in the
   cephalopod assemblages between day and night with midwater forms
   (Enoploteuthidae, Pyroteuthidae) dominating the night catches, probably
   due to their upward migration into the top 200 m during the night.},

Title = {An intra-population analysis of the indris' song dissimilarity in the
   light of genetic distance},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 31},
Abstract = {The increasing interest in the evolution of human language has led
   several fields of research to focus on primate vocal communication. The
   `singing primates', which produce elaborated and complex sequences of
   vocalizations, are of particular interest for this topic. Indris (Indri
   indri) are the only singing lemurs and emit songs whose most distinctive
   portions are ``descending phrases{''} consisting of 2-5 units. We
   examined how the structure of the indris' phrases varied with genetic
   relatedness among individuals. We tested whether the acoustic structure
   could provide conspecifics with information about individual identity
   and group membership. When analyzing phrase dissimilarity and genetic
   distance of both sexes, we found significant results for males but not
   for females. We found that similarity of male song-phrases correlates
   with kin in both time and frequency parameters, while, for females, this
   information is encoded only in the frequency of a single type. Song
   phrases have consistent individual-specific features, but we did not
   find any potential for advertising group membership. We emphasize the
   fact that genetic and social factors may play a role in the acoustic
   plasticity of female indris. Altogether, these findings open a new
   perspective for future research on the possibility of vocal production
   learning in these primates.},

Abstract = {The timing of the diversification of placental mammals relative to the
   Cretaceous-Paleogene (KPg) boundary mass extinction remains highly
   controversial. In particular, there have been seemingly irreconcilable
   differences in the dating of the early placental radiation not only
   between fossil-based and molecular datasets but also among molecular
   datasets. To help resolve this discrepancy, we performed genome-scale
   analyses using 4,388 loci from 90 taxa, including representatives of all
   extant placental orders and transcriptome data from flying lemurs
   (Dermoptera) and pangolins (Pholidota). Depending on the gene
   partitioning scheme, molecular clock model, and genic deviation from
   molecular clock assumptions, extensive sensitivity analyses recovered
   widely varying diversification scenarios for placental mammals from a
   given gene set, ranging from a deep Cretaceous origin and
   diversification to a scenario spanning the KPg boundary, suggesting that
   the use of suboptimal molecular clock markers and methodologies is a
   major cause of controversies regarding placental diversification timing.
   We demonstrate that reconciliation between molecular and paleontological
   estimates of placental divergence times can be achieved using the
   appropriate clock model and gene partitioning scheme while accounting
   for the degree to which individual genes violate molecular clock
   assumptions. A birth-death-shift analysis suggests that placental
   mammals underwent a continuous radiation across the KPg boundary without
   apparent interruption by the mass extinction, paralleling a genus-level
   radiation of multituberculates and ecomorphological diversification of
   both multituberculates and therians. These findings suggest that the KPg
   catastrophe evidently played a limited role in placental
   diversification, which, instead, was likely a delayed response to the
   slightly earlier radiation of angiosperms.},

Abstract = {Understanding the extent to which primates in forest fragments can
   adjust behaviorally and ecologically to changes caused by deforestation
   is essential to designing conservation management plans. During a
   12-month period, we studied the effects of habitat loss and degradation
   on the Ethiopian endemic, bamboo specialist, Bale monkey (Chlorocebus
   djamdjamensis) by comparing its habitat quality, activity budget,
   ranging ecology and habitat use in continuous forest and two fragments.
   We found that habitat loss and fragmentation resulted in major
   differences in vegetation composition and structure between forest
   types. We also found that Bale monkeys in continuous forest spent more
   time feeding and traveling and less time resting and socializing than
   monkeys in fragments. Bale monkeys in continuous forest also had higher
   movement rates (m/hr) than monkeys in fragments. Bale monkeys in
   continuous forest used exclusively bamboo and mixed bamboo forest
   habitats while conspecifics in fragments used a greater variety of
   habitats including human use areas (i.e., matrix). Our findings suggest
   that Bale monkeys in fragments use an energy minimization strategy to
   cope with the lower availability of the species' primary food species,
   bamboo (Arundinaria alpina). We contend that Bale monkeys may retain
   some of the ancestral ecological flexibility assumed to be
   characteristic of the genus Chlorocebus, within which all extant species
   except Bale monkeys are regarded as ecological generalists. Our results
   suggest that, like other bamboo eating primates (e.g., the bamboo lemurs
   of Madagascar), Bale monkeys can cope with a certain threshold of
   habitat destruction. However, the long-term conservation prospects for
   Bale monkeys in fragments remain unclear and will require further
   monitoring to be properly evaluated.},

Title = {Evolution of microRNA in primates},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 22},
Abstract = {MicroRNA play an important role in post-transcriptional regulation of
   most transcripts in the human genome, but their evolution across the
   primate lineage is largely uncharacterized. A particular miRNA can have
   one to thousands of messenger RNA targets, establishing the potential
   for a small change in sequence or overall miRNA structure to have
   profound phenotypic effects. However, the majority of non-human primate
   miRNA is predicted solely by homology to the human genome and lacks
   experimental validation. In the present study, we sequenced thirteen
   species representing a wide range of the primate phylogeny. Hundreds of
   miRNA were validated, and the number of species with experimentally
   validated miRNA was tripled. These species include a sister taxon to
   humans (bonobo) and basal primates (aye-aye, mouse lemur, galago).
   Consistent with previous studies, we found the seed region and mature
   miRNA to be highly conserved across primates, with overall structural
   conservation of the pre-miRNA hairpin. However, there were a number of
   interesting exceptions, including a seed shift due to structural changes
   in miR-501. We also identified an increase in the number of miR-320
   paralogs throughout primate evolution. Many of these non-conserved miRNA
   appear to regulate neuronal processes, illustrating the importance of
   investigating miRNA to learn more about human evolution.},

Abstract = {It has been hypothesized that interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs),
   i.e., repeated telomeric DNA sequences found at intrachromosomal sites
   in many vertebrates, could be correlated to chromosomal rearrangements
   and plasticity. To test this hypothesis, we hybridized a telomeric PNA
   probe through FISH on representative species of 2 primate infraorders,
   Strepsirrhini (Lemur catta, Otolemur garnettii, Nycticebus coucang) and
   Catarrhini (Erythrocebus patas, Cercopithecus petaurista, Chlorocebus
   aethiops, Colobus guereza), as well as on 1 species of the order
   Scandentia, Tupaia minor, used as an outgroup for primates in
   phylogenetic reconstructions. In almost all primate species analyzed, we
   found a telomeric pattern only. In Tupaia, the hybridization revealed
   many bright ITSs on at least 11 chromosome pairs, both biarmed and
   acrocentric. These ITS signals in Tupaia correspond to fusion points of
   ancestral human syntenic associations, but are also present in other
   chromosomes showing synteny to only a single human chromosome. This
   distribution pattern was compared to that of the heterochromatin regions
   detected through sequential C-banding performed after FISH. Our results
   in the analyzed species, compared with literature data on ITSs in
   primates, allowed us to discuss different mechanisms responsible for the
   origin and distribution of ITSs, supporting the correlation between
   rearrangements and ITSs. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {44},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1331-1343},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {AimsQuantification of the degree to which ecological niches change over
   evolutionary time-scales is important for deepening our understanding of
   evolutionary and ecological processes. Phylogenetic niche conservatism
   (PNC) is when closely related species differ less ecologically than
   expected by chance, whereas Phylogenetic Niche Divergence (PND) is when
   closely related species differ more ecologically than expected by
   chance. We present a new null model to test for PNC and PND (the random
   translocation and rotation (RTR) significance test), which we combine
   with a novel metric for quantifying niche overlap.
   LocationEurope, North America and Madagascar.
   MethodsThe RTR null model comprises many thousands of replicates
   generated by randomly translocating and rotating the set of occurrence
   records for two populations (e.g. sister species) while maintaining the
   spatial configuration between all occurrences within each replicate. For
   each replicate, we calculate niche overlap as the proportion of the
   combined niche breadth that is shared by the two species, averaged over
   n environmental dimensions. This approach enables us to test whether the
   observed niche overlap is more or less than expected by chance given the
   environmental conditions present in the study area. We test the
   performance of our approach in comparison to other methods using both
   simulated and real case scenarios, including crested newts in Europe,
   pocket gophers in North America, and lemurs in Madagascar.
   ResultsWe find that our measure of niche overlap performs better than
   other metrics in an artificial simulation scenario, and we find evidence
   for both PNC and PND in our case studies for Europe, North America and
   Madagascar. Our results demonstrate that both the RTR significance test
   and the novel metric of niche overlap are consistent with evolutionary
   theory and are suitable methods to test for PNC and PND.
   Main conclusionsWe make available scripts to implement the RTR test and
   metric of niche overlap, and expect that the methods will prove useful
   for addressing a broad set of questions relating to ecological niche
   evolution and speciation, particularly for restricted-range species for
   which few known occurrence records are available.},

Title = {Quantification of the position and depth of the flexor hallucis longus
   groove in euarchontans, with implications for the evolution of primate
   positional behavior},

Abstract = {ObjectiveOn the talus, the position and depth of the groove for the
   flexor hallucis longus tendon have been used to infer phylogenetic
   affinities and positional behaviors of fossil primates. This study
   quantifies aspects of the flexor hallucis longus groove (FHLG) to test
   if: (1) a lateral FHLG is a derived strepsirrhine feature, (2) a lateral
   FHLG reflects inverted and abducted foot postures, and (3) a deeper FHLG
   indicates a larger muscle.
   MethodsWe used linear measurements of microCT-generated models from a
   sample of euarchontans (n=378 specimens, 125 species) to quantify FHLG
   position and depth. Data are analyzed with ANOVA, Ordinary and
   Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares, and Bayesian Ancestral State
   Reconstruction (ASR).
   ResultsExtant strepsirrhines, adapiforms, plesiadapiforms, dermopterans,
   and Ptilocercus exhibit lateral FHLGs. Extant anthropoids, subfossil
   lemurs, and Tupaia have medial FHLGs. FHLGs of omomyiforms and basal
   fossil anthropoids are intermediate between those of strepsirrhines and
   extant anthropoids. FHLG position has few correlations with pedal
   inversion features. Relative FHLG depth is not significantly correlated
   with body mass. ASRs support a directional model for FHLG position and a
   random walk model for FHLG depth.
   ConclusionsThe prevalence of lateral FHLGs in many non-euprimates
   suggests a lateral FHLG is not a derived strepsirrhine feature. The lack
   of correlations with pedal inversion features suggests a lateral FHLG is
   not a sufficient indicator of strepsirrhine-like foot postures. Instead,
   a lateral FHLG may reduce the risk of tendon displacement in abducted
   foot postures on large diameter supports. A deep FHLG does not indicate
   a larger muscle, but likely reduces bowstringing during plantarflexion.},

Title = {The dynamics of transmission and the dynamics of networks},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A toy example depicted here highlighting the results of a study in this
   issue of the Journal of Animal Ecology that investigates the impact of
   network dynamics on potential disease outbreaks. Infections (stars) that
   spread by contact only (left) reduce the predicted outbreak size
   compared to situations where individuals can become infected by moving
   through areas that previously contained infected individuals (right).
   This is potentially important in species where individuals, or in this
   case groups, have overlapping ranges (as depicted on the top right).
   Incorporating network dynamics that maintain information about the
   ordering of contacts (central blocks; including the ordering of spatial
   overlap as noted by the arrows that highlight the blue group arriving
   after the red group in top-right of the figure) is important for
   capturing how a disease might not have the opportunity to spread to all
   individuals. By contrast, a static or average' network (lower blocks)
   does not capture any of these dynamics. Interestingly, although static
   networks generally predict larger outbreak sizes, the authors find that
   in cases when transmission probability is low, this prediction can
   switch as a result of changes in the estimated intensity of contacts
   among individuals. {[}Colour figure can be viewed at ].
   The spread of disease or information through networks can be affected by
   several factors. Whether and how these factors are accounted for can
   fundamentally change the predicted impact of a spreading epidemic.
   Springer, Kappeler \& Nunn () investigate the role of different modes of
   transmission and network dynamics on the predicted size of a disease
   outbreak across several groups of Verreaux's sifakas, a group-living
   species of lemur. While some factors, such as seasonality, led to
   consistent differences in the structure of social networks, using
   dynamic vs. static representations of networks generated differences in
   the predicted outbreak size of an emergent disease. These findings
   highlight some of the challenges associated with studying disease
   dynamics in animal populations, and the importance of continuing efforts
   to develop the network tools needed to study disease spread.},

Title = {Night Monkey Hybrids Exhibit De Novo Genomic and Karyotypic Alterations:
   The First Such Case in Primates},

Abstract = {Using molecular chromosomal analyses, we discovered night monkey hybrids
   produced in captivity from matings between a female Aotus azarae
   boliviensis (2n=50) and a male Aotus lemurinus griseimembra (2n=53). The
   parents produced seven offspring in total, including one male and six
   females-a pattern consistent with Haldane's rule. Chromosomal studies
   were conducted on four of the hybrid offspring. Two of them showed
   relatively ``simple{''} mixture karyotypes, including different
   chromosome numbers (2n=51, 52), which were formed because of a
   heteromorphic autosome pair in the father (n=26,27). The other two
   hybrid monkeys exhibited de novo genomic and karyotypic alterations.
   Detailed analysis of the alterations revealed that one individual
   carried a mixture karyotype of the two parental species and an X
   chromosome trisomy (53,XXX). The second individual displayed trisomy of
   chromosome 18 (52,XX,+18) and a reciprocal translocation between
   autosomes21 and 23 (52, XX,+18, t(21; 23)). Interestingly, the second
   monkey exhibited mosaicism among blood cells(mos52,XX,+ 18{[}87]/52,
   XX,+18, t(21; 23){[}85]), but only a single karyotype (52, XX,+ 18) in
   skin fibroblast cells. The X-and 18-trisomies were derived from a
   doubling of the mother's chromosomes in early embryonic cell division,
   and the reciprocal translocation likely developed in the bone marrow of
   the offspring, considering that it was observed only in blood cells.
   Such occurrence of trisomies in hybrid individuals is a unique finding
   in placental mammals.},

Abstract = {Some anatomical studies have indicated that the anterolateral ligament
   (ALL) of the knee is distinct ligamentous structure in humans. The
   purpose of this study is to compare the lateral anatomy of the knee
   among human and various animal specimens.
   Fifty-eight fresh-frozen knee specimens, from 24 different animal
   species, were used for this anatomical study. The same researchers
   dissected all the specimens in this study, and dissections were
   performed in a careful and standardized manner.
   An ALL was not found in any of the 58 knees dissected. Another
   interesting finding in this study is that some primate species (the
   prosimians: the red and black and white lemurs) have two LCLs.
   The clinical relevance of this study is the lack of isolation of the ALL
   as a unique structure in animal species. Therefore, precaution is
   recommended before assessing the need for surgery to reconstruct the ALL
   as a singular ligament.},

Title = {Competition for dead trees between humans and aye-ayes (Daubentonia

Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {58},

Abstract = {The destruction and degradation of forest habitats are major threats to
   the sustainability of lemur populations in Madagascar. Madagascan
   landscapes often contain forest fragments that represent refuges for
   native fauna, while also being used for firewood and timber by local
   human populations. As undisturbed forest becomes increasingly scarce,
   understanding resource competition between humans and wildlife in
   disturbed habitats will be increasingly important. We tested the
   hypothesis that Malagasy and aye-ayes (Daubentonia madagascariensis)
   compete for the limited number of dead trees in rainforest fragments at
   Tsinjoarivo, Madagascar. We surveyed 2.16 ha within five fragments
   (range 5-228 ha) surrounding human settlements to quantify the density
   of dead trees and traces of both human and aye-aye activity. Neither
   aye-aye nor human traces were distributed according to the availability
   of particular trees species, and aye-ayes and Malagasy apparently
   preferred several different species. Although overlap was recorded in
   tree species used, human use tended to be positively correlated with a
   species' desirability as firewood, while a negative relationship was
   seen for aye-ayes. Both consumers used trees of similar diameter at
   breast height, but those used by aye-ayes tended to be older, suggesting
   that human use might precede usefulness for aye-ayes. Finally, the
   density of dead trees and aye-aye traces were highest in smaller
   fragments, but human traces did not vary across fragment size. Although
   further study is needed to better quantify the aye-aye diet in this
   region, these data suggest that aye-ayes and local people compete for
   dead trees, and this competition could constitute a pressure on aye-aye
   populations.},

Abstract = {Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is a multifunctional peptide that is
   involved in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological
   processes in many animal species, ranging from somatic growth in
   children to metabolism and tissue regeneration and repair in adults. The
   IGF1 gene is under multifactorial regulation in the few species in which
   it has been studied, with major control being exerted by growth hormone
   through a gene expression pathway involving inducible binding of the
   STAT5b transcription factor to dispersed enhancer elements. In this
   study, using resources available in public genomic databases, genes
   encoding IGF1 have been analyzed in a cohort of six nonhuman primate
   species representing > 60 million years of evolutionary diversification
   from a common ancestor: chimpanzee, gorilla, macaque, olive baboon,
   marmoset, and mouse lemur. The IGF1 gene has been well conserved among
   these primates. Similar to human IGF1, each gene appears to be composed
   of six exons and five introns, and contains recognizable tandem
   promoters, each with a unique leader exon. Exon and intron lengths are
   very similar, and DNA sequence conservation is high, not only in
   orthologous exons and promoter regions, but also in putative growth
   hormone-activated STAT5b-binding enhancers that are found in analogous
   locations in IGF1 intron 3 and in 5 ` distal intergenic DNA. Taken
   together, the high level of organizational and nucleotide sequence
   similarity in the IGF1 gene and locus among these seven species supports
   the contention that common regulatory paradigms had existed prior to the
   onset of primate speciation > 85 million years ago.},

Abstract = {Natural killer (NK) cells are a diverse population of lymphocytes with a
   range of biological roles including essential immune functions. NK cell
   diversity is in part created by the differential expression of cell
   surface receptors which modulate activation and function, including
   multiple subfamilies of C-type lectin receptors encoded within the NK
   complex (NKC). Little is known about the gene content of the NKC beyond
   rodent and primate lineages, other than it appears to be extremely
   variable between mammalian groups. We compared the NKC structure between
   mammalian species using new high-quality draft genome assemblies for
   cattle and goat; re-annotated sheep, pig, and horse genome assemblies;
   and the published human, rat, and mouse lemur NKC. The major NKC genes
   are largely in the equivalent positions in all eight species, with
   significant independent expansions and deletions between species,
   allowing us to propose a model for NKC evolution during mammalian
   radiation. The ruminant species, cattle and goats, have independently
   evolved a second KLRC locus flanked by KLRA and KLRJ, and a novel
   KLRH-like gene has acquired an activating tail. This novel gene has
   duplicated several times within cattle, while other activating receptor
   genes have been selectively disrupted. Targeted genome enrichment in
   cattle identified varying levels of allelic polymorphism between the NKC
   genes concentrated in the predicted extracellular ligand-binding
   domains. This novel recombination and allelic polymorphism is consistent
   with NKC evolution under balancing selection, suggesting that this
   diversity influences individual immune responses and may impact on
   differential outcomes of pathogen infection and vaccination.},

Title = {Phosphorylation of Rab-coupling protein by LMTK3 controls
   Rab14-dependent EphA2 trafficking to promote cell: cell repulsion},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The Rab GTPase effector, Rab-coupling protein (RCP) is known to promote
   invasive behaviour in vitro by controlling integrin and receptor
   tyrosine kinase (RTK) trafficking, but how RCP influences metastasis in
   vivo is unclear. Here we identify an RTK of the Eph family, EphA2, to be
   a cargo of an RCP-regulated endocytic pathway which controls cell: cell
   repulsion and metastasis in vivo. Phosphorylation of RCP at Ser(435) by
   Lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3) and of EphA2 at Ser(897) by Akt are both
   necessary to promote Rab14-dependent (and Rab11-independent) trafficking
   of EphA2 which generates cell: cell repulsion events that drive tumour
   cells apart. Genetic disruption of RCP or EphA2 opposes cell: cell
   repulsion and metastasis in an autochthonous mouse model of pancreatic
   adenocarcinoma-whereas conditional knockout of another RCP cargo, alpha
   5 integrin, does not suppress pancreatic cancer metastasis-indicating a
   role for RCP-dependent trafficking of an Eph receptor to drive tumour
   dissemination in vivo.},

   potential and imagining: the waning of enthusiasm about deep-sea
   exploration and the disillusionment of radical social movements with the
   emerging conservatism of the 1970s. These two sites come together in
   Thomas Pynchon's Inherent Vice, where a drug-addled and waning
   counterculture finds its hopes and disillusionments bound up in the myth
   of a sunken continent in the Pacific Ocean. Reading this continent,
   Lemuria, as a heterotopia, and applying an archetypal, psychological,
   and spatial reading to a novel normally read as an exemplar of
   postmodern aesthetics and paranoid epistemologies allows for a
   rethinking of postmodern allegory as not necessarily disruptive of a
   historical continuum, but as confused, melancholy, and fundamentally
   lost.},

Abstract = {Crude fish oil is one of essential fatty acid sources, which is found in
   Sardinella lemuru. This research aims to study the quality improvement
   of mudcrab(Scylla serrate) feed. Four feed formulations were designed by
   using completely randomized design, including P-0 = trash fish + tapioca
   starch; P-1 = trash fish + 2.0 \% crude fish oil + 1\% tapioca starch;,
   P-2 = trash fish + 4.0 \% crude fish oil + 1\% tapioca starch; P-3 =
   trash fish + 6.0 crude fish oil + 1\% tapioca starch; P-4 = trash fish +
   8.0 \% crude fish oil + 1\% tapioca starch, respectively, which were
   carried out in quadruplicate. This study showed that feed formulation
   significantly affected crude protein, crude fiber, crude lipid, ash,
   organic matter and nitrogen free extract and energy of mudcrab. The P-2
   feed was the best formulation but had a slight different from P-3
   formulation..},

   terrestrial, and solitary to groups of thousands, and they range in body
   mass from the 30-g pygmy mouse lemur (Microcebus myoxinus) to the 175-kg
   eastern lowland gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri). Nonhuman primates
   vary in their auditory sensitivity and perceptual capabilities and emit
   a wide range of often complex vocalizations. Some aspects of primate
   audition and vocalizations have been related to each other and/or
   phylogeny, anatomy, and ecology, but many aspects have yet to be fully
   understood. The integration of anatomical and behavioral data on
   acoustic communication, and the correlates thereof, have significant
   potential for reconstructing behavior in the fossil record, including
   that of humans. This volume presents a comprehensive review of nonhuman
   primate audition and vocal communication to bridge these closely related
   topics that are often addressed separately. The first section of the
   book is a discussion of primate sound production, reception, and
   perception, as well as habitat acoustics in the environmental settings
   occupied by primates in the wild. The second section focuses on vocal
   communication in extant primates, including consideration of spectral
   analyses of primate calls and the evolutionary relationships among
   hearing, vocal communication, and human language. The goal for this
   comprehensive approach is to provide new insights into these related
   topics.},

Abstract = {We introduce novel software techniques to implement dynamic,
   network-aware, energy-efficient download managers that significantly
   reduce battery drain due to weak Wi-Fi signal strength. These techniques
   are designed to be used in download managers that are implemented as an
   option for data-intensive, delay-tolerant mobile applications to use to
   download data. The techniques include polling the network to determine
   when the Wi-Fi signal strength is above a user-configurable
   signal-strength threshold to start or continue down-loading files, and
   polling the network during file downloads to determine if the signal
   strength falls below the signal-strength threshold to pause file
   downloads. When a file download is paused because the signal strength is
   below the signal-strength threshold, the user has the option of
   overriding this feature to continue the file download if the user needs
   the file immediately. We also introduce a novel dynamic, network-aware,
   energy-efficient download manager, the Lemur download manager, that
   implements these techniques. We present results that demonstrate that
   the Lemur download manager significantly reduces battery drain due to
   weak Wi-Fi signal strength.},

Abstract = {Recently, several theorists have proposed that we can perceive a range
   of high-level features, including natural kind features (e.g., being a
   lemur), artifactual features (e.g., being a mandolin), and the emotional
   features of others (e.g., being surprised). I clarify the claim that we
   perceive high-level features and suggest one overlooked reason this
   claim matters: it would dramatically expand the range of actions
   perception-based theories of action might explain. I then describe the
   influential phenomenal contrast method of arguing for high-level
   perception and discuss some of the objections that have been raised
   against this strategy. Finally, I describe two emerging defenses of
   high-level perception, one of which appeals to a certain class of
   perceptual deficits and one of which appeals to adaptation effects. I
   sketch a challenge for the latter approach.},

Abstract = {Molecular analyses of the last decades helped solving the major open
   questions on the external and internal phylogenetic relationships of
   primates. The present review uses these data for the inference of
   character evolution along the branches of the primate tree. Altogether,
   more than 200 evolutionary changes in hard and soft tissue
   anatomy/morphology, behavior, physiology, and protein constitution are
   presented in the context of their functional relevance and adaptive
   value. The compilation focuses on primates as a whole and on the
   higher-ranked primate subtaxa with living representatives: Strepsirhini:
   Lorisiformes, Galagidae, Lorisidae, Lemuriformes; Haplorhini:
   Tarsioidea, Anthropoidea, Platyrrhini, Atelidae + Cebidae, Atelidae,
   Cebidae, Aotinae, Callithrichinae, Cebinae, Pitheciidae, Pithecinae,
   Catarrhini, Cercopithecoidea, Cercopithecinae, Colobinae, Colobini, and
   Hominoidea. Within Hominoidea character evolution is traced down to more
   peripheral branches: Hylobatidae, Hominidae, Pongo, Homininae, Gorilla,
   Pan + Homo, Pan, and modern humans. Character states in extinct
   representatives of Plesiadapiformes, Omomyoidea, Propliopithecidae,
   Hominini, etc. are always taken into account; they are presented in
   detail whenever character-state distribution in living species is
   ambiguous or misleading. The taxonomic sample and the characters
   included combine to a phylogenetic system that illustrates primate
   evolution and diversity. The data presented additionally provide a
   detailed picture of the evolutionary steps and trends involved in
   hominization. Reflections on the frequently underestimated role of
   polymorphisms in phylogenetic analyses complete the survey.},

Title = {Turning a Problem Into Profit: Using Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia
   crassipes) for Making Handicrafts at Lake Alaotra, Madagascar},
Journal = {ECONOMIC BOTANY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In diverse ecosystems, invasive plant species represent a serious threat
   for nature conservation by leading to loss of native species as well as
   environmental degradation. The water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes)
   belongs to the top 10 worldwide most troublesome aquatic weeds. This
   study assesses the use of this invasive plant as a new source of raw
   material for handicrafts to substitute for the traditionally used
   papyrus (Cyperus madagascariensis) in the poor and remote region of Lake
   Alaotra in Madagascar. It has been recently observed that the current
   exploitation of papyrus in this region adds pressure on the receding
   Alaotra wetland and notably decreases habitat and food resources for the
   locally endemic and critically endangered lemur species Hapalemur
   alaotrensis. Within our research, water hyacinth handicrafts were
   produced by local artisans and compared with papyrus handicrafts
   regarding production path (collection, transportation, and processing of
   raw material) with a focus on financial costs, workload, and selling
   price. In addition, structured interviews were conducted with town-based
   handicraft retailers and potential customers to specify market
   expectations (quality, design, and marketing strategies). Our study
   revealed that despite the requirement for a longer time regarding raw
   material selection and drying (7 days vs 3 days) as well as additional
   financial costs (23\% in addition) for ornaments, water hyacinth
   handicrafts displayed many advantages in comparison to papyrus
   handicrafts: (a) assembling water hyacinth handicrafts was easier and
   faster (33\% less time investment), (b) led to robust products that were
   rated as being of acceptable to very good quality by 91\% of the
   interviewees (c) and sold at three times (mean 2.25 US\$) the sale
   prices of the traditional papyrus handicrafts (mean 0.75 US\$). The use
   of water hyacinth has therefore the potential to increase local
   household incomes, open up new markets, and attenuate the pressure on
   the Alaotra wetland biodiversity by reducing the use of papyrus. A SWOT
   (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis combined
   with research findings on rural handicrafts was drafted to identify four
   main steps for promoting the market establishment of water hyacinth
   handicrafts at Lake Alaotra: creation of artisans' clusters and
   networks, improvement of managerial and marketing competence, access to
   finance and exploration of markets possibilities. This research can
   provide insights for other small rural handicraft enterprises in
   developing countries facing problem with water hyacinth throughout the
   world.},

Abstract = {We introduce a new method to geometrically reconstruct eye volume and
   placement in small-bodied primates based on the three-dimensional
   contour of the intraorbital surface. We validate it using seven species
   of living primates, with dry skulls and wet dissections, and test its
   application on seven species of Paleogene fossils of interest. The
   method performs well even when the orbit is damaged and incomplete,
   lacking the postorbital bar and represented only by the orbital floor.
   Eye volume is an important quantity for anatomic and metabolic reasons,
   which due to differences in eye set, or position within (or outside) the
   bony orbit, can be underestimated in living and fossil forms when
   calculated from aperture diameter. Our Ectopic Index quantifies how much
   the globe's volume protrudes anteriorly from the aperture. Lemur,
   Notharctus and Rooneyia resemble anthropoids, with deeply recessed eyes
   protruding 11\%-13\%. Galago and Tarsius are the other extreme, at
   47\%-56\%. We argue that a laterally oriented aperture has little to do
   with line-of-sight in euprimates, as large ectopic eyes can position the
   cornea to enable a directly forward viewing axis, and soft tissue
   positions the eyes facing forward in megachiropteran bats, which have
   unenclosed, open eye sockets. The size and set of virtual eyes
   reconstructed from 3D cranial models confirm that eyes were large to
   hypertrophic in Hemiacodon, Necrolemur, Microchoerus, Pseudoloris and
   Shoshonius, but eye size in Rooneyia may have been underestimated by
   measuring the aperture, as in Aotus. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Title = {Holding-on: co-evolution between infant carrying and grasping behaviour
   in strepsirrhines},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {The origin and evolution of manual grasping remain poorly understood.
   The ability to cling requires important grasping abilities and is
   essential to survive in species where the young are carried in the fur.
   A previous study has suggested that this behaviour could be a
   pre-adaptation for the evolution of fine manipulative skills. In this
   study we tested the co-evolution between infant carrying in the fur and
   manual grasping abilities in the context of food manipulation. As
   strepsirrhines vary in the way infants are carried (mouth vs. fur), they
   are an excellent model to test this hypothesis. Data on food
   manipulation behaviour were collected for 21 species of strepsirrhines.
   Our results show that furcarrying species exhibited significantly more
   frequent manual grasping of food items. This study clearly illustrates
   the potential novel insights that a behaviour (infant carrying) that has
   previously been largely ignored in the discussion of the evolution of
   primate manipulation can bring.},

Title = {Preliminary analysis of Psoroptes ovis transcriptome in different
   developmental stages},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 4},
Abstract = {Background: Psoroptic mange is a chronic, refractory, contagious and
   infectious disease mainly caused by the mange mite Psoroptes ovis, which
   can infect horses, sheep, buffaloes, rabbits, other domestic animals,
   deer, wild camels, foxes, minks, lemurs, alpacas, elks and other wild
   animals. Features of the disease include intense pruritus and
   dermatitis, depilation and hyperkeratosis, which ultimately result in
   emaciation or death caused by secondary bacterial infections. The
   infestation is usually transmitted by close contact between animals.
   Psoroptic mange is widespread in the world. In this paper, the
   transcriptome of P. ovis is described following sequencing and analysis
   of transcripts from samples of larvae (i.e. the Pso\_L group) and nymphs
   and adults (i.e. the Pso\_N\_A group). The study describes
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and genes encoding allergens,
   which help understanding the biology of P. ovis and lay foundations for
   the development of vaccine antigens and drug target screening.
   Methods: The transcriptome of P. ovis was assembled and analyzed using
   bioinformatic tools. The unigenes of P. ovis from each developmental
   stage and the unigenes differentially between developmental stages were
   compared with allergen protein sequences contained in the allergen
   database website to predict potential allergens.
   Results: We identified 38,836 unigenes, whose mean length was 825 bp. On
   the basis of sequence similarity with seven databases, a total of 17,366
   unigenes were annotated. A total of 1,316 DEGs were identified,
   including 496 upregulated and 820 downregulated in the Pso\_L group
   compared with the Pso\_N\_A group. We predicted 205 allergens genes in
   the two developmental stages similar to genes from other mites and
   ticks, of these, 14 were among the upregulated DEGs and 26 among the
   downregulated DEGs.
   Conclusion: This study provides a reference transcriptome of P. ovis in
   absence of a reference genome. The analysis of DEGs and putative
   allergen genes may lay the foundation for studies of functional
   genomics, immunity and gene expression profiles of this parasitic mite
   species.},

Title = {Stability in skipping gaits},
Journal = {Royal Society Open Science},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As an alternative to walking and running, humans are able to skip.
   However, adult humans avoid it. This fact seems to be related to the
   higher energetic costs associated with skipping. Still, children, some
   birds, lemurs and lizards use skipping gaits during daily locomotion. We
   combined experimental data on humans with numerical simulations to test
   whether stability and robustness motivate this choice. Parameters for
   modelling were obtained from 10 male subjects. They locomoted using
   unilateral skipping along a 12 m runway. We used a bipedal spring loaded
   inverted pendulum to model and to describe the dynamics of skipping. The
   subjects displayed higher peak ground reaction forces and leg stiffness
   in the first landing leg (trailing leg) compared to the second landing
   leg (leading leg). In numerical simulations, we found that skipping is
   stable across an amazing speed range from skipping on the spot to fast
   running speeds. Higher leg stiffness in the trailing leg permits longer
   strides at same system energy. However, this strategy is at the same
   time less robust to sudden drop perturbations than skipping with a
   stiffer leading leg. A slightly higher stiffness in the leading leg is
   most robust, but might be costlier.},

Title = {New euprimate postcrania from the early Eocene of Gujarat, India, and
   the strepsirrhine-haplorhine divergence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {25-51},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The oldest primates of modern aspect (euprimates) appear abruptly on the
   Holarctic continents during a brief episode of global warming known as
   the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, at the beginning of the Eocene
   (similar to 56 Ma). When they first appear in the fossil record, they
   are already divided into two distinct clades, Adapoidea (basal members
   of Strepsirrhini, which includes extant lemurs, lorises, and bushbabies)
   and Omomyidae (basal Haplorhini, which comprises living tarsiers,
   monkeys, and apes). Both groups have recently been discovered in the
   early Eocene Cambay Shale Formation of Vastan lignite mine, Gujarat,
   India, where they are known mainly from teeth and jaws. The Vastan
   fossils are dated at similar to 54.5 Myr based on associated
   dinoflagellates and isotope stratigraphy. Here, we describe new,
   exquisitely preserved limb bones of these Indian primates that reveal
   more primitive postcranial characteristics than have been previously
   documented for either Glade, and differences between them are so minor
   that in many cases we cannot be certain to which group they belong.
   Nevertheless, the small distinctions observed in some elements
   foreshadow postcranial traits that distinguish the groups by the middle
   Eocene, suggesting that the Vastan primates though slightly younger than
   the oldest known euprimates may represent the most primitive known
   remnants of the divergence between the two great primate clades. (C)

Abstract = {Neurite formation, a fundamental process in neuronal maturation,
   requires the coordinated regulation of cytoskeletal reorganization and
   membrane transport. Compared to the understanding of cytoskeletal
   functions, less is known about the supply of membranes to growing
   neurites. Lemur kinase 1A (LMTK1A) is an endosomal protein kinase that
   is highly expressed in neurons. We recently reported that LMTK1A
   regulates the trafficking of Rab11-positive recycling endosomes in
   growing axons and dendrites. Here, we used the kinase-negative (kn)
   mutant to investigate the role of the kinase activity of LMTK1A in its
   cellular localization and interactions with the cytoskeleton in Neuro2A
   and PC-12 cells. Kinase activity was required for the localization of
   LMTK1A in the perinuclear endocytic recycling compartment. Perinuclear
   accumulation was microtubule dependent, and LMTK1A wild type (wt)
   localized mainly on microtubules, whereas kn LMTK1A was found in the
   actin-rich cell periphery. In the neurites of PC-12 cells, LMTK1A showed
   contrasting distributions depending on the kinase activity, with wt
   being located in the microtubule-rich shaft and the kn form in the
   actin-rich tip. Taken together, these results suggest that the kinase
   activity of LMTK1A regulates the pathway for endosomal vesicles to
   transfer from microtubules to actin filaments at the tip of growing
   neurites.},

Title = {A juvenile subfossil crocodylian from Anjohibe Cave, Northwestern
   Madagascar},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Madagascar's subfossil record preserves a diverse community of animals
   including elephant birds, pygmy hippopotamus, giant lemurs, turtles,
   crocodiles, bats, rodents, and carnivorans. These fossil accumulations
   give us a window into the island's past from 80,000 years ago to a mere
   few hundred years ago, recording the extinction of some groups and the
   persistence of others. The crocodylian subfossil record is limited to
   two taxa, Voay robustus and Crocodylus niloticus, found at sites
   distributed throughout the island. Voay robustus is extinct while C.
   niloticus is still found on the island today, but whether these two
   species overlapped temporally, or if Voay was driven to extinction by
   competing with Crocodylus remains unknown. While their size and presumed
   behavior was similar to each other, nearly nothing is known about the
   growth and development of Voay, as the overwhelming majority of fossil
   specimens represent mature adult individuals. Here we describe a nearly
   complete juvenile crocodylian specimen from Anjohibe Cave, northwestern
   Madagascar. The specimen is referred to Crocodylus based on the presence
   of caviconchal recesses on the medial wall of the maxillae, and to C.
   niloticus based on the presence of an oval shaped internal choana, lack
   of rostral ornamentation and a long narrow snout. However, as there are
   currently no described juvenile specimens of Voay robustus,it is
   important to recognize that some of the defining characteristics of that
   genus may have changed through ontogeny. Elements include a nearly
   complete skull and many postcranial elements (cervical, thoracic,
   sacral, and caudal vertebrae, pectoral elements, pelvic elements,
   forelimb and hindlimb elements, osteoderms). Crocodylus niloticus
   currently inhabits Madagascar but is locally extinct from this
   particular region; radiometric dating indicates an age of similar to
   460-310 years before present (BP). This specimen clearly represents a
   juvenile based on the extremely small size and open sutures/detached
   neural arches; total body length is estimated to be similar to
   1.1m(modern adults of this species range from similar to 4-6 m). This
   fossil represents the only juvenile subfossil crocodylian specimen
   reported from Madagascar.},

   (Atelidae) and Callicebus moloch (Pithecidae), characterized by a rapid
   radiation and a high rate of chromosomal rearrangements. Our analysis of
   the probe signal localization allowed us to show in all the species
   analysed, as normally, the telomeric location at the terminal ends of
   chromosomes and unexpected signal distributions in some species. Indeed,
   in three species among the nine studied, Aotus lemurinus griseimembra,
   Aotus nancymaae (Cebidae) and Lagothrix lagotricha (Atelidae), we showed
   a high variability in terms of localization and degree of amplification
   of interstitial telomeric sequences, especially for the ones found at
   centromeric or pericentromeric positions (het-ITS). A comparative
   analysis, between species, of homologous chromosomes to human syntenies,
   on which we have found positive interspersed PNA signals, allowed us to
   explain the observed pattern of ITS distribution as results of
   chromosomal rearrangements in the neotropical primates analysed. This
   evidence permitted us to discuss the possible implication of ITSs as
   phylogenetic markers for closely related species. Moreover, reviewing
   previous literature data of ITSs distribution in Primates and in the
   light of our results, we suggest an underestimation of ITSs and
   highlight the importance of the molecular cytogenetics approach in
   characterizing ITSs, which role is still not clarified.
   Riassunto La distribuzione delle sequenze telomeriche intersperse sui
   cromosomi di nove Platyrrhinae: possibili implicazioni evolutive e
   filogenetiche Al fine di localizzare le sequence telomeriche intersperse
   (ITS) e verificare se il loro pattern di distribuzione e ricollegabile
   all'evoluzione cromosomica sono state ibridate sonde telomeriche
   (TTAGGG)n sulle metafasi di specie Platyrrhinae caratterizzate da una
   rapida radiazione ed da un alto tasso di riarrangiamenti cromosomomici:
   Callithrix argentata, Callithrix jacchus, Cebuella pygmaea, Saguinus
   oedipus, Saimiri sciureus, Aotus lemurinus griseimembra, Aotus nancymaae
   (Cebidae), Lagothrix lagotricha (Atelidae), e Callicebus moloch
   (Pithecidae). L'analisi del segnale della sonda PNA mappato sui
   cromosomi ha permesso di dimostrare, in tutte le specie, come atteso, la
   normale localizzazione delle sequenze telomeriche sulle estremita
   terminali dei cromosomi e solo su alcune di esse, invece, una
   distribuzione peculiare delle sequenze telomeriche intersperse. Infatti
   in tre specie tra le nove analizzate Aotus lemurinus griseimembra, Aotus
   nancymaae (Cebidae), e Lagothrix lagotricha (Atelidae) e stata
   dimostrata un'alta variabilita nella distribuzione e nel grado di
   amplificazione delle ITS, in special modo per quelle riscontrate in
   regioni centro o pericentromeriche (het-ITS). L'analisi comparativa dei
   cromosomi delle specie in esame, omologhi alle sintenie cromosomiche
   umane, sui quali si sono riscontrati segnali della sonda PNA
   interspersi, ha permesso di spiegare il pattern di distribuzione delle
   ITS osservato come risultato di riarrangiamenti cromosomici verificatesi
   nel corso dell'evoluzione in Primates, in particolar modo in
   Platyrrhinae. Queste evidenze hanno inoltre permesso di discutere le
   possibili implicazioni delle ITS come marker filogenetici. In ultimo, da
   un'analisi dei dati presenti in letteratura sulla distribuzione delle
   ITS in Primates ed alla luce dei risultati ottenuti si ipotizza che gli
   ITS possano essere stati sottostimati e si evidenzia l'importanza
   dell'approccio citogenetico nello studio degli ITS, sequenze il cui
   ruolo e ancora poco conosciuto e che meriterebbe maggiori
   approfondimenti.},

Abstract = {Amphibians around the world are declining from threats that cannot
   currently be mitigated, making it impossible to safeguard some species
   in their natural habitats. Amphibians in the mountainous neotropics are
   one example where severe disease-related declines prompted calls for the
   establishment of captive assurance colonies to avoid extinctions. We
   surveyed experts in Panamanian amphibians to determine the probability
   of avoiding chytridiomycosis-related extinctions using captive breeding
   programs. We ranked Panamanian amphibian species by perceived
   susceptibility to chytridiomycosis, then calculated the likelihood of
   avoiding extinction as the product of three probabilities, which include
   (1) finding sufficient founder animals, (2) successfully breeding these
   species in captivity and (3) becoming extinct in the wild. The
   likelihood of finding enough animals to create a captive founding
   population was low for many rare species, especially for salamanders and
   caecilians. It was also low for frogs which were once regularly
   encountered, but have already disappeared including Atelopus
   chiriquiensis, Craugastor emcelae, C. obesus, C. punctariolus, C.
   rhyacobatrachus, Ecnomiohyla rabborum, Isthmohyla calypsa and Oophaga
   speciosa. Our results indicate that captive breeding could improve the
   odds of avoiding extinction for species that have severely declined or
   are likely to decline due to chytridiomycosis including Atelopus certus,
   A. glyphus, A. limosus, A. varius, A. zeteki, Anotheca spinosa,
   Gastrotheca cornuta, Agalychnis lemur and Hemiphractus fasciatus.
   Priority species that experts predicted were highly susceptible to
   chytridiomycosis that might also benefit from ex situ management include
   Craugastor tabasarae, C. azueroensis, C. evanesco, Strabomantis
   bufoniformis and Colostethus panamansis. In spite of high levels of
   uncertainty, this expert assessment approach allowed us to refine our
   priorities for captive amphibian programs in Panama and identify
   priority conservation actions with a clearer understanding of the
   probability of success.},

Title = {Optimizing conservation policy: the importance of seasonal variation in

Abstract = {Studying seasonal hunting patterns can be critical for developing sound
   actions for conservation and public health. As availability of funds to
   implement conservation policy is limited, it is essential to focus
   efforts during the most critical times of year. During July 2011-June
   2012 I recorded direct observations of hunting of forest mammals, and
   conducted daily 24-hour recall surveys (2 weeks per month over.. months:
   August 2011-June 2012), and interviews of all households in a focal
   village on the Masoala Peninsula of Madagascar to investigate (1) what
   drives seasonal hunting patterns and (2) how seasonal variation in
   consumption of wildlife and domestic meat affects native species and
   people. There is marked seasonal variation in hunting of forest mammals
   and in the consumption of fish and domesticated livestock on the Masoala
   Peninsula. Hunters target bushpigs Potamochoerus larvatus and tenrec and
   lemur species during the austral winter (March-August), whereas more
   native and introduced carnivorans, fish and domesticated livestock are
   consumed during the austral summer (September-February). The results
   suggest that seasonal variation in hunting patterns is driven by the
   physical and behavioural characteristics of prey rather than seasonal
   scarcity of alternative meat. Seasonal hunting and meat consumption on
   the Masoala Peninsula may amplify the negative impact of hunting on
   native carnivorans and tenrecs (which are hunted when they are pregnant
   and lactating), and the positive impact of consumption of lemurs,
   bushpigs and tenrecs on human health. This study highlights an important
   aspect of hunting on the Masoala: the decision whether or not to hunt is
   made independently of decisions regarding when to hunt particular
   species.},

Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Environmental insecurity is a source and outcome of biodiversity
   declines and social conflict. One challenge to scaling insecurity
   reduction policies is that empirical evidence about local attitudes is
   overwhelmingly missing. We set three objectives: determine how local
   people rank risk associated with different sources of environmental
   insecurity; assess perceptions of environmental insecurity, biodiversity
   exploitation, myths of nature and risk management preferences; and
   explore relationships between perceptions and biodiversity exploitation.
   We conducted interviews (N = 88) with residents of Madagascar's
   Torotorofotsy Protected Area, 2014. Risk perceptions had a moderate
   effect on perceptions of environmental insecurity. We found no effects
   of environmental insecurity on biodiversity exploitation. Results offer
   one if not the first exploration of local perceptions of illegal
   biodiversity exploitation and environmental security. Local people's
   perception of risk seriousness associated with illegal biodiversity
   exploitation such as lemur hunting (low overall) may not reflect
   perceptions of policy-makers (considered to be high). Discord is a key
   entry point for attention.},

Title = {Personalized multimedia content delivery on an interactive table by

Journal = {MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {75},

Abstract = {The amount of multimedia data collected in museum databases is growing
   fast, while the capacity of museums to display information to visitors
   is acutely limited by physical space. Museums must seek the perfect
   balance of information given on individual pieces in order to provide
   sufficient information to aid visitor understanding while maintaining
   sparse usage of the walls and guaranteeing high appreciation of the
   exhibit. Moreover, museums often target the interests of average
   visitors instead of the entire spectrum of different interests each
   individual visitor might have. Finally, visiting a museum should not be
   an experience contained in the physical space of the museum but a door
   opened onto a broader context of related artworks, authors, artistic
   trends, etc. In this paper we describe the MNEMOSYNE system that
   attempts to address these issues through a new multimedia museum
   experience. Based on passive observation, the system builds a profile of
   the artworks of interest for each visitor. These profiles of interest
   are then used to drive an interactive table that personalizes multimedia
   content delivery. The natural user interface on the interactive table
   uses the visitor's profile, an ontology of museum content and a
   recommendation system to personalize exploration of multimedia content.
   At the end of their visit, the visitor can take home a personalized
   summary of their visit on a custom mobile application. In this article
   we describe in detail each component of our approach as well as the
   first field trials of our prototype system built and deployed at our
   permanent exhibition space at LeMurate
   (http://www.lemurate.comune.fi.it/lemurate/) in Florence together with
   the first results of the evaluation process during the official
   installation in the National Museum of Bargello

   an exhaustive literature review and expert consultation process we
   recorded all mammal eradications, and species recoveries which could be
   attributed to introduced mammal eradication or control. All island
   groups have been invaded by mammals, and invasive cats and rats in
   particular are ubiquitous, but cultural contingency has also led to
   regional invasions by other mammals such as lemurs, civets and tenrecs.
   Mammal eradications have been attempted on 45 islands in the WIO, the
   majority in the Seychelles and Mauritius, and where successful have
   resulted in spectacular recovery of species and ecosystems. Invasive
   mammalian predator eradication or control in association with habitat
   management has led to improved conservation prospects for at least 24
   species, and IUCN red-list down-listing of eight species, in the
   Mascarene Islands. Future island conservation prioritisation in the
   region will need to take account of global climate change and predicted
   sea-level rises and coastal inundation. Greater investment and
   prioritisation in island conservation in the region is warranted, given
   its high biodiversity values and the extent of invasions. (C) 2016 The

Title = {Highly Variable Streptococcus oralis Strains Are Common among Viridans
   Streptococci Isolated from Primates},
Journal = {MSPHERE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {1},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Viridans streptococci were obtained from primates (great apes, rhesus
   monkeys, and ring-tailed lemurs) held in captivity, as well as from
   free-living animals (chimpanzees and lemurs) for whom contact with
   humans is highly restricted. Isolates represented a variety of viridans
   streptococci, including unknown species. Streptococcus oralis was
   frequently isolated from samples from great apes. Genotypic methods
   revealed that most of the strains clustered on separate lineages outside
   the main cluster of human S. oralis strains. This suggests that S.
   oralis is part of the commensal flora in higher primates and evolved
   prior to humans. Many genes described as virulence factors in
   Streptococcus pneumoniae were present also in other viridans
   streptococcal genomes. Unlike in S. pneumoniae, clustered regularly
   interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein
   (Cas) gene clusters were common among viridans streptococci, and many S.
   oralis strains were type PI-2 (pilus islet 2) variants. S. oralis
   displayed a remarkable diversity of genes involved in the biosynthesis
   of peptidoglycan (penicillin-binding proteins and MurMN) and
   choline-containing teichoic acid. The small noncoding cia-dependent
   small RNAs (csRNAs) controlled by the response regulator CiaR might
   contribute to the genomic diversity, since we observed novel genomic
   islands between duplicated csRNAs, variably present in some isolates.
   All S. oralis genomes contained a beta-N-acetyl- hexosaminidase gene
   absent in S. pneumoniae, which in contrast frequently harbors the
   neuraminidases NanB/C, which are absent in S. oralis. The identification
   of S. oralis-specific genes will help us to understand their adaptation
   to diverse habitats.
   IMPORTANCE Streptococcus pneumoniae is a rare example of a
   human-pathogenic bacterium among viridans streptococci, which consist of
   commensal symbionts, such as the close relatives Streptococcus mitis and
   S. oralis. We have shown that S. oralis can frequently be isolated from
   primates and a variety of other viridans streptococci as well. Genes and
   genomic islands which are known pneumococcal virulence factors are
   present in S. oralis and S. mitis, documenting the widespread occurrence
   of these compounds, which encode surface and secreted proteins. The
   frequent occurrence of CRISP-Cas gene clusters and a surprising
   variation of a set of small noncoding RNAs are factors to be considered
   in future research to further our understanding of mechanisms involved
   in the genomic diversity driven by horizontal gene transfer among
   viridans streptococci.},

Title = {LMTK3 escapes tumour suppressor miRNAs via sequestration of DDX5},
Journal = {CANCER LETTERS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {372},

Abstract = {Lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3) plays an important role in cancer
   progression and is associated with breast, lung, gastric and colorectal
   cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous non-coding RNAs that
   typically repress target genes at post-transcriptional level and have an
   important role in tumorigenesis. By performing a miRNA expression
   profile, we identified a subset of miRNAs modulated by LMTK3. We show
   that LMTK3 induces miR-34a, miR-196-a2 and miR-182 levels by interacting
   with DEAD-box RNA helicase p68 (DDX5). LMTK3 binds via DDX5 to the
   pri-miRNA of these three mature miRNAs, thereby sequestrating them from
   further processing. Ectopic expression of miR-34a and miR-182 in
   LMTK3-overexpressing cell lines (MCF7-LMTK3 and MDA-MB-231-LMTK3)
   inhibits breast cancer proliferation, invasion and migration.
   Interestingly, miR-34a and miR-182 directly bind to the 3'UTR of LMTK3
   mRNA and consequently inhibit both its stability and translation, acting
   as tumour suppressor-like miRNAs. In aggregate, we show that LMTK3 is
   involved in miRNA biogenesis through modulation of the Microprocessor
   complex, inducing miRNAs that target LMTK3 itself. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Social structure and Escherichia coli sharing in a group-living wild
   primate, Verreaux's sifaka},
Journal = {BMC ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Background: Epidemiological models often use information on host social
   contacts to predict the potential impact of infectious diseases on host
   populations and the efficiency of control measures. It can be difficult,
   however, to determine whether social contacts are actually meaningful
   predictors of transmission. We investigated the role of host social
   structure in the transmission of Escherichia coli in a wild population
   of primates, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi). Using
   multilocus sequence typing (MLST), we compared genetic similarities
   between E. coli isolates from different individuals and groups to infer
   transmission pathways.
   Results: Correlation of social and transmission networks revealed that
   membership to the same group significantly predicted sharing of E. coli
   MLST sequence types (ST). Intergroup encounter rate and a measure of
   space-use sharing provided equally potent explanations for type sharing
   between social groups when closely related STs were taken into account,
   whereas animal age, sex and dispersal history had no influence. No
   antibiotic resistance was found, suggesting low rates of E. coli
   spillover from humans into this arboreal species.
   Conclusions: We show that patterns of E. coli transmission reflect the
   social structure of this group living lemur species. We discuss our
   results in the light of the species' ecology and propose scent marking,
   a type of social contact not considered in previous epidemiological
   studies, as a likely route of transmission between groups. However,
   further studies are needed to explicitly test this hypothesis and to
   further elucidate the relative roles of direct contact and environmental
   transmission in pathogen transfer.},

Title = {An early Oligocene fossil demonstrates treeshrews are slowly evolving
   ``living fossils{''}},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JAN 14},
Abstract = {Treeshrews are widely considered a ``living model{''} of an ancestral
   primate, and have long been called ``living fossils{''}. Actual fossils
   of treeshrews, however, are extremely rare. We report a new fossil
   species of Ptilocercus treeshrew recovered from the early Oligocene
   (similar to 34 Ma) of China that represents the oldest definitive fossil
   record of the crown group of treeshrews and nearly doubles the temporal
   length of their fossil record. The fossil species is strikingly similar
   to the living Ptilocercus lowii, a species generally recognized as the
   most plesiomorphic extant treeshrew. It demonstrates that Ptilocercus
   treeshrews have undergone little evolutionary change in their morphology
   since the early Oligocene. Morphological comparisons and phylogenetic
   analysis support the long-standing idea that Ptilocercus treeshrews are
   morphologically conservative and have probably retained many characters
   present in the common stock that gave rise to archontans, which include
   primates, flying lemurs, plesiadapiforms and treeshrews. This discovery
   provides an exceptional example of slow morphological evolution in a
   mammalian group over a period of 34 million years. The persistent and
   stable tropical environment in Southeast Asia through the Cenozoic
   likely played a critical role in the survival of such a morphologically
   conservative lineage.},

Abstract = {This work describes a hybrid AC/DC Smart Grid distribution scheme
   installed at LEMUR microgrid laboratory. The control of the microgrid is
   carried out according to a hierarchical coordination considering the
   high level control. The configuration includes a microgrid (mu G)
   connected to the main utility grid (MUG) by means of a solid state
   transformer (STT). The mu G is formed by several nanogrids (nGs). All
   (nGs) are based on four wire configurations, as they are usually
   employed in AC distribution systems. However, the scheme is considered
   as a hybrid Smart Grid because the connection among different nanogrids
   and with the SST are DC connections. The SST is also equipped with a
   third port connected to a central energy storage system (CESS). The
   coordination between the different involved in the systems: the
   installed dispersed generators at nanogrid level, the nanogrids, the SST
   and the CESS has been implemented using a bottom-up hierarchical
   approach. Several configurations at nanogrid and microgrid levels are
   shown and analyzed. For making the coordination of the different
   elements of the microgrid, a fast power flow alorithm for estimating the
   state of the microgrid in real time was developed. In this paper the
   proposed structure is described paying special attention to the power
   flow algorithm. The results obtained with the power flow algorithm in
   simulations were validated at laboratory level.},

Abstract = {The poster is a description of a project to design, test, and run an
   experiment in space (Low Earth Orbit - LEO) on a CubeSat satellite
   launched by Spire Corporation in September 2015. Ardusat and the
   Association of Space Explorers sponsored a national contest to select
   fifteen schools to invent, create, and explore running custom
   experiments in space. Rachel Carson Middle School (Fairfax County Public
   School in Virginia) was awarded the opportunity to run two experiments
   (in January and March 2016) on the Lemur Satellite.
   The experiment will use the Lemur Luminosity Sensor to measure different
   frequencies and strength of infrared and ultraviolet light in space. The
   purpose of the experiment is to understand how light is affected by
   distance and spectrum of light in space. The data collected will be used
   to support satellite-to-satellite communication for a mesh space
   communication network for an array of multiple CubeSat satellites. The
   multiple satellites could use light communication as an out-of-band
   (non-Radio Frequency) communication network.
   The advantage of using infrared light communication is the high bit
   rates and low error rates. Data collection on useful distance and
   interference will be analyzed to determine the best light wave pulses
   and acceptable angles for the luminosity sensor to capture data
   adjusting for sensitivity.
   Data will be captured four times per hour over fifteen days to determine
   the different bands and wavelengths of light in space. Based on the
   data, the best bands (e.g. H, J, K, L, M bands) will be determined for
   satellite-to-satellite light communications. The team will attempt to
   determine a CubeSat constellation appropriate for a mesh network of
   satellites in low earth orbit. The model will attempt show the
   elimination of latency in communications while determining the minimum
   number of satellites needed to provide coverage of CubeSat in LEO.},

Abstract = {The golden-crowned sifaka, Propithecus tattersalli, is a critically
   endangered social lemur species that inhabits the restricted and highly
   fragmented semi-evergreen forests. In this study, we determined the
   complete mitochondrial genome sequence of this species for the first
   time. The results shows that this mtDNA genome is 17 099 bp in size, and
   comprises 22 transfer RNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal
   RNA genes, and one control region (D-loop). The overall base composition
   in descending order is A (32.91\%), C (27.07\%), T (27.04\%), and G
   (12.98\%), so the percentage of A and T (59.95\%) is slightly higher
   than that of G and C. The gene order and the composition of P.
   tattersalli mitochondrial genome are exactly similar to those of most
   other vertebrates. All the genes are encoded on the heavy strand with
   the exception of NADH dehydrogenase subunit six (ND6) and eight tRNA
   genes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the P. tattersalli exhibits
   most close relationship with P. coquereli. The complete mitochondrial
   genome sequence presented here will be useful for further phylogenetic
   analysis and conservation genetic studies in P. tattersalli.},

Abstract = {Australia's native baobab, Adansonia gregorii (F. Muell., Malvaceae:
   Bombacoideae) is the only baobab outside the African continent. Baobabs
   of the African continent have shades either of red, orange and yellow
   coloured flowers and are pollinated by insects, especially by hawkmoths
   of the Sphingidae family, or have white flowers and are pollinated by
   small mammals (e.g. bats and lemurs). In contrast, the Australian
   baobab, with white, erected flowers, was found to be mostly pollinated
   by hawkmoths. It is possible that for this white-flowered species, small
   mammals play a role in pollination. Therefore, the aim of the study was
   to identify major pollinators of the Australian baobab. Motion cameras
   were used in December 2013 and ground observations were performed in the
   flowering season of 2015-2016 to observe (potential) pollinators.
   Results show observations of hawkmoths and other insects, birds and
   sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps) pollinating the flowers. The major
   pollinator found in this study was, however, the black flying fox
   (Pteropus alecto): it was observed foraging in groups and consuming the
   anthers of the Australian baobab flowers. Pollination by megabats, as
   the black flying fox, could have played an important role in the
   evolution of the white, erect flower of Australian baobabs.},

Abstract = {In the Devonian, the Falkland Islands were part of the high-latitude
   Cape Basin. West Falkland palynological assemblages are at a low thermal
   maturity level but also very low in diversity and dominated by simple
   spores with rare chitinozoans and acritarchs. The South Harbour Member
   contains rare verrucate and sculptured trilete spores, and is early
   Lochkovian. The Fish Creek Member palynofloras are late Lochkovian. The
   best correlative datum is the transgressive Fox Bay Formation where the
   palynological assemblage includes Ramochitina magnifica and is
   equivalent to the Sequence B transgression in Brazil (dated as late
   Pragian-earliest Emsian). The early Eifelian upper Fox Bay Formation
   spore assemblage is comparable to the Sequence C transgression in Brazil
   and the ?Chotec. Event. The facies and position of the base Port
   Philomel Formation prasinophyte-rich black shale suggests the late
   Eifelian transgression (Kacak Event). Above this level is the inception
   of Geminospora lemurata (base Givetian). The upper Port Stanley
   Formation contains a late (but not latest) Famennian assemblage.
   Comparisons with both South Africa and South America indicate a number
   of correlative transgressive and regressive events that match to
   Euramerica. These correlations are at a continental scale and confirm
   eustatic control of these Devonian events.},

Abstract = {The K/P boundary, 66 Ma, was a critical time in the history of the
   planet's biota. On the island of Madagascar, few Late Cretaceous species
   survived the associated extinction, and distance from the various
   mainland sources then acted as a strong filter for the number of
   over-water arrivees. Reconstructing the climate of the early Paleogene
   is vital for understanding the environments to which new colonizers
   landed and established a toe-hold on the island. Beginning with a
   ``global{''} air-sea-coupled climate model simulation using the land-sea
   distribution at 66 Ma, we used dynamical downscaling to construct a
   scenario for how the atmospheric and oceanic fluid envelopes washed over
   and around the Madagascar at the start of the Paleocene. Dynamical
   downscaling of the global model yields a climate model with much finer
   resolution. We used this method to reconstruct the habitats for known
   fossil localities from that general period, better understand the
   ecological diversity of plants and animals that have been hypothesized
   to have then been present and evaluate hypotheses regarding the
   evolutionary history of lemurs a vast clade of primates endemic to
   Madagascar whose last common ancestor dates to this time. Our results
   show an island with a climate notably different from that of today, but
   not nearly as arid as others have suggested: the spiny thicket biome did
   not exist; temperatures were lower; rainfall less seasonal. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Magnifying optical assemblies used for weapon guidance or rifle scopes
   may possess a threat for a combat vehicle and its personnel. Detection
   and localisation of optical threats is consequently of interest in
   military applications. Typically a laser system is used in optics
   detection, or optical augmentation, to interrogate a scene of interest
   to localise retro-reflected laser radiation. One interesting approach
   for implementing optics detection on a combat vehicle is to use a
   continuous scanning scheme. In addition, optics detection can be
   combined with laser countermeasures, or a laser dazzling function, to
   efficiently counter an optical threat. An optics detection laser sensor
   demonstrator has been implemented on a combat vehicle. The sensor
   consists of a stabilised gimbal and was integrated together with a LEMUR
   remote electro-optical sight. A narrow laser slit is continuously
   scanned around the horizon to detect and locate optical threats.
   Detected threats are presented for the operator within the LEMUR
   presentation system, and by cueing a countermeasure laser installed in
   the LEMUR sensor housing threats can be defeated. Results obtained
   during a field demonstration of the optics detection sensor and the
   countermeasure laser will be presented. In addition, results obtained
   using a dual-channel optics detection system designed for false alarm
   reduction are also discussed.},

   reported the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of this species. The
   mitogenome of P. verreauxi is 17 106 bp in length and composed of 13
   protein -coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA
   genes and a control region. The structure about gene order and
   composition is identical to that of the other lemur species and related
   genera. The overall base composition of the heavy strand in descending
   order is A (32.84\%), T (27.13\%), C (26.95\%), and G (13.08\%). Most of
   the genes are encoded on the heavy strand except for the NADH
   dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6) and eight tRNA genes. With the exception
   of COX3, which terminates with an incomplete stop codon (T-), all the
   other PCGs initiates with a traditional ATN start codon and ends with
   the typical mitochondrial stop codon (TAG/TAA/AGA). The phylogenetic
   tree constructed using the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of P.
   verreauxi together with 15 other closely related species with Neighbor
   Joining (NJ) method shows that P. verreauxi is closer to P. coquereli in
   the phylogenetic relationship.},

Title = {Hibernation in the pygmy slow loris (Nycticebus pygmaeus): multiday
   torpor in primates is not restricted to Madagascar},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC 3},
Abstract = {Hibernation and short daily torpor are states of energy conservation
   with reduced metabolism and body temperature. Both hibernation, also
   called multiday torpor, and daily torpor are common among mammals and
   occur in at least 11 orders. Within the primates, there is a peculiar
   situation, because to date torpor has been almost exclusively reported
   for Malagasy lemurs. The single exception is the African lesser
   bushbaby, which is capable of daily torpor, but uses it only under
   extremely adverse conditions. For true hibernation, the geographical
   restriction was absolute. No primate outside of Madagascar was
   previously known to hibernate. Since hibernation is commonly viewed as
   an ancient, plesiomorphic trait, theoretically this could mean that
   hibernation as an overwintering strategy was lost in all other primates
   in mainland Africa, Asia, and the Americas. However, we hypothesized
   that a good candidate species for the use of hibernation, outside of
   Madagascar should be the pygmy slow loris (Nycticebus pygmaeus), a small
   primate inhabiting tropical forests. Here, we show that pygmy slow
   lorises exposed to natural climatic conditions in northern Vietnam
   during winter indeed undergo torpor lasting up to 63 h, that is,
   hibernation. Thus, hibernation has been retained in at least one primate
   outside of Madagascar.},

Abstract = {Madagascar is renowned for the loss of the forested habitat of lemurs
   and other species endemic to the island. Less well known is that in the
   highlands, a region often described as an environmental basket-case of
   fire-degraded, eroded grasslands, woody cover has been increasing for
   decades. Using information derived from publically available high- and
   medium-resolution satellites, this study characterizes tree cover
   dynamics in the highlands of Madagascar over the past two decades. Our
   results reveal heterogeneous patterns of increased tree cover on
   smallholder farms and village lands, spurred by a mix of endogenous and
   exogenous forces. The new trees play important roles in rural
   livelihoods, providing renewable supplies of firewood, charcoal, timber
   and other products and services, as well as defensible claims to land
   tenure in the context of a decline in the use of hillside commons for
   grazing. This study documents this nascent forest transition through
   Land Change Science techniques, and provides a prologue to political
   ecological analysis by setting these changes in their social and
   environmental context and interrogating the costs and benefits of the
   shift in rural livelihood strategies.},

Title = {Seasonal variation in the abundance and distribution of ticks that

Abstract = {At Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve (BMSR), Madagascar, mouse lemurs
   (Microcebus griseorufus) are parasitized by multiple species of
   haemaphysaline ticks. At present we know little about the role ticks
   play in wild lemur populations and how they can alter interspecies
   relationships within communities or impact host fitness. In order to
   better understand these dynamics at BMSR, we examined parasite-host
   interactions as well as the ecology of mouse lemurs and their infesting
   ticks, Haemaphysalis lemuris and H. sp. cf. simplex. We show that
   season, host sex, and habitat influence the relative abundance of ticks
   on mouse lemurs. Specifically, infestations occur only during the dry
   season (May-October), are higher in males, and are higher at the study
   site with the most ground cover and with greater density of largebodied
   hosts. Microcebus likely experience decreased susceptibility to tick
   infestations during the wet season because at that time they rarely if
   ever descend to the ground. Similarly, male mouse lemurs have higher
   infestation rates than females because of the greater time they spend
   traveling and foraging on the ground. During the dry season, Microcebus
   likely serve as hosts for the tenrec tick, H. sp. cf. simplex, when
   tenrecs hibernate. In turn, during the wet season when mouse lemurs
   rarely descend to the ground, other small mammals at the reserve may
   serve as maintenance hosts for populations of immature ticks. The
   synchronous development of larvae and nymphs could present high risk for
   vectorborne disease in Microcebus. This study also provides a
   preliminary description of the ecology and life cycle of the most common
   lemur tick, H. lemuris. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Title = {The vertebrate biostratigraphy of the Rousay sequence in the Middle
   Devonian of Orkney, Scotland},
Journal = {SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {51},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-156},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Biostratigraphic zones based on fossil fish are identified within the
   Middle Devonian Rousay sequence in the upper part of the main lacustrine
   sequence of Orkney. The Rousay sequence forms the majority of the
   bedrock of Orkney and the original Geological Survey had estimated its
   thickness to be over 1500 m. Some recent geological investigations have
   redefined the Rousay sequence and reduced its thickness to such an
   extent (around 200 m) that the latest (2000) BGS geological map (1: 100
   000) includes a Rousay Flagstone Member as only an upper member of the
   Upper Stromness Flagstone Formation. Our new investigations have
   confirmed that the fossil fish clearly separate the Rousay sequence from
   the underlying Stromness Flags and show that its thickness is over 800
   m. The osteolepid fish Osteolepis panderi occurs in a limited zone at
   the base of the Rousay sequence in a set of two or three fish beds with
   prolific occurrences of O. panderi and occasional specimens of the
   osteolepid fish Thursius pholidotus. Above these fish beds, O. panderi
   becomes extinct within the basin (but may have persisted outside the
   basin in the marine realm). Several fish beds containing numerous
   specimens of the coccosteid fish Millerosteus minor, again with
   occasional specimens of T. pholidotus, occur from about 205 m above the
   base of the Rousay sequence in a middle unit of the sequence. This unit
   is about 195 m thick and contains the first significant coarse to pebbly
   sandstones above the basal transgression of the main lacustrine
   sequence. Above this sandy member, these fossil fish become extinct
   within the basin (but may persist outside the basin) and then there are
   over 400 m of dominantly finer-grained lacustrine strata up to the
   overlying sandstones of the Lower Eday Sandstone Formation, the lowest
   formation of the Eday Group. Fossil fish are present in this uppermost
   part of the Rousay sequence, but do not include Osteolepis panderi or
   Millerosteus milleri and instead are dominantly of species with long
   ranges in the flagstone sequence. A poorly defined biozone containing
   rare individuals of the antiarch, Asterolepis orcadensis, occurs in a
   limited interval near the top of the lacustrine sequence. Based on the
   identification of these biozones and their relationship to distinct
   sedimentary units, we have provisionally identified within the Rousay
   sequence Lower, Middle and Upper Rousay units, but these are not
   formally defined as formations.
   These biostratigraphic zones can be correlated in the equivalent
   sequence in Caithness, except for the uppermost Asterolepis orcadensis
   zone probably because the transition between the lacustrine sequence and
   the overlying sandstones is not exposed. Equivalent biostratigraphic
   units, provisionally identified as the Thurso Flagstones, Mey and Huna
   units, can be directly related in upward sequence to the units
   recognized on Orkney. By comparison with the position of the first
   appearance of the spore Geminospora lemurata, which marks the base of
   the Givetian, the Eifelian/Givetian boundary is interpreted to lie above
   the Millerosteus minor Biozone.},

Title = {Distinct functional roles of primate grasping hands and feet during
   arboreal quadrupedal locomotion},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {79-84},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {It has long been thought that quadrupedal primates successfully occupy
   arboreal environments, in part, by relying on their grasping feet to
   control balance and propulsion, which frees their hands to test unstable
   branches and forage. If this interlimb decoupling of function is real,
   there should be discernible differences in forelimb versus hind limb
   musculoskeletal control, specifically in how manual and pedal digital
   flexor muscles are recruited to grasp during arboreal locomotion. New
   electromyography data from extrinsic flexor muscles in red ruffed lemurs
   (Varecia rubra) walking on a simulated arboreal substrate reveal that
   toe flexors are activated at relatively higher levels and for longer
   durations than finger flexors during stance phase. This demonstrates
   that the extremities of primates indeed have different functional roles
   during arboreal locomotion, with the feet emphasizing maintenance of
   secure grips. When this dichotomous muscle activity pattern between the
   forelimbs and hind limbs is coupled with other features of primate
   quadrupedal locomotion, including greater hind limb weight support and
   the use of diagonal-sequence footfall patterns, a complex suite of
   biomechanical characters emerges in primates that allow for the
   co-option of hands toward non-locomotor roles. Early selection for limb
   functional differentiation in primates probably aided the evolution of
   fine manipulation capabilities in the hands of bipedal humans. (C) 2015

Title = {Primates as Predictors of Mammal Community Diversity in the Forest
   Ecosystems of Madagascar},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {The geographic distribution of species is the typical metric for
   identifying priority areas for conservation. Since most biodiversity
   remains poorly studied, a subset of charismatic species, such as
   primates, often stand as surrogates for total biodiversity. A central
   question is therefore, how effectively do primates predict the pooled
   species richness of other mammalian taxa? We used lemurs as indicator
   species to predict total non-primate mammal community richness in the
   forest ecosystems of Madagascar. We combine environmental and species
   occurrence data to ascertain the extent to which primate diversity can
   predict (1) non-primate mammal alpha-diversity (species richness), (2)
   non-primate complementarity, and (3) non-primate beta-diversity (species
   turnover). Our results indicate that primates are effective predictors
   of non-primate mammal community diversity in the forest ecosystems of
   Madagascar after controlling for habitat. When individual orders of
   mammals are considered, lemurs effectively predict the species richness
   of carnivorans and rodents (but not afrosoricids), complementarity of
   rodents (but not carnivorans or afrosoricids), and all individual
   components of beta-diversity. We conclude that lemurs effectively
   predict total non-primate community richness. However, surrogate species
   alone cannot achieve complete representation of biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Probabilistic logic programming can be used to model domains with
   complex and uncertain relationships among entities. While the problem of
   learning the parameters of such programs has been considered by various
   authors, the problem of learning the structure is yet to be explored in
   depth. In this work we present an approximate search method based on a
   one-player game approach, called LEMUR. It sees the problem of learning
   the structure of a probabilistic logic program as a multi-armed bandit
   problem, relying on the Monte-Carlo tree search UCT algorithm that
   combines the precision of tree search with the generality of random

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Analysis of the only complete early cercopithecoid (Old World monkey)
   endocast currently known, that of 15-million-year (Myr)-old
   Victoriapithecus, reveals an unexpectedly small endocranial volume (ECV)
   relative to body size and a large olfactory bulb volume relative to ECV,
   similar to extant lemurs and Oligocene anthropoids. However, the
   Victoriapithecus brain has principal and arcuate sulci of the frontal
   lobe not seen in the stem catarrhine Aegyptopithecus, as well as a
   distinctive cercopithecoid pattern of gyrification, indicating that
   cerebral complexity preceded encephalization in cercopithecoids. Since
   larger ECVs, expanded frontal lobes, and reduced olfactory bulbs are
   already present in the 17-to 18-Myr-old ape Proconsul these features
   evolved independently in hominoids (apes) and cercopithecoids and much
   earlier in the former. Moreover, the order of encephalization and brain
   reorganization was apparently different in hominoids and
   cercopithecoids, showing that brain size and cerebral organization
   evolve independently.},

Abstract = {Studies on species distribution models evaluate the reliability and

   component of the data is often disregarded. The objective of our work
   was to design and validate an index, the Geo-referencing Reliability
   Index (GRI), to measure and compare quality of different databases
   containing presence data of Aotus species. The database of A. lemurinus
   showed the highest georeferencing accuracy (GRI = 0.608) and that of A.
   zonalis the lowest (GRI = 0.167). Results indicated that there is
   poor-quality spatial information data for Aotus spp. Therefore, the
   distribution areas of all species should be more accurately established
   to evaluate whether they are at conservation risk. In addition, the
   index can be used to select the most accurate spatial data for
   constructing a species distribution model. Finally, we strongly believe
   that the GRI may provide accurate, up-to-date information essential for

Title = {Screams in the Night: Pilot Study Reveals Moderate Evidence for

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3},
Pages = {666-678},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Social complexity is argued to be a driving factor in the evolution of
   communicative complexity. Complex social systems require individuals to
   form relationships with many conspecifics and interact in a wide variety
   of contexts over time, thus selecting for acoustic communication systems
   complex enough to facilitate these relationships. To better understand
   the evolution of such social and communicative complexity, we
   investigated a nocturnal, solitary forager, Garnett's bushbaby (Otolemur
   garnettii), as a lorisoid model for the ancestral primate social systems
   from which more complex systems evolved. We hypothesized that it would
   be advantageous for solitary foragers to have individual differences in
   long-distance calls, as this could be crucial to the maintenance of
   their dispersed social networks. We tested for individual differences in
   the long distance bark vocalization. We measured 6 frequency and
   temporal parameters for 120 barks (15 barks from each of 8 individuals
   housed at the University of SouthernMississippi). Principal component
   and discriminant function analyses assigned the calls to the respective
   individuals at a rate that was moderately accurate and higher than
   chance (binomial test: 54.2\% correct, P < 0.001, chance = 12.5\%). This
   pilot work provides moderate evidence for individual differences and is
   the first such study to be conducted on lorisoids. Because individual
   differences have been documented in the vocalizations of solitary
   foraging lemuroids, we suggest that moderate individual differences may
   have been present in ancestral primates and contributed to the dispersed
   social system that is thought to have been the foundation from which
   increased social complexity evolved in primates.},

Title = {Incorporating Ecology and Social System Into Formal Hypotheses to Guide

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {77},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {The X-linked gene polymorphism responsible for the variable color vision
   of most Neotropical monkeys and some lemurs is thought to be maintained
   by balancing selection, such that trichromats have an advantage over
   dichromats for some ecologically important task(s). However, evidence
   for such an advantage in wild primate populations is equivocal. The
   purpose of this study is to refine a hypothesis for a trichromat
   advantage by tailoring it to the ecology of territorial primates with
   female natal dispersal, such that dispersing trichromatic females have a
   foraging and, by extension, survival advantage over dichromats. I then
   examine the most practical way to test this hypothesis using field data.
   Indirect evidence in support of the hypothesis may take the form of
   differences in genotype frequencies among life stages and differences in
   disperser food item encounter rates. A deterministic evolutionary matrix
   population model and a stochastic model of food patch encounter rates
   are constructed to investigate the magnitude of such differences and the
   likelihood of statistical detection using field data. Results suggest
   that, although the sampling effort required to detect the hypothesized
   genotype frequency differences is impractical, a field study of
   reasonable scope may be able to detect differences in disperser foraging
   rates. This study demonstrates the utility of incorporating
   socioecological details into formal hypotheses during the planning
   stages of field studies of primate color vision. Am. J. Primatol.

Title = {Is evolutionary biology becoming too politically correct? A reflection
   on the scala naturae, phylogenetically basal clades, anatomically
   plesiomorphic taxa, and `lower' animals},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {90},
Number = {2},
Pages = {502-521},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The notion of scala naturae dates back to thinkers such as Aristotle,
   who placed plants below animals and ranked the latter along a graded
   scale of complexity from `lower' to `higher' animals, such as humans. In
   the last decades, evolutionary biologists have tended to move from one
   extreme (i.e. the idea of scala naturae or the existence of a general
   evolutionary trend in complexity from `lower' to ``higher{''} taxa, with
   Homo sapiens as the end stage) to the other, opposite, extreme (i.e. to
   avoid using terms such as `phylogenetically basal' and `anatomically
   plesiomorphic' taxa, which are seen as the undesired vestige of old
   teleological theories). The latter view tries to avoid any possible
   connotations with the original anthropocentric idea of a scala naturae
   crowned by man and, in that sense, it can be regarded as a more
   politically correct view. In the past years and months there has been
   renewed interest in these topics, which have been discussed in various
   papers and monographs that tend to subscribe, in general, to the points
   defended in the more politically correct view. Importantly, most
   evolutionary and phylogenetic studies of tetrapods and other
   vertebrates, and therefore most discussions on the scala naturae and
   related issues have been based on hard tissue and, more recently, on
   molecular data. Here we provide the first discussion of these topics
   based on a comparative myological study of all the major vertebrate
   clades and of myological cladistic and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of
   bony fish and tetrapods, including Primates. We specifically (i)
   contradict the notions of a scala naturae or evolutionary progressive
   trends leading to more complexity in `higher' animals and culminating in
   Homo sapiens, and (ii) stress that the refutation of these old notions
   does not necessarily mean that one should not keep using the terms
   `phylogenetically basal' and particularly `anatomically plesiomorphic'
   to refer to groups such as the urodeles within the Tetrapoda, or the
   strepsirrhines and lemurs within the Primates, for instance. This review
   will contribute to improving our understanding of these broad
   evolutionary issues and of the evolution of the vertebrate Bauplans, and
   hopefully will stimulate future phylogenetic, evolutionary and
   developmental studies of these clades.},

Title = {Abiotic constraints on the activity of tropical lizards},
Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},
Number = {5},
Pages = {694-700},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Many tropical ectotherms are considered vulnerable to anthropogenic
   climate change because they have evolved to become thermal specialists.
   Indeed, several recent studies have suggested that even small increases
   in mean operative temperature may lead to a reduction in activity and
   the subsequent extinction of populations. Within the tropics, lizards
   are considered particularly vulnerable due to the potential for climate
   change to directly impact physiology and alter community interactions.
   However, models usually focus on the effects of mean operative
   temperature at the expense of other climate variables that may also
   affect lizard physiology. We used daily variation in operative
   temperature, humidity and wind speed to examine how changes in climate
   influence activity in two species of lizards from the island of Cayo
   Menor, Honduras. Anolis lemurinus is a forest species, whereas
   A.allisoni is an open-habitat species. We conducted daily surveys for
   active lizards in habitat typical to each species, while simultaneously
   measuring operative thermal environments with physical models. The
   effects of the thermal environment were considered in the context of the
   thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance for each species and
   compared with the effects of the hydric (humidity) and convective (wind)
   environments. When all surveys were combined into a single analysis, the
   activity of the forest species Anolis lemurinus was positively
   correlated with wind speed, the spatial heterogeneity of operative
   temperature, and the mismatch between mean operative temperature and the
   optimal temperature for sprint performance. Mean operative temperature
   did significantly affect Anolis lemurinus activity, but only when it was
   above their thermal optimum. Activity of the open-habitat species
   A.allisoni was negatively correlated with wind speed, but was not
   related to any other climate variable. Whereas the mismatch between mean
   operative temperature and the thermal optimum for performance predicted
   the activity level of the forest species in ways partially consistent
   with its use in models for the response of lizards to climate change,
   the effects of the abiotic environment were habitat dependent. Our
   results suggest that successfully predicting the biological impacts of
   climate change will require holistic models that account for more than
   changes in mean temperature alone.},

Title = {Opposite effects of male and female helpers on social tolerance and
   proactive prosociality in callitrichid family groups},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Month = {APR 16},
Abstract = {Across a broad variety of primate species (including lemurs, New World
   monkeys, Old World monkeys, and apes), proactive prosociality and social
   tolerance are linked to allomaternal care, reaching the highest levels
   in the cooperatively breeding callitrichid monkeys and humans. However,
   considerable variation exists within callitrichids, and the aim of this
   study was to identify factors that explain this variation. Male and
   female callitrichids pursue different reproductive strategies, leading
   males to play a more prominent role in allomothering. We thus
   hypothesised that prosociality and tolerance may be affected by group
   composition and sex differences. We analysed social tolerance and
   proactive prosociality data in 49 common marmosets and found that the
   number of female helpers in a group was negatively correlated with
   group-level prosociality and tolerance. At the individual level, rearing
   experience or age enhanced prosociality in male, but not in female
   helpers. These findings are consistent with the more ambivalent role of
   female helpers in infant rearing. Adding data from 5 cotton-top and 5
   lion tamarins strengthened this pattern. The same factor which explains
   variation in prosociality and tolerance across primate species, i.e.
   allomaternal care, is therefore also linked to variation within common
   marmosets, and presumably callitrichid monkeys in general.},

Volume = {370},

Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {We here review the evolution of invasive placentation in primates
   towards the deep penetration of the endometrium and its arteries in
   hominoids. The strepsirrhine primates (lemurs and lorises) have
   non-invasive, epitheliochorial placentation, although this is thought to
   be derived from a more invasive type. In haplorhine primates, there is
   differentiation of trophoblast at the blastocyst stage into syncytial
   and cellular trophoblast. Implantation involves syncytiotrophoblast that
   first removes the uterine epithelium then consolidates at the basal
   lamina before continuing into the stroma. In later stages of pregnancy,
   especially in Old World monkeys and apes, cytotrophoblast plays a
   greater role in the invasive process. Columns of trophoblast cells
   advance to the base of the implantation site where they spread out to
   forma cytotrophoblastic shell. In addition, cytotrophoblasts advance
   into the lumen of the spiral arteries. They are responsible for
   remodelling these vessels to form wide, low-resistance conduits. In
   human and great apes, there is additional invasion of the endometrium
   and its vessels by trophoblasts originating from the base of the
   anchoring villi. Deep trophoblast invasion that extends remodelling of
   the spiral arteries to segments in the inner myometrium evolved in the
   common ancestor of gorilla, chimp and human.},

Title = {Contrasting genetic diversity and population structure among three

Abstract = {Understanding the relative contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic
   factors to population structure and genetic diversity is a central goal
   of conservation and evolutionary genetics. One way to achieve this is
   through comparative population genetic analysis of sympatric sister
   taxa, which allows evaluation of intrinsic factors such as population
   demography and life history while controlling for phylogenetic
   relatedness and geography. We used ten conserved microsatellites to
   explore the population structure and genetic diversity of three
   sympatric and closely related plover species in southwestern Madagascar:
   Kittlitz's plover (Charadrius pecuarius), white-fronted plover
   (C.marginatus), and Madagascar plover (C.thoracicus). Bayesian
   clustering revealed strong population structure in the rare and endemic
   Madagascar plover, intermediate population structure in the
   white-fronted plover, and no detectable population structure in the
   geographically widespread Kittlitz's plover. In contrast, allelic
   richness and heterozygosity were highest for the Kittlitz's plover,
   intermediate for the white-fronted plover and lowest for the Madagascar
   plover. No evidence was found in support of the watershed mechanism
   proposed to facilitate vicariant divergence of Madagascan lemurs and
   reptiles, which we attribute to the vagility of birds. However, we found
   a significant pattern of genetic isolation by distance among populations
   of the Madagascar plover, but not for the other two species. These
   findings suggest that interspecific variation in rarity, endemism, and
   dispersal propensity may influence genetic structure and diversity, even
   in highly vagile species.},

Abstract = {Only a few studies based on single locus characterization have been
   conducted on the molecular epidemiology of Giardia duodenalis in
   nonhuman primates (NHPs). The present study was conducted to examine the
   occurrence and genotype identity of G. duodenalis in NHPs based on
   multi-locus analysis of the small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA),
   triose phosphate isomerase (tpi), glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), and
   beta-giardin (bg) genes. Fecal specimens were collected from 496 animals
   of 36 NHP species kept in seven zoos in China and screened for G.
   duodenalis by tpi-based PCR. G. duodenalis was detected in 92(18.6\%)
   specimens from 18 NHP species, belonging to assemblage A (n = 4) and B
   (n = 88). In positive NHP species, the infection rates ranged from 4.8\%
   to 100\%. In tpi sequence analysis, the assemblage A included subtypes
   A1, A2 and one novel subtype. Multi-locus analysis of the tpi, gdh, and
   bg genes detected 11 (8 known and 3 new), 6 (3 known and 3 new) and 9 (2
   known and 7 new) subtypes in 88, 47 and 35 isolates in assemblage B,
   respectively. Thirty-two assemblage B isolates with data at all three
   loci yielded 15 multi-locus genotypes (MLGs), including 2 known and 13
   new MLGs. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences of assemblage
   B showed that MLGs found here were genetically different from those of
   humans. NHPs, rabbit and guinea pig in Italy and Sweden. It further
   indicated that assemblage B isolates in ring-tailed lemurs and squirrel
   monkeys might be genetically different from those in other NHPs. These
   data suggest that NHPs are mainly infected with G. duodenalis assemblage
   B and there might be geographical segregation and host-adaptation in
   assemblage B in NHPs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Viral metagenomics sequencing of fecal samples from outbreaks of acute
   gastroenteritis from the US revealed the presence of small circular
   ssDNA viral genomes encoding a replication initiator protein (Rep).
   Viral genomes were similar to 2.5 kb in length, with bi-directionally
   oriented Rep and capsid (Cap) encoding genes and a stem loop structure
   downstreamof Rep. Several genomes showed evidence of recombination. By
   digital screening of an in-house virome database (1.04 billion reads)
   using BLAST, we identified closely related sequences from cases of
   unexplained diarrhea in France. Deep sequencing and PCR detected such
   genomes in 7 of 25 US (28 percent) and 14 of 21 French outbreaks (67
   percent). One of eighty-five sporadic diarrhea cases in the Gambia was
   positive by PCR. Twenty-two complete genomes were characterized showing
   that viruses from patients in the same outbreaks were closely related
   suggesting common origins. Similar genomes were also characterized from
   the stools of captive chimpanzees, a gorilla, a black howler monkey, and
   a lemur that were more diverse than the human stool-associated genomes.
   The name smacovirus is proposed for this monophyletic viral clade.
   Possible tropism include mammalian enteric cells or ingested food
   components such as infected plants. No evidence of viral amplification
   was found in immunodeficient mice orally inoculated with smacovirus-
   positive stool supernatants. A role for smacoviruses in diarrhea, if
   any, remains to be demonstrated.},

Abstract = {A fern from the French PyreneesxCystocarpium roskamianumis a recently
   formed intergeneric hybrid between parental lineages that diverged from
   each other approximately 60 million years ago (mya; 95\% highest
   posterior density: 40.2-76.2 mya). This is an extraordinarily deep
   hybridization event, roughly akin to an elephant hybridizing with a
   manatee or a human with a lemur. In the context of other reported deep
   hybrids, this finding suggests that populations of ferns, and other
   plants with abiotically mediated fertilization, may evolve reproductive
   incompatibilities more slowly, perhaps because they lack many of the
   premating isolation mechanisms that characterize most other groups of
   organisms. This conclusion implies that major features of Earth's
   biodiversitysuch as the relatively small number of species of ferns
   compared to those of angiospermsmay be, in part, an indirect by-product
   of this slower speciation clock rather than a direct consequence of
   adaptive innovations by the more diverse lineages.},

Abstract = {The well-accepted Euarchonta grandorder is a pruned version of Archonta
   nested within the Euarchontoglires (or Supraprimates) clade. At present,
   it includes tree shrews (Scandentia), flying lemurs (Dermoptera) and
   primates (Primates). Here, a phylogenomic dataset containing 1912 exons
   from 22 representative mammals was compiled to investigate the
   phylogenetic relationships within this group. Phylogenetic analyses and
   hypothesis testing suggested that tree shrews can be classified as a
   sister group to Primates or to Glires or even as a basal clade within
   Euarchontoglires. Further analyses of both modified and original
   previously published datasets found that the phylogenetic position of
   tree shrews is unstable. We also found that two of three exonic indels
   reported as synapomorphies of Euarchonta in a previous study do not
   unambiguously support the monophyly of such a clade. Therefore, the
   monophyly of both Euarchonta and Sundatheria (Dermoptera + Scandentia)
   are suspect. Molecular dating and divergence rate analyses suggested
   that the ancestor of Euarchontoglires experienced a rapid divergence,
   which may cause the unresolved position of tree shrews even using the
   whole genomic data.},

   Significance},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {To appreciate the genetic diversity and zoonotic implications of
   Enterocytozoon bieneusi in nonhuman primates (NHPs) in zoos, we
   genotyped E. bieneusi in captive NHPs in seven zoos located at six major
   cities in China, using ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS)based
   PCR and sequence analyses. A total of 496 fecal specimens from 36 NHP
   species under nine families were analyzed and E. bieneusi was detected
   in 148 (29.8\%) specimens of 25 NHP species from six families, including
   Cercopithecidae (28.7\%), Cebidae (38.0\%), Aotidae (75.0\%), Lemuridae
   (26.0\%), Hylobatidae (50.0\%) and Hominidae (16.2\%) (P = 0.0605). The
   infection rates were 29.0\%, 15.2\%, 18.2\%, 37.3\%, 29.2\%, 37.7\% and
   44.8\% in Shijiazhuang Zoo, Wuhan Zoo, Taiyuan Zoo, Changsha Wild Animal
   Zoo, Beijing Zoo, Shanghai Zoo and Shanghai Wild Animal Park,
   respectively (P = 0.0146). A total of 25 ITS genotypes were found: 14
   known (D, O, EbpC, EbpA, Type IV, Henan-IV, BEB6, BEB4, Peru8,
   PigEBITS5, EbpD, CM1, CM4 and CS-1) and 11 new (CM8 to CM18). Genotype D
   was the most prevalent one (40/148), followed by CM4 (20/148), CM1
   (15/148), O (13/148), CM16 (13/148), EbpC (11/148). Of them, genotypes
   D, EbpC, CM4 and O were widely distributed in NHPs (seen in 9 to 12
   species) whereas genotypes CM1 and CM16 were restricted to one to three
   NHP species. In phylogenetic analysis, 20 genotypes (121/148, 81.8\%),
   excluding genotypes BEB4, BEB6, CM9, CM4 and CM18, belonged to group 1
   with zoonotic potential. New genotype CM9 clustered in group 2 with BEB4
   and BEB6. The remaining two genotypes CM4 and CM18 formed new cluster
   (group 9) in between two other genotypic clusters found in primates. The
   findings of high diversity in E. bieneusi genotypes and their zoonotic
   potentiality concluded the importance of captive NHPs as reservoir hosts
   for human microsporidiosis.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {370},
Number = {1662},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {There is increased evidence that incorporating evolutionary history
   directly in conservation actions is beneficial, particularly given the
   likelihood that extinction is not random and that phylogenetic diversity
   (PD) is lost at higher rates than species diversity. This evidence is
   even more compelling in biodiversity hotspots, such as Madagascar, where
   less than 10\% of the original vegetation remains. Here, we use the
   Leguminosae, an ecologically and economically important plant family,
   and a combination of phylogenetics and species distribution modelling,
   to assess biodiversity patterns and identify regions, coevolutionary
   processes and ecological factors that are important in shaping this
   diversity, especially during the Quaternary. We show evidence that
   species distribution and community PD are predicted by watershed
   boundaries, which enable the identification of a network of refugia and
   dispersal corridors that were perhaps important for maintaining
   community integrity during past climate change. Phylogenetically
   clustered communities are found in the southwest of the island at low
   elevation and share a suite of morphological characters (especially
   fruit morphology) indicative of coevolution with their main dispersers,
   the extinct and extant lemurs. Phylogenetically over-dispersed
   communities are found along the eastern coast at sea level and may have
   resulted from many independent dispersal events from the drier and more
   seasonal regions of Madagascar.},

Title = {Identification of apple miRNAs and their potential role in fire blight
   resistance},
Journal = {TREE GENETICS \& GENOMES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key players in multiple biological processes;
   therefore, analysis and characterization of these small regulatory RNAs
   is a critical step toward a better understanding of animal and plant
   biology. In apple (Malus domestica), 200 microRNAs are known, which most
   probably represent only a fraction of miRNAome diversity. As a result,
   more effort is required to better annotate miRNAs and their functions in
   this economically important species. We performed deep sequencing of 12
   small RNA libraries obtained for fire blight-resistant and fire
   blight-sensitive trees. In the sequencing results, we identified 116
   novel microRNAs and confirmed a majority of previously reported apple
   miRNAs. We then experimentally verified selected candidates with RTPCR
   and stem-loop quantitative PCR (qPCR) and performed differential
   expression analysis. Finally, we identified and characterized putative
   targets of all known apple miRNAs. The gene ontology (GO) enrichment
   analysis suggests prominent roles of miRNAs in response to stresses,
   including pathogen infection. In this study, we identified 116 new and
   confirmed the expression of 143 already known miRNAs. Moreover, our data
   suggests that apple microRNAs might be considered as regulators and
   markers of fire blight resistance. The analyses we performed allowed us
   to define four apple miRNAs potentially involved in fire blight
   resistance in apple trees: mdm-miR169a, mdm-miR160e, mdm-miR167b-g, and
   mdm-miR168a,b. These miRNAs are known to be involved in response to
   stresses across other plant species, usually by targeting stress
   response proteins. The relatively low number of candidates may result
   from the high variance of biological replicates and the fact that stress
   response miRNAs are usually induced by the stress factors and frequently
   expressed at a low level, or not expressed at all, in normal conditions.
   The results of our studies are freely available in an online database at

Abstract = {Although parasitic organisms are found worldwide, the relative
   importance of host specificity and geographic isolation for parasite
   speciation has been explored in only a few systems. Here, we study
   Plasmodium parasites known to infect Asian nonhuman primates, a
   monophyletic group that includes the lineage leading to the human
   parasite Plasmodium vivax and several species used as laboratory models
   in malaria research. We analyze the available data together with new
   samples from three sympatric primate species from Borneo: The Bornean
   orangutan and the long-tailed and the pig-tailed macaques. We find
   several species of malaria parasites, including three putatively new
   species in this biodiversity hotspot. Among those newly discovered
   lineages, we report two sympatric parasites in orangutans. We find no
   differences in the sets of malaria species infecting each macaque
   species indicating that these species show no host specificity. Finally,
   phylogenetic analysis of these data suggests that the malaria parasites
   infecting Southeast Asian macaques and their relatives are speciating
   three to four times more rapidly than those with other mammalian hosts
   such as lemurs and African apes. We estimate that these events took
   place in approximately a 3-4-Ma period. Based on the genetic and
   phenotypic diversity of the macaque malarias, we hypothesize that the
   diversification of this group of parasites has been facilitated by the
   diversity, geographic distributions, and demographic histories of their
   primate hosts.},

Abstract = {The non-human primate reference transcriptome resource (NHPRTR,
   available online at http://nhprtr.org/)aims to generate comprehensive
   RNA-seq data from a wide variety of non-human primates (NHPs), from
   lemurs to hominids. In the 2012 Phase I of the NHPRTR project, 19
   billion fragments or 3.8 terabases of transcriptome sequences were
   collected from pools of similar to 20 tissues in 15 species and
   subspecies. Here we describe a major expansion of NHPRTR by adding 10.1
   billion fragments of tissue-specific RNA-seq data. For this effort, we
   selected 11 of the original 15 NHP species and subspecies and
   constructed total RNA libraries for the same similar to 15 tissues in
   each. The sequence quality is such that 88\% of the reads align to human
   reference sequences, allowing us to compute the full list of expression
   abundance across all tissues for each species, using the reads mapped to
   human genes. This update also includes improved transcript annotations
   derived from RNA-seq data for rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, two of the
   most commonly used NHP models and additional RNA-seq data compiled from
   related projects. Together, these comprehensive reference transcriptomes
   from multiple primates serve as a valuable community resource for genome
   annotation, gene dynamics and comparative functional analysis.},

Journal = {FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL-GENETICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {96-107},
Abstract = {Sex-testing using molecular genetic technique is routinely used in the
   fields of forensics, population genetics and conservation biology.
   However, none of the assay used so far allows a non-ambiguous and
   successful sex determination for human and non-human primate species.
   The most widely used method, AMELY/X, and its alternatives suffer from a
   set of drawbacks in humans and can rarely be used in New World primate
   species. Here, we designed a new sex-typing assay using a multiplexed
   PCR amplification of UTX and UTY-homologous loci and combined
   male-specific SRY locus. This method was successfully tested on 1048
   samples, including 82 non-human primates from 45 Anthropoidea and
   Lemuriformes species and 966 human samples from 24 populations
   (Africans, Europeans, and South Americans). This sex-typing method is
   applicable across all primate species tested from Hominoidea to
   Indriidae, and also on various populations with different background
   origins; it represents a robust and cheap sex-typing assay to be used
   both by the anthropologist and primatologist communities. (C) 2014

Title = {Significance of the Evolutionary alpha 1,3-Galactosyltransferase (GGTA1)
   Gene Inactivation in Preventing Extinction of Apes and Old World Monkeys},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION},

Volume = {80},

Abstract = {The alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase (alpha 1,3GT or GGTA1) gene displays
   unique evolutionary characteristics. This gene appeared early in
   mammalian evolution and is absent in other vertebrates. The alpha 1,3GT
   gene is active in marsupials, nonprimate placental mammals, lemurs
   (prosimians) and New World monkeys, encoding the alpha 1,3GT enzyme that
   synthesizes a carbohydrate antigen called ``alpha-gal epitope.{''} The
   alpha-gal epitope is present in large numbers on cell membrane
   glycolipids and glycoproteins. The alpha 1,3GT gene was inactivated in
   ancestral Old World monkeys and apes by frameshift single-base deletions
   forming premature stop codons. Because of this gene inactivation,
   humans, apes, and Old World monkeys lack alpha-gal epitopes and
   naturally produce an antibody called the ``anti-Gal antibody{''} which
   binds specifically to alpha-gal epitopes and which is the most abundant
   antibody in humans. The evolutionary event that resulted in the
   inactivation of the alpha 1,3GT gene in ancestral Old World primates
   could have been mediated by a pathogen endemic to Eurasia-Africa
   landmass that exerted pressure for selection of primate populations
   lacking the alpha-gal epitope. Once the alpha-gal epitope was
   eliminated, primates could produce the anti-Gal antibody, possibly as
   means of defense against pathogens expressing this epitope. This
   assumption is supported by the fossil record demonstrating an almost
   complete extinction of apes in the late Miocene and failure of Old World
   monkeys to radiate into multiple species before that period. A present
   outcome of this evolutionary event is the anti-Gal-mediated rejection of
   mammalian xenografts expressing alpha-gal epitopes in humans, apes, and
   Old World monkeys.},

Abstract = {Lentiviruses infect a wide range of mammal species. Much remains unknown
   about their deep history and host distribution. Here, we report the
   discovery of an endogenous lentivirus within the genome of the Sunda
   flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus) (which we designate ``Galeopterus
   variegatus endogenous lentivirus{''} {[}GvaELV]). We estimate the GvaELV
   genome invasion to have occurredmore than 14 Ma, supporting an ancient
   origin of the lentivirus clade and an ancient lentiviral infection in
   colugo. Phylogenetic analyses show that GvaELV is a sister group of all
   previously known lentiviruses. The GvaELV genome appears to possess some
   primitive genomic features of a lentivirus, encoding not only a
   trans-activator of transcription (tat) gene but also two additional
   putative accessory genes that share no discernible similarity with other
   lentiviral accessory genes. The discovery of GvaELV provides novel
   insights into the prehistory and host distribution of lentivirus.},

Abstract = {Female-biased juvenile interest in infants is common in primates.
   Proposed hypotheses to explain juvenile infant interest are that it
   helps immature individuals learn to parent, is a by-product of selection
   on adult infant care behavior, is kin-selected cooperative rearing, or
   is a form of harassment. If juvenile infant interest is associated with
   adult infant care, either functionally or as a by-product, sex-biased
   patterns of juvenile infant interest and adult infant care should show
   correlated evolution; if juvenile infant interest functions as
   cooperative rearing or harassment, they should not. Comparisons of
   nested bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo models of independent and
   dependent evolution of juvenile infant interest and adult infant care
   indicate strong support for co-evolution of juvenile infant interest and
   adult infant care. Expanding comparative analysis to include available
   data from lemurs strengthens this support, suggesting that the function
   of juvenile infant interest does not differ between strepsirrhines and
   haplorhines. As such, strepsirrhine taxa currently maintained in
   captivity will be particularly useful in future work aiming to test
   between the learning to parent and by-product hypotheses for juvenile
   infant interest. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {This paper represents flexible power flow toolbox based on Matlab tools
   able to simulate balanced electrical networks with embedded flexible AC
   transmission devices (FACTS). The toolbox is designed to be flexible and
   able to handle standard data format for exchanging input and output with
   other software tools. The active power dispatch can be solved based on
   three mode Conventional, Optimal and Droop Control. The solver setting
   and case parameters are organised in single structure to be flexible for
   configuration and easy for exchange. New data file format is proposed to
   encapsulate all cases information in single file. The solver is
   implemented to solve multiple cases of demand variation by single call.
   This can be used to automate the analysis process and minimise the
   iteration time. The mathematical model can be selected to be based on
   admittance matrix or incident matrix methods which can be used to
   compare the performance of the two models. The IEEE test cases have been
   used to verify the solver accuracy and performance relative to
   alternative commercial and scientific tools. The solver is released as
   open source project to support additional functionality and full
   customisation for scientific research. The toolbox can be downloaded
   from LEMUR Project Research Group web page {[}1].},

Abstract = {Here we applied phylogenetically based conservation analyses using a
   novel multivariate approach to better evaluate the effects of human land
   use on different primate lineages worldwide. Using a 1' x 1' grid, we
   obtained information on primate species distribution and the cover of
   six land use categories (Urban, Village, Cropland, Rangeland,
   Seminatural and Wild). We synthesized the phylogenetic composition into
   principal coordinates of phylogenetic structure. We correlated
   phylogenetic composition and land use in each region, and assessed
   statistical significance via null model. In America, the Atelidae clade
   was associated to areas with larger coverage of villages whereas
   Pitheciidae was found on areas with higher cover of wildlands. Moreover,
   we found some Atelidae, Callitrichidae and Pitheciidae species to be
   associated with seminatural areas, while other Alouatta and Callicebus
   species were more related with higher coverage of rangelands. In
   Madagascar, Lemuridae was negatively associated with wild areas. Africa
   did not show any statistically significant association between clades
   and land use. Asia had an intense association of some Cercopithecidae
   species with high coverage of villages. Primate lineages are currently
   facing different land use pressures, which would imply in the need of
   clade-specific conservation planning. (C) 2014 Associacao Brasileira de

Abstract = {Bacterial communities colonizing the reproductive tracts of primates
   (including humans) impact the health, survival and fitness of the host,
   and thereby the evolution of the host species. Despite their importance,
   we currently have a poor understanding of primate microbiomes. The
   composition and structure of microbial communities vary considerably
   depending on the host and environmental factors. We conducted
   comparative analyses of the primate vaginal microbiome using
   pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA genes of a phylogenetically broad range
   of primates to test for factors affecting the diversity of primate
   vaginal ecosystems. The nine primate species included: humans (Homo
   sapiens), yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus), olive baboons (Papio
   anubis), lemurs (Propithecus diadema), howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra),
   red colobus (Piliocolobus rufomitratus), vervets (Chlorocebus aethiops),
   mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Our
   results indicated that all primates exhibited host-specific vaginal
   microbiota and that humans were distinct from other primates in both
   microbiome composition and diversity. In contrast to the gut microbiome,
   the vaginal microbiome showed limited congruence with host phylogeny,
   and neither captivity nor diet elicited substantial effects on the
   vaginal microbiomes of primates. Permutational multivariate analysis of
   variance and Wilcoxon tests revealed correlations among vaginal
   microbiota and host species-specific socioecological factors,
   particularly related to sexuality, including: female promiscuity,
   baculum length, gestation time, mating group size and neonatal birth
   weight. The proportion of unclassified taxa observed in nonhuman primate
   samples increased with phylogenetic distance from humans, indicative of
   the existence of previously unrecognized microbial taxa. These findings
   contribute to our understanding of host-microbe variation and
   coevolution, microbial biogeography, and disease risk, and have
   important implications for the use of animal models in studies of human
   sexual and reproductive diseases.},

Title = {Seance: reference-based phylogenetic analysis for 18S rRNA studies},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {Background: Marker gene studies often use short amplicons spanning one
   or more hypervariable regions from an rRNA gene to interrogate the
   community structure of uncultured environmental samples. Target regions
   are chosen for their discriminatory power, but the limited phylogenetic
   signal of short high-throughput sequencing reads precludes accurate
   phylogenetic analysis. This is particularly unfortunate in the study of
   microscopic eukaryotes where horizontal gene flow is limited and the
   rRNA gene is expected to accurately reflect the species phylogeny. A
   promising alternative to full phylogenetic analysis is phylogenetic
   placement, where a reference phylogeny is inferred using the complete
   marker gene and iteratively extended with the short sequences from a
   metagenetic sample under study.
   Results: Based on the phylogenetic placement approach we built Seance, a
   community analysis pipeline focused on the analysis of 18S marker gene
   data. Seance combines the alignment extension and phylogenetic placement
   capabilities of the Pagan multiple sequence alignment program with a
   suite of tools to preprocess, cluster and visualise datasets composed of
   many samples. We showcase Seance by analysing 454 data from a
   longitudinal study of intestinal parasite communities in wild rufous
   mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus) as well as in simulation. We demonstrate
   both improved OTU picking at higher levels of sequence similarity for
   454 data and show the accuracy of phylogenetic placement to be
   comparable to maximum likelihood methods for lower numbers of taxa.
   Conclusions: Seance is an open source community analysis pipeline that
   provides reference-based phylogenetic analysis for rRNA marker gene
   studies. Whilst in this article we focus on studying nematodes using the
   18S marker gene, the concepts are generic and reference data for
   alternative marker genes can be easily created. Seance can be downloaded
   from http://wasabiapp.org/software/seance/.},

Title = {Serum and Hepatic Vitamin A Levels in Captive and Wild Marine Toads

Journal = {ZOO BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {The captive breeding program for the endangered Puerto Rican crested
   toad (Peltophryne {[}Bufo] lemur) has been hampered by an undiagnosed
   condition called ``Brown Skin Disease{''} (BSD). Toads develop
   widespread skin darkening, skin thickening and abnormal shedding and
   eventually succumb to a chronic loss of viability. This project
   evaluated the marine toad (Bufo marinus) as a model for the PRCT,
   examining vitamin A deficiency as a potential cause of BSD. Wild caught
   marine toads had significantly higher liver vitamin A concentrations
   (61.89 +/- 63.49 mu g/g) than captive born marine toads (0.58 +/- 0.59
   mu g/g); P < 0.001). A significant difference in serum vitamin A
   concentration was found between the captive and wild caught toads (P =
   0.013) and between the low vitamin A-fed and wild caught toads (P =
   0.004), when controlling for liver vitamin A concentrations. After
   captive toads were treated with topical and/or oral vitamin A, their
   hepatic vitamin A concentrations were similar to those of the wild
   toads, averaging 48.41 +/- 37.03 mu g/g. However, plasma vitamin A
   concentrations pre- and post-vitamin A supplementation did not differ
   statistically. We concluded that plasma vitamin A concentrations do not
   provide a linear indication of liver/body vitamin A status, and that
   both topical and oral supplementation with an oil-based vitamin A
   formulation can increase liver stores in amphibians. No evidence of BSD
   or other signs of deficiency were noted in the marine toads, although
   this feeding trial was relatively short (127 days). To date, clinical,
   pathological and research findings do not support vitamin A deficiency
   as a primary factor underlying BSD. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Journal = {ZOO BIOLOGY},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {The success of ex situ survival assurance populations as tools for
   amphibian conservation depends on the health and reproductive success of
   founder populations. Necropsy examination and histopathology of animals
   that die in assurance populations are useful for the identification of
   population-limiting disease problems and can help to direct applied
   research efforts in areas such as amphibian husbandry and nutrition.
   This study reviewed postmortem findings in 167 frogs from 13 species
   that died in a large Panamanian rescue and survival assurance population
   between 2006 and 2011. Common problems identified in long-term captive
   animals, especially in Atelopus species, were epithelial squamous
   metaplasia suggestive of vitamin A deficiency and a polycystic
   nephropathy resembling lesions seen in laboratory animals with
   electrolyte imbalances. Metabolic bone disease was a significant
   contributor to morbidity in captive-bred juvenile frogs of Gastrotheca
   cornuta, Hemiphractus fasciatus, and Hylomantis lemur. Findings common
   to multiple species included poor overall nutritional condition that was
   sometimes attributable to maladaptation to captive husbandry and
   epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis possibly reflecting
   environmental skin irritation. Infectious diseases and endoparasitism
   were most common in recently captured animals and included
   chytridiomycosis and Rhabdias sp. lungworms. Applied research efforts to
   improve sustainability of survival assurance populations should focus on
   elucidating optimal husbandry practices for diverse species, improving
   methods for nutritional supplementation of cultured insects and
   examination of the role of water composition in disease development. (C)

Abstract = {The two major groups of primates differ in internal nasal anatomy.
   Strepsirrhines (e.g., lemurs) have more numerous turbinals and recesses
   compared with haplorhines (e.g., monkeys). Since detailed quantitative
   comparisons of nasal surface area (SA) have not been made, we measured
   mucosa in serially sectioned monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, Cebuella
   pygmaea). Data were compared with previously published findings on the
   mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus. The nasal airways were digitally
   reconstructed using computed tomography scanned heads of Cebuella and
   Microcebus. In addition, morphometric and functional analyses were
   carried out using segmented photographs of the histological sections of
   Cebuella and Microcebus. The SA of the ethmoturbinal complex is about
   half as large in marmosets compared with Microcebus, and is covered with
   less olfactory mucosa (18\%-24\% in marmosets, compared with approximate
   to 50\% in Microcebus). Whereas the ethmoturbinal complex of Microcebus
   bears half of the total olfactory mucosa in the nasal airway, most
   (approximate to 80\%) olfactory mucosa is distributed on other surfaces
   in the marmosets (e.g., nasal septum). A comparison to previously
   published data suggests all primate species have less olfactory surface
   area (OSA) compared with other similar-sized mammals, but this is
   especially true of marmosets. Taken together, these findings support the
   hypothesis that there is a reduced OSA in at least some haplorhines, and
   this can be linked to diminished posterosuperior dimensions of the nasal
   fossae. However, haplorhines may have minimized their olfactory loss by
   redistributing olfactory mucosa on non-turbinal surfaces. Our findings
   also imply that airflow patterns in the olfactory region differ among
   primates. Anat Rec, 297:2093-2104, 2014. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Title = {High Expression of LMTK3 is an Independent Factor Indicating a Poor

Abstract = {Objective: Over 70\% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor
   alpha-positive, and endocrine therapy targeting estrogen action
   decreases mortality from breast cancer. Recently, a novel protein kinase
   that regulates estrogen receptor alpha activity, lemur tyrosine
   kinase-3, has been identified. In this study, we investigated whether
   messenger RNA expression and polymorphisms of the gene encoding the
   kinase, LMTK3, are associated with prognosis in breast cancer patients
   during long-term follow-up.
   Methods: First, we investigated the relationship between messenger RNA
   expression of LMTK3 and patient outcome in 219 breast cancers. The
   effects of several variables on survival were tested by Cox proportional
   hazards regression analysis. Next, we performed LMTK3 genotyping in 471
   breast cancers to clarify the prognostic role of these polymorphisms.
   Results: Our data showed that LMTK3 expression level was not associated
   with prognosis in all patients. We then analyzed the impact of LMTK3
   mRNA expression on the prognosis of breast cancer according to estrogen
   receptor alpha status. Both disease-free survival and overall survival
   were significantly shorter in estrogen receptor alpha-positive patients
   with high LMTK3 expression receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy than in
   those patients with low LMTK3 expression. Multivariate Cox regression
   analysis revealed that high LMTK3 expression was an independent poor
   prognostic factor in estrogen receptor alpha-positive breast cancer
   patients. We did not find any correlation between LMTK3 genotypes and
   prognosis of breast cancer patients in our series.
   Conclusions: Our results show that high expression of LMTK3 is an
   independent prognostic factor in estrogen receptor alpha-positive breast
   cancer patients receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy.},

Title = {Torpor during Reproduction in Mammals and Birds: Dealing with an
   Energetic Conundrum},
Journal = {INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {54},
Number = {3},
Pages = {516-532},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Torpor and reproduction in mammals and birds are widely viewed as
   mutually exclusive processes because of opposing energetic and hormonal
   demands. However, the reported number of heterothermic species that
   express torpor during reproduction is ever increasing, to some extent
   because of recent work on free-ranging animals. We summarize current
   knowledge about those heterothermic mammals that do not express torpor
   during reproduction and, in contrast, examine those heterothermic birds
   and mammals that do use torpor during reproduction. Incompatibility
   between torpor and reproduction occurs mainly in high-latitude sciurid
   and cricetid rodents, which live in strongly seasonal, but predictably
   productive habitats in summer. In contrast, torpor during incubation,
   brooding, pregnancy, or lactation occurs in nightjars, hummingbirds,
   echidnas, several marsupials, tenrecs, hedgehogs, bats, carnivores,
   mouse lemurs, and dormice. Animals that enter torpor during reproduction
   often are found in unpredictable habitats, in which seasonal
   availability of food can be cut short by changes in weather, or are
   species that reproduce fully or partially during winter. Moreover,
   animals that use torpor during the reproductive period have relatively
   low reproductive costs, are largely insectivorous, carnivorous, or
   nectarivorous, and thus rely on food that can be unpredictable or
   strongly seasonal. These species with relatively unpredictable food
   supplies must gain an advantage by using torpor during reproduction
   because the main cost is an extension of the reproductive period; the
   benefit is increased survival of parent and offspring, and thus fitness.},

Title = {Towards a unified scheme of cortical lamination for primary visual
   cortex across primates: insights from NeuN and VGLUT2 immunoreactivity},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Primary visual cortex (V1) is clearly distinguishable from other
   cortical areas by its distinctive pattern of neocortical lamination
   across mammalian species. In some mammals, primates in particular, the
   layers of V1 are further divided into a number of sublayers based on
   their anatomical and functional characteristics. While these sublayers
   are easily recognizable across a range of primates, the exact number of
   divisions in each layer and their relative position within the depth of
   V1 has been inconsistently reported, largely due to conflicting schemes
   of nomenclature for the V1 layers. This conflict centers on the
   definition of layer 4 in primate V1, and the subdivisions of layer 4
   that can be consistently identified across primate species. Brodmann's
   (1909) laminar scheme for V1 delineates three subdivisions of layer 4 in
   primates, based on cellular morphology and geniculate inputs in
   anthropoid monkeys. In contrast, Hassler's (1967) laminar scheme
   delineates a single layer 4 and multiple subdivisions of layer 3, based
   on comparisons of V1 lamination across the primate lineage. In order to
   clarify laminar divisions in primate visual cortex, we performed NeuN
   and VGLUT2 immunohistochemistry in V1 of chimpanzees, Old World macaque
   monkeys, New World squirrel, owl, and marmoset monkeys, prosimian
   galagos and mouse lemurs, and non-primate, but highly visual, tree
   shrews. By comparing the laminar divisions identified by each method
   across species, we find that Hassler's (1967) laminar scheme for V1
   provides a more consistent representation of neocortical layers across
   all primates, including humans, and facilitates comparisons of V1
   lamination with non-primate species. These findings, along with many
   others, support the consistent use of Hassler's laminar scheme in V1
   research.},

Abstract = {New World monkeys exhibit a more pronounced variability in
   encephalization than other primate taxa. In this comparative study, we
   tested two current hypotheses on brain size evolution, the Expensive
   Brain hypothesis and the Cognitive Buffer hypothesis, in a sample of 21
   platyrrhine species. A high degree of habitat seasonality may impose an
   energetic constraint on brain size evolution if it leads to a high
   variation in caloric intake over time, as predicted by the Expensive
   Brain Hypothesis. However, simultaneously it may also provide the
   opportunity to reap the fitness benefits of increased cognitive
   abilities, which enable the exploitation of high-quality food resources
   even during periods of scarcity, as predicted by the Cognitive Buffer
   hypothesis. By examining the effects of both habitat seasonality and the
   variation in monthly diet composition across species, we found support
   for both hypotheses, confirming previous results for catarrhine primates
   and lemurs. These findings are in accordance with an energetic and
   ecological view of brain size evolution. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {The blindsnake superfamily Typhlopoidea (Gerrhopilidae, Typhlopidae, and
   Xenotyphlopidae) is a diverse, widespread part of the global snake
   fauna. A recent systematic revision based on molecular phylogenetic
   analyses and some morphological evidence presented a preliminary
   solution to the non-monophyly of many previously recognized genera, but
   additional clarification is needed regarding the recognition of some
   species and genera. We rectify these problems here with a new molecular
   phylogenetic analysis including 95 of the 275 currently recognized,
   extant typhlopoids, incorporating both nuclear and mitochondrial loci.
   We supplement this with data on the external, visceral, and hemipenial
   morphology of nearly all species to generate a revised classification
   for Typhlopoidea. Based on morphological data, we re-assign
   Cathetorhinus from Typhlopidae to Gerrhopilidae. Xenotyphlopidae
   maintains its current contents (Xenotyphlops). In Typhlopidae, one
   monotypic genus is synonymized with its larger sister-group as it cannot
   be unambiguously diagnosed morphologically (Sundatyphlops with Anilios),
   and two genera are synonymized with Typhlops (Antillotyphlops and
   Cubatyphlops), as they are not reciprocally monophyletic. The genus
   Asiatyphylops is renamed Argyrophis, the senior synonym for the group.
   We erect one new genus (Lemuriatyphlops) for a phylogenetically distinct
   species-group in Asiatyphlopinae. Fourteen of eighteen recognized
   typhlopid genera are maintained in four subfamilies: Afrotyphlopinae

Abstract = {Pinworms (Nematoda: Enterobiinae) include 52 species parasitising
   primates throughout the world. In the present study, we performed the
   first ever molecular analysis to investigate the phylogenetic position
   of recently described pinworms parasitising the Sumatran orang-utan. The
   phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial CO1 and chromosomal 18S rDNA and
   ITS1 regions could support the independent status of several Nematoda
   species. Our molecular data clearly suggest that Enterobius
   (Colobenterobius) buckleyi and Lemuricola (Protenterobius) pongoi
   together with Pongobius hugoti form separate clades among other studied
   species, which significantly supports the hypothesis of recently
   described new species parasitising the orang-utan (Pongo abelii and
   Pongo pygmaeus). The phylogenetic tree based on cytochrome oxidase 1
   (CO1) gene variability showed possible close relationships between L.
   (Protenterobius) pongoi and P. hugoti; thus, we can assume that these
   species could have initially diverged in sympatry from a common
   ancestor.},

Title = {The Kinase LMTK3 Promotes Invasion in Breast Cancer Through
   GRB2-Mediated Induction of Integrin beta(1)},
Journal = {SCIENCE SIGNALING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {330},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) is associated with cell proliferation
   and endocrine resistance in breast cancer. We found that, in cultured
   breast cancer cell lines, LMTK3 promotes the development of a metastatic
   phenotype by inducing the expression of genes encoding integrin
   subunits. Invasive behavior in various breast cancer cell lines
   positively correlated with the abundance of LMTK3. Overexpression of
   LMTK3 in a breast cancer cell line with low endogenous LMTK3 abundance
   promoted actin cytoskeleton remodeling, focal adhesion formation, and
   adhesion to collagen and fibronectin in culture. Using SILAC (stable
   isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) proteomic analysis, we
   found that LMTK3 increased the abundance of integrin subunits alpha(5)
   and beta(1), encoded by ITGA5 and ITGB1. This effect depended on the
   CDC42 Rho family guanosine triphosphatase, which was in turn activated
   by the interaction between LMTK3 and growth factor receptor-bound
   protein 2 (GRB2), an adaptor protein that mediates receptor tyrosine
   kinase-induced activation of RAS and downstream signaling. Knockdown of
   GRB2 suppressed LMTK3-induced CDC42 activation, blocked ITGA5 and ITGB1
   expression promoted by the transcription factor serum response factor
   (SRF), and reduced invasive activity. Furthermore, abundance of LMTK3
   positively correlated with that of the integrin beta(1) subunit in
   breast cancer patient's tumors. Our findings suggest a role for LMTK3 in
   promoting integrin activity during breast cancer progression and
   metastasis.},

Title = {The First Endogenous Herpesvirus, Identified in the Tarsier Genome, and
   Novel Sequences from Primate Rhadinoviruses and Lymphocryptoviruses},
Journal = {PLOS GENETICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {Herpesviridae is a diverse family of large and complex pathogens whose
   genomes are extremely difficult to sequence. This is particularly true
   for clinical samples, and if the virus, host, or both genomes are being
   sequenced for the first time. Although herpesviruses are known to
   occasionally integrate in host genomes, and can also be inherited in a
   Mendelian fashion, they are notably absent from the genomic fossil
   record comprised of endogenous viral elements (EVEs). Here, we combine
   paleovirological and metagenomic approaches to both explore the
   constituent viral diversity of mammalian genomes and search for
   endogenous herpesviruses. We describe the first endogenous herpesvirus
   from the genome of the Philippine tarsier, belonging to the Roseolovirus
   genus, and characterize its highly defective genome that is integrated
   and flanked by unambiguous host DNA. From a draft assembly of the
   aye-aye genome, we use bioinformatic tools to reveal over 100,000 bp of
   a novel rhadinovirus that is the first lemur gammaherpesvirus, closely
   related to Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus. We also identify 58 genes
   of Pan paniscus lymphocryptovirus 1, the bonobo equivalent of human
   Epstein-Barr virus. For each of the viruses, we postulate gene function
   via comparative analysis to known viral relatives. Most notably, the
   evidence from gene content and phylogenetics suggests that the aye-aye
   sequences represent the most basal known rhadinovirus, and indicates
   that tumorigenic herpesviruses have been infecting primates since their
   emergence in the late Cretaceous. Overall, these data show that a
   genomic fossil record of herpesviruses exists despite their extremely
   large genomes, and expands the known diversity of Herpesviridae, which
   will aid the characterization of pathogenesis. Our analytical approach
   illustrates the benefit of intersecting evolutionary approaches with
   metagenomics, genetics and paleovirology.},

Title = {DOSE TITRATION OF DEFERASIROX IRON CHELATION THERAPY BY MAGNETIC
   RESONANCE IMAGING FOR CHRONIC IRON STORAGE DISEASE IN THREE ADULT RED

Abstract = {Iron overload is common in lemurs and some New World nonhuman primates
   raised in captivity, but there is no such documentation in the red
   bald-headed uakari (Cacajao calvus rubicundus). This study describes
   postmortem documentation of severe iron storage disease in one red
   bald-headed uakari and the use of iron chelation with oral deferasirox
   in the three surviving members of the colony. Magnetic resonance imaging
   was used to quantify pretreatment iron burden and to follow the response
   to therapy in two females, 22 and 28 yr of age, and one male 33 yr of
   age. Baseline liver iron concentrations ranged from 16 to 23 mg/g dry
   weight. In humans, a liver iron concentration greater than 15 mg/g is
   considered severe and associated with endocrine and cardiac toxicity.
   The uakaris were otherwise asymptomatic, generally healthy, nonpregnant,
   and on a stable, low-iron diet. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging
   indicated that dosage escalations up to 100 mg/kg were needed to produce
   meaningful reductions in iron stores. After 5 yr of therapy, two animals
   continue at a dosage of 100 mg/kg per day, and the third was
   transitioned to twice-weekly maintenance dosing because of successful
   deironing. The animals tolerated iron chelation therapy well, having
   stable hematologic, renal, and hepatic function profiles before, during,
   and after treatment. Deferasirox monotherapy may represent a therapeutic
   option in primates with iron storage disease when dietary measures are
   ineffective and phlebotomy is logistically challenging.},

Abstract = {Neurons extend two types of neurites-axons and dendrites-that differ in
   structure and function. Although it is well understood that the
   cytoskeleton plays a pivotal role in neurite differentiation and
   extension, the mechanisms by which membrane components are supplied to
   growing axons or dendrites is largely unknown. We previously reported
   that the membrane supply to axons is regulated by lemur kinase 1 (LMTK1)
   through Rab11A-positive endosomes. Here we investigate the role of LMTK1
   in dendrite formation. Downregulation of LMTK1 increases dendrite growth
   and branching of cerebral cortical neurons in vitro and in vivo. LMTK1
   knockout significantly enhances the prevalence, velocity, and run length
   of anterograde movement of Rab11A-positive endosomes to levels similar
   to those expressing constitutively active Rab11A-Q70L. Rab11A-positive
   endosome dynamics also increases in the cell body and growth cone of
   LMTK1-deficient neurons. Moreover, a nonphosphorylatable LMTK1 mutant
   (Ser34Ala, a Cdk5 phosphorylation site) dramatically promotes dendrite
   growth. Thus LMTK1 negatively controls dendritic formation by regulating
   Rab11A-positive endosomal trafficking in a Cdk5-dependent manner,
   indicating the Cdk5-LMTK1-Rab11A pathway as a regulatory mechanism of
   dendrite development as well as axon outgrowth.},

Abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a Cl-
   -selective ion channel expressed in fluid-transporting epithelia. Lemur
   tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) is a transmembrane protein with serine and
   threonine but not tyrosine kinase activity. Previous work identified
   CFTR as an in vitro substrate of LMTK2, suggesting a functional link.
   Here we demonstrate that LMTK2 co-immunoprecipitates with CFTR and
   phosphorylates CFTR-Ser737 inhumanairway epithelial cells.
   LMTK2knockdown or expression of inactive LMTK2 kinase domain increases
   cell surface density of CFTR by attenuating its endocytosis in human
   airway epithelial cells. Moreover, LMTK2 knockdown increases Cl-
   secretion mediated by the wild-type and rescued Delta F508-CFTR.
   Compared with the wild-type CFTR, the phosphorylation-deficient mutant
   CFTR-S737A shows increased cell surface density and decreased
   endocytosis. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism of the
   phospho-dependent inhibitory effect of CFTR-Ser(737) mediated by LMTK2
   via endocytosis and inhibition of the cell surface density of CFTRCl-
   channels. These data indicate that targeting LMTK2 may increase the cell
   surface density of CFTR Cl- channels and improve stability of
   pharmacologically rescued Delta F508-CFTR in patients with cystic
   fibrosis.},

Abstract = {The lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3) has been reported to be involved in
   tumor progression. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic
   and prognostic significances of preoperative serum LMTK3 in non-small
   cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Sera were collected from 100 healthy
   volunteers (HV), 280 benign lung diseases (BLD) patients, and 524 NSCLC
   patients prior to operation. The serum LMTK3 level was detected by
   ELISA. We found that serum LMTK3 level was markedly elevated in NSCLC
   patients compared with controls. The receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC) curve suggests that serum LMTK3 is a good diagnostic and
   differential marker for discriminating NSCLC patients from BLD. NSCLC
   patients with LMTK3 level a parts per thousand yen6.85 ng/ml had
   significantly worse survival than patients with LMTK3 < 6.85 ng/ml. In
   multivariate analysis, LMTK3 level a parts per thousand yen6.85 ng/ml
   was an independent factor of poor prognosis {[}hazard ratio (HR) = 2.95;
   p = 0.011] after adjusting for age, sex, smoking behavior, stage, and
   histology. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed the consistent trend.
   Preoperative serum LMTK3 is a novel diagnostic and independent
   prognostic biomarker in patients with NSCLC.},

Number = {1},
Pages = {1-11},

Abstract = {Diurnality, associated with enhanced visual acuity and color vision, is
   typical of most modern Primates. However, it remains a matter of debate
   when and how many times primates re-acquired diurnality or returned to
   nocturnality. We analyzed the features specific to nocturnal and diurnal
   vision that were recently found in the nuclei of mammalian rod
   photoreceptor cells in 11 species representing various groups of the
   Primates and related tree shrew and colugo. In particular,
   heterochromatin in rod nuclei of nocturnal mammals is clustered in the
   center of rod nuclei (inverted architecture), whereas rods of diurnal
   mammals retain rods with peripheral heterochromatin (conventional
   architecture). Rod nuclei of the nocturnal owl monkey have a state
   transitional to the inverted one. Surprisingly, rod nuclei of the
   tarsier have a conventional nuclear architecture typical for diurnal
   mammals, strongly implying that recent Tarsiiformes returned to
   nocturnality from the diurnal state. Diurnal lemurs retain inverted rod
   nuclei typical of nocturnal mammals, which conforms to the notion that
   the ancestors of all Lemuroidea were nocturnal. Data on the expression
   of proteins indispensable for peripheral heterochromatin maintenance
   (and, respectively, conventional or inverted nuclear organization) in
   rod cells support the view that the primate ancestors were nocturnal and
   transition to diurnality occurred independently in several primate and
   related groups: Tupaia, diurnal lemurs, and, at least partially
   independently, in Simiiformes (monkeys and apes) and Tarsiiformes.},

Title = {The influence of body posture on the kinematics of prehension in humans
   and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla)},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {232},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1047-1056},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Much of our current understanding of human prehension in a comparative
   context is based on macaque models in a sitting, constrained body
   posture. In a previous study, we clearly showed differences in the
   amplitude of the forelimb joints between five primate species (lemur,
   capuchin, chimpanzee, gorilla and human) during unconstrained grasping
   where the animals were free to choose their body posture. One of our
   interrogations was to know if these differences could be due to the body
   posture. To address this question, this study compares humans with new
   data for gorillas during an unconstrained food prehension task in two
   body postures, a sitting and a quadrupedal one. The objective is to
   determine the behavioral and kinematic strategies (amplitudes and
   patterns of evolution of the articular angles) as well as differences
   and invariants of trunk and forelimb motions between species. The
   subjects were recorded by five cameras, and landmarks were digitized
   frame by frame to reconstruct 3D movement. Our results show that (1)
   despite significant influences of body postures on ranges of motion in
   gorillas and humans, species preserve their specific forelimb joint and
   trunk contribution; (2) body posture has a limited effect on the basic
   pattern of wrist velocity. Our study indicates that different primate
   species have specific kinematic features of limb coordination during
   prehension, which dose not alter with changes in posture. Therefore,
   across varying species, it is possible to compare limb kinematics
   irrespective of postural constraints and unconstrained condition need to
   be explored in other primates to understand the evolution of primate
   prehension.},

Title = {Interspecific scaling patterns of talar articular surfaces within
   primates and their closest living relatives},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANATOMY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {224},
Number = {2},
Pages = {150-172},

Abstract = {The articular facets of interosseous joints must transmit forces while
   maintaining relatively low stresses. To prevent overloading, joints that
   transmit higher forces should therefore have larger facet areas. The
   relative contributions of body mass and muscle-induced forces to joint
   stress are unclear, but generate opposing hypotheses. If mass-induced
   forces dominate, facet area should scale with positive allometry to body
   mass. Alternatively, muscle-induced forces should cause facets to scale
   isometrically with body mass. Within primates, both scaling patterns
   have been reported for articular surfaces of the femoral and humeral
   heads, but more distal elements are less well studied. Additionally,
   examination of complex articular surfaces has largely been limited to
   linear measurements, so that true area' remains poorly assessed. To
   re-assess these scaling relationships, we examine the relationship
   between body size and articular surface areas of the talus. Area
   measurements were taken from microCT scan-generated surfaces of all
   talar facets from a comprehensive sample of extant euarchontan taxa
   (primates, treeshrews, and colugos). Log-transformed data were regressed
   on literature-derived log-body mass using reduced major axis and
   phylogenetic least squares regressions. We examine the scaling patterns
   of muscle mass and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) to body
   mass, as these relationships may complicate each model. Finally, we
   examine the scaling pattern of hindlimb muscle PCSA to talar articular
   surface area, a direct test of the effect of mass-induced forces on
   joint surfaces. Among most groups, there is an overall trend toward
   positive allometry for articular surfaces. The ectal (=posterior
   calcaneal) facet scales with positive allometry among all groups except
   sundatherians', strepsirrhines, galagids, and lorisids. The medial
   tibial facet scales isometrically among all groups except lemuroids.
   Scaling coefficients are not correlated with sample size, clade
   inclusivity or behavioral diversity of the sample. Muscle mass scales
   with slight positive allometry to body mass, and PCSA scales at isometry
   to body mass. PCSA generally scales with negative allometry to articular
   surface area, which indicates joint surfaces increase faster than
   muscles' ability to generate force. We suggest a synthetic model to
   explain the complex patterns observed for talar articular surface area
   scaling: whether muscles or mass' drive articular facet scaling is
   probably dependent on the body size range of the sample and the
   biological role of the facet. The relationship between muscle vs. mass'
   dominance is likely bone- and facet-specific, meaning that some facets
   should respond primarily to stresses induced by larger body mass,
   whereas others primarily reflect muscle forces.},

Title = {Taxonomy of nesomyine rodents (Muroidea: Nesomyidae: Nesomyinae):
   Designation of lectotypes and restriction of type localities for
   species-group taxa in the genus Nesomys Peters},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE BIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {126},

Month = {JAN 30},
Abstract = {Key foundational elements of taxonomic description were omitted in the
   original naming of species-group taxa now recognized in the Malagasy
   genus Nesomys: N. rufus Peters, 1870, N. audeberti (Jentink, 1879), and
   N. lambertoni G. Grandidier, 1928. Based on our review of the material
   available to the authors, we identified the holotype by monotypy of N.
   rufus, designated lectotypes of N. audeberti and N. lambertoni,
   restricted the type localities of N. audeberti and NI lambertoni, and
   localized the probable geographic source of the holotype of N. rufus.
   Refinement of the geographic source of N. lambertoni and N. rufus
   illuminates the incorrect placement of their type localities as
   currently interpreted and brings them within the presently understood
   distributions of those species. Extensive discussion is devoted to the
   travels of J. Audebert and A. Crossley, collectors not only of the types
   of N. audeberti and N. rufus, respectively, but also of important series
   of lemurs that remain relevant to understanding the taxonomy and
   distribution of these endangered mammals.},

Title = {Antibody Responses to a Novel Plasmodium falciparum Merozoite Surface
   Protein Vaccine Correlate with Protection against Experimental Malaria

Abstract = {The Block 2 region of the merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) of
   Plasmodium falciparum has been identified as a target of protective
   immunity by a combination of seroepidemiology and parasite population
   genetics. Immunogenicity studies in small animals and Aotus monkeys were
   used to determine the efficacy of recombinant antigens derived from this
   region of MSP-1 as a potential vaccine antigen. Aotus lemurinus
   griseimembra monkeys were immunized three times with a recombinant
   antigen derived from the Block 2 region of MSP-1 of the monkey-adapted
   challenge strain, FVO of Plasmodium falciparum, using an adjuvant
   suitable for use in humans. Immunofluorescent antibody assays (IFA)
   against erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum using sera from the
   immunized monkeys showed that the MSP-1 Block 2 antigen induced
   significant antibody responses to whole malaria parasites. MSP-1 Block 2
   antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) showed no
   significant differences in antibody titers between immunized animals.
   Immunized animals were challenged with the virulent P. falciparum FVO
   isolate and monitored for 21 days. Two out of four immunized animals
   were able to control their parasitaemia during the follow-up period,
   whereas two out of two controls developed fulminating parasitemia.
   Parasite-specific serum antibody titers measured by IFA were four-fold
   higher in protected animals than in unprotected animals. In addition,
   peptide-based epitope mapping of serum antibodies from immunized Aotus
   showed distinct differences in epitope specificities between protected
   and unprotected animals.},

Abstract = {Estrogen positive breast cancer is a dreadful disease in women
   worldwide. The human estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha) pathway plays a
   critical role in estrogenic signaling and targeting ER alpha in breast
   cancer treatment. The key role of Lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3) in
   regulation of ER alpha has been identified and it is found to be a novel
   therapeutic target for breast cancer. With lack of structural studies on
   LMTK3, the breast cancer therapeutics research remains elusive. In this
   computational study, we performed structural studies on LMTK3 by
   structural modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the apo
   state and the ATP bound state. The structure of the LMTK3 domain was
   developed by using I-TASSER server and validated by quality index and
   Ramachandran plot. MD simulation analysis explained the structural
   behavior of the LMTK3 domain in the dynamic system and the apo state
   showed defined protein folding with stable conformation. The mechanism
   of ATP binding was studied using molecular docking, resulting in the
   identification of critical residues and the ATP binding cavity.
   Furthermore, MD simulation of the LMTK3-ATP complex was performed and
   the trajectory analyses confirmed the stability and effective binding of
   ATP in the dynamic system. Overall, our computational reports provide
   more information on the structure-function relationship of LMTK3 with
   ATP. The critical residues Tyr185 and Asp284 found in the ATP binding
   cavity may be useful in designing potential inhibitors on human LMTK3.},

Title = {Morphometric and Statistical Analysis of the Palmaris Longus Muscle in

Journal = {BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {The palmaris longus is considered a phylogenetic degenerate
   metacarpophalangeal joint flexor muscle in humans, a small vestigial
   forearm muscle; it is the most variable muscle in humans, showing
   variation in position, duplication, slips and could be reverted. It is
   frequently studied in papers about human anatomical variations in
   cadavers and in vivo, its variation has importance in medical clinic,
   surgery, radiological analysis, in studies about high-performance
   athletes, in genetics and anthropologic studies. Most studies about
   palmaris longus in humans are associated to frequency or case studies,
   but comparative anatomy in primates and comparative morphometry were not
   found in scientific literature. Comparative anatomy associated to
   morphometry of palmaris longus could explain the degeneration observed
   in this muscle in two of three of the great apes. Hypothetically, the
   comparison of the relative length of tendons and belly could indicate
   the pathway of the degeneration of this muscle, that is, the
   degeneration could be associated to increased tendon length and
   decreased belly from more primitive primates to those most derivate,
   that is, great apes to modern humans. In conclusion, in primates, the
   tendon of the palmaris longus increase from Lemuriformes to modern
   humans, that is, from arboreal to terrestrial primates and the muscle
   became weaker and tending to be missing.},

Abstract = {Active pursuit of extra-pair mating has been reported for Indri indri,
   the socially monogamous largest living lemur. This study, conducted in a
   mountain rainforest in eastern Madagascar, presents the first evidence
   for extra-pair mating of indri and discusses the alternative mating
   strategy and alteration of the social, territorial, spatial, and vocal
   behavior of the adult female of a group of wild indris. Further studies
   may investigate whether extra-pair copulation is an attempt to breed
   with a partner of superior quality and thus lead to extra-pair
   paternity. If so, it could potentially play a role in maintaining
   genetic variability within a population.},

Title = {The Role of Piloerection in Primate Thermoregulation},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {85},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-17},
Abstract = {The insulating properties of the primate integument are influenced by
   many factors, including piloerection, which raises the hair and
   insulates the body by creating motionless air near the skin's surface.
   The involuntary muscles that control piloerection, the musculi
   arrectores pilorum (MAP), are mostly absent except on the tail in most
   strep-sirhines, and are entirely absent in tarsiers and some lorisids.
   The absence of piloerection and the reduced effectiveness of pilary
   insulation in preventing heat loss affected the evolution of behavior
   and metabolic thermoregulation in these animals. In lemurs, this
   situation contributed to the use of positional and social behaviors such
   as sunning and huddling that help maintain thermal homeostasis during
   day-night and seasonal temperature cycles. It also contributed in many
   lemurs and lorises to the evolution of a wide variety of activity
   patterns and energy-conserving metabolic patterns such as cathemerality,
   daily torpor, and hibernation. The absence of functional MAP in
   strepsirhines and tarsiers implies the absence of effective piloerection
   in early primates, and the reacquisition of whole-body MAP in ancestral
   anthropoids prior to the separation of platyrrhine and catarrhine
   lineages. (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {With the evolution of a relatively large brain size in haplorhine
   primates (i.e. tarsiers, monkeys, apes, and humans), there have been
   associated changes in the molecular machinery that delivers energy to
   the neocortex. Here we investigated variation in lactate dehydrogenase
   (LDH) expression and isoenzyme composition of the neocortex and striatum
   in primates using quantitative Western blotting and isoenzyme analysis
   of total homogenates and synaptosomal fractions. Analysis of isoform
   expression revealed that LDH in synaptosomal fractions from both
   forebrain regions shifted towards a predominance of the heart-type,
   aerobic isoform LDH-B among haplorhines as compared to strepsirrhines
   (i.e. lorises and lemurs), while in the total homogenate of the
   neocortex and striatum there was no significant difference in LDH
   isoenzyme composition between the primate suborders. The largest
   increase occurred in synapse-associated LDH-B expression in the
   neocortex, with an especially remarkable elevation in the ratio of
   LDH-B/LDH-A in humans. The phylogenetic variation in the ratio of
   LDH-B/LDH-A was correlated with species-typical brain mass but not the
   encephalization quotient. A significant LDH-B increase in the
   subneuronal fraction from haplorhine neocortex and striatum suggests a
   relatively higher rate of aerobic glycolysis that is linked to
   synaptosomal mitochondrial metabolism. Our results indicate that there
   is a differential composition of LDH isoenzynnes and metabolism in
   synaptic terminals that evolved in primates to meet increased energy
   requirements in association with brain enlargement. (C) 2014 S. Karger

Title = {Morphological Study of the Supracondylar Process of the Humerus and Its
   Clinical Implications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-3},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: The supracondylar process of the humerus, which is also
   called the supra-epitrochlear, epicondylar, epicondylic process or a
   supratrochlear spur, is a hook-like, bony spine of variable size that
   may project distally from the anteromedial surface of the humerus. It
   represents the embryologic vestigial remnant of climbing animals and
   seen in many reptiles, most marsupials, cats, lemurs and American
   monkeys.
   Materials and Methods: Two hundred and forty dried humeri were studied
   from department of Anatomy, Sri Siddhartha Medical College, Tumkur,
   Karnataka, India. The bones were examined for supracondylar process. On
   finding, the dimensions were recorded and photographed.
   Results: Out of 240 dried humeri examined we found only 1 humerus of the
   left side with an osseous spine on the anteromedial surface. The
   incidence calculated in this study was 0.41 \%.
   Conclusion: The supracondylar process is frequently misjudged as a
   pathological condition of the bone rather than as a normal anatomical
   variation. Though, this process has been of more interest to anatomists
   and anthropologists because of a possible link to the origins and
   relations of the human races than to clinicians, many of whom are not
   aware of its occasional presence. It is usually clinically silent, but
   may become symptomatic by presenting as a mass or can be associated with
   symptoms of median nerve compression and claudication of the brachial
   artery.},

Abstract = {Introduction: In the ageing process there are some species of non-human
   primates which can show some of the defining characteristics of the
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) of man, both in neuropathological changes and
   cognitive-behavioural symptoms. The study of these species is of prime
   importance to understand AD and develop therapies to combat this
   neurodegenerative disease.
   Development: In this second part of the study, these AD features are
   discussed in the most important non-experimental AD models (Mouse Lemur
   -Microcebus murinus, Caribbean vervet -Chlorocebus aethiops, and the
   Rhesus and stump-tailed macaque -Macaca mulatta and M. arctoides) and
   experimental models (lesional, neurotoxic, pharmacological,
   immunological, etc.) non-human primates. In all these models cerebral
   amyloid neuropathology can occur in senility, although with different
   levels of incidence (100\% in vervets; <30\% in macaques). The
   differences between normal and pathological (Alzheimer's) senility in
   these species are difficult to establish due to the lack of
   cognitive-behavioural studies in the many groups analysed, as well as
   the controversy in the results of these studies when they were carried
   out. However, in some macaques, a correlation between a high degree of
   functional brain impairment and a large number of neuropathological
   changes ({''}possible AD{''}) has been found.
   Conclusions: In some non-human primates, such as the macaque, the
   existence of a possible continuum between ``normal{''} ageing process,
   ``normal{''} ageing with no deep neuropathological and
   cognitive-behavioural changes, and ``pathological ageing{''} (or
   ``Alzheimer type ageing{''}), may be considered. In other cases, such as
   the Caribbean vervet, neuropathological changes are constant and quite
   marked, but its impact on cognition and behaviour does not seem to be
   very important. This does assume the possible existence in the human
   senile physiological regression of a stable phase without dementia even
   if neuropathological changes appeared. (C) 2011 Sociedad Espanola de

Title = {Climatic Niche Evolution in New World Monkeys (Platyrrhini)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {Despite considerable interest in recent years on species distribution
   modeling and phylogenetic niche conservatism, little is known about the
   way in which climatic niches change over evolutionary time. This
   knowledge is of major importance to understand the mechanisms underlying
   limits of species distributions, as well as to infer how different
   lineages might be affected by anthropogenic climate change. In this
   study we investigate the tempo and mode climatic niche evolution in New
   World monkeys (Platyrrhini). Climatic conditions found throughout the
   distribution of 140 primate species were investigated using a principal
   component analysis, which indicated that mean temperature (particularly
   during the winter) is the most important climatic correlate of
   platyrrhine geographical distributions, accounting for nearly half of
   the interspecific variation in climatic niches. The effects of
   precipitation were associated with the second principal component,
   particularly with respect to the dry season. When models of trait
   evolution were fit to scores on each of the principal component axes,
   significant phylogenetic signal was detected for PC1 scores, but not for
   PC2 scores. Interestingly, although all platyrrhine families occupied
   comparable regions of climatic space, some aotid species such as Aotus
   lemurinus, A. jorgehernandezi, and A. miconax show highly distinctive
   climatic niches associated with drier conditions (high PC2 scores). This
   shift might have been made possible by their nocturnal habits, which
   could serve as an exaptation that allow them to be less constrained by
   humidity during the night. These results underscore the usefulness of
   investigating explicitly the tempo and mode of climatic niche evolution
   and its role in determining species distributions.},

Title = {Djebelemur, a Tiny Pre-Tooth-Combed Primate from the Eocene of Tunisia:
   A Glimpse into the Origin of Crown Strepsirhines},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 4},
Abstract = {Background: Molecular clock estimates of crown strepsirhine origins
   generally advocate an ancient antiquity for Malagasy lemuriforms and
   Afro-Asian lorisiforms, near the onset of the Tertiary but most often
   extending back to the Late Cretaceous. Despite their inferred early
   origin, the subsequent evolutionary histories of both groups (except for
   the Malagasy aye-aye lineage) exhibit a vacuum of lineage
   diversification during most part of the Eocene, followed by a relative
   acceleration in diversification from the late Middle Eocene. This early
   evolutionary stasis was tentatively explained by the possibility of
   unrecorded lineage extinctions during the early Tertiary. However, this
   prevailing molecular view regarding the ancient origin and early
   diversification of crown strepsirhines must be viewed with skepticism
   due to the new but still scarce paleontological evidence gathered in
   recent years.
   Methodological/Principal Findings: Here, we describe new fossils
   attributable to Djebelemur martinezi, a approximate to 50 Ma primate
   from Tunisia (Djebel Chambi). This taxon was originally interpreted as a
   cercamoniine adapiform based on limited information from its lower
   dentition. The new fossils provide anatomical evidence demonstrating
   that Djebelemur was not an adapiform but clearly a distant relative of
   lemurs, lorises and galagos. Cranial, dental and postcranial remains
   indicate that this diminutive primate was likely nocturnal, predatory
   (primarily insectivorous), and engaged in a form of generalized arboreal
   quadrupedalism with frequent horizontal leaping. Djebelemur did not have
   an anterior lower dentition as specialized as that characterizing most
   crown strepsirhines (i.e., tooth-comb), but it clearly exhibited a
   transformed antemolar pattern representing an early stage of a crown
   strepsirhine-like adaptation ({''}pre-tooth-comb{''}).
   Conclusions/Significance: These new fossil data suggest that the
   differentiation of the tooth-comb must postdate the djebelemurid
   divergence, a view which hence constrains the timing of crown
   strepsirhine origins to the Middle Eocene, and then precludes the
   existence of unrecorded lineage extinctions of tooth-combed primates
   during the earliest Tertiary.},

Abstract = {The recently described Linderniaceae are a monophyletic group that
   emerged in the course of the disintegration of the Scrophulariaceae in
   the last years. First molecular studies sampled only a small fraction of
   the genera assigned to the Linderniaceae, but later Lindernia was shown
   to be non-monophyletic. Here we used a plastid trnK/matK sequence
   dataset to get further insights into the relationships within
   Linderniaceae. The genus Lindernia as accepted to date is shown to be
   polyphyletic. Stemodiopsis is found to be sister to the remaining
   Linderniaceae, and the genera Psammetes and Bryodes are found to be
   nested in a Lindernia s.str.clade. We present a taxonomic framework,
   taking account of the phylogenetic relationships in the family, and a
   first key to the genera. The genera Bonnaya and Vandellia are
   resurrected and a new genus Linderniella is described. The following
   eight replacement names are proposed: Craterostigma engleri, C.
   tanzanicum, Lindernia benthamii, L. lemuriana, Linderniella pusilla,
   Torenia bonatii, T. davidii and T. philcoxii. Seventy-seven new
   combinations are made in Bonnaya, Craterostigma, Lindernia,
   Linderniella, Micranthemum, Torenia and Vandellia.},

Abstract = {Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality in females,
   and about 70\% of the primary breast cancer patients are diagnosed
   ER-positive, which is the most common type of breast cancer.
   MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a) has been shown to be a master regulator of tumor
   suppression in many types of cancers including breast cancer. However,
   the role of miR-34a in ER-positive breast cancer has not been
   elucidated. Here, we find that in MCF-7, which is an ER-positive breast
   cancer cell line, miR-34a is remarkably downregulated after E2
   treatment. Overexpression of miR-34a by lentivirus suppresses cell
   proliferation, S phase ratio, and tumor formation in an E2-dependent
   manner in vitro. According to the mRNA sequence, lemur tyrosine kinase 3
   (LMTK3), which is an important regulator of estrogen receptor alpha
   (ER), is a predicted target of miR-34a. This is confirmed by dual
   luciferase reporter assay and the decrease of LMTK3 mRNA and protein
   levels after overexpression of miR-34a. Moreover, miR-34a overexpression
   decreases AKT signaling pathway and increases ER phosphorylation status.
   Taken together, these results suggest that miR-34a inhibits breast
   cancer proliferation by targeting LMTK3 and might be used as an anti-ER
   agent in breast cancer therapy.},

Abstract = {Among anthropogenic pressures, light pollution altering light/dark
   cycles and changing the nocturnal component of the environment
   constitutes a threat for biodiversity. Light pollution is widely spread
   across the world and continuously growing. However, despite the efforts
   realized to describe and understand the effects of artificial lighting
   on fauna, few studies have documented its consequences on biological
   rhythms, behavioral and physiological functions in nocturnal mammals. To
   determine the impacts of light pollution on nocturnal mammals an
   experimental study was conducted on a nocturnal primate, the grey mouse
   lemur Microcebus murinus. Male mouse lemurs (N = 8) were exposed 14
   nights to moonlight treatment and then exposed 14 nights to light
   pollution treatment. For both treatments, chronobiological parameters
   related to locomotor activity and core temperature were recorded using
   telemetric transmitters. In addition, at the end of each treatment, the
   14th night, nocturnal and feeding behaviors were explored using an
   infrared camera. Finally, throughout the study, body mass and daily
   caloric food intake were recorded. For the first time in a nocturnal
   primate, light pollution was demonstrated to modify daily rhythms of
   locomotor activity and core temperature especially through phase delays
   and increases in core temperature. Moreover, nocturnal activity and
   feeding behaviors patterns were modified negatively. This study suggests
   that light pollution induces daily desynchronization of biological
   rhythms and could lead to seasonal desynchronization with potential
   deleterious consequences for animals in terms of adaptation and
   anticipation of environmental changes.},

Title = {New insights into the ear region anatomy and cranial blood supply of

   the Eocene of Chambi, Tunisia},

Abstract = {We report the discovery of three isolated primate petrosal fragments
   from the fossiliferous locality of Chambi (Tunisia), a primate-bearing
   locality dating from the late early to the early middle Eocene. These
   fossils display a suite of anatomical characteristics otherwise found
   only in strepsirhines, and as such might be attributed either to
   Djebelemur or/and cf. Algeripithecus, the two diminutive stem
   strepsirhine primates recorded from this locality. Although damaged, the
   petrosals provide substantial information regarding the ear anatomy of
   these advanced stem strepsirhines (or pre-tooth-combed primates),
   notably the patterns of the pathway of the arterial blood supply. Using
   mu CT-scanning techniques and digital segmentation of the structures, we
   show that the transpromontorial and stapedial branches of the internal
   carotid artery (ICA) were present (presence of bony tubes), but
   seemingly too small to supply enough blood to the cranium alone. This
   suggests that the ICA was not the main cranial blood supply in stem
   strepsirhines, but that the pharyngeal or vertebral artery primitively
   ensured a great part of this role instead, an arterial pattern that is
   reminiscent of modern cheirogaleid, lepilemurid lemuriforms and
   lorisiforms. This could explain parallel loss of the ICA functionality
   among these families. Specific measurements made on the cochlea indicate
   that the small strepsirhine primate(s) from Chambi was (were) highly
   sensitive to high frequencies and poorly sensitive to low frequencies.
   Finally, variance from orthogonality of the plane of the semicircular
   canals (SCs) calculated on one petrosal (CBI-1-569) suggests that
   Djebelemur or cf. Algeripithecus likely moved (at least its head) in a
   way similar to that of modern mouse lemurs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Most scholars agree that avoiding predators is a central concern of
   lemurs, monkeys, and apes. However, given uncertainties about the
   frequency with which primates actually become prey, the selective
   importance of predation in primate evolution continues to be debated.
   Some argue that primates are often killed by predators, while others
   maintain that such events are relatively rare. Some authors have
   contended that predation's influence on primate sociality has been
   trivial; others counter that predation need not occur often to be a
   powerful selective force. Given the challenges of documenting events
   that can be ephemeral and irregular, we are unlikely ever to amass the
   volume of systematic, comparative data we have on such topics as
   feeding, social dynamics, or locomotor behavior. Nevertheless, a steady
   accumulation of field observations, insight gained from natural
   experiments, and novel taphonomic analyses have enhanced understanding
   of how primates interact with several predators, especially raptors, the
   subject of this review.},

Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Following a series of experiments in which six orangutans and one
   gorilla discriminated photographs of different animal species in a
   two-choice touch screen procedure, Vonk \& MacDonald (2002) and Vonk \&
   MacDonald (2004) concluded that orangutans, but not the gorilla, seemed
   to learn intermediate level category discriminations, such as primates
   versus non-primates, more rapidly than they learned concrete level
   discriminations, such as orangutans versus humans. In the current
   experiments, four of the same orangutans and the gorilla were presented
   with delayed matching-to-sample tasks in which they were rewarded for
   matching photos of different members of the same primate species; golden
   lion tamarins, Japanese macaques, and proboscis monkeys, or family;
   gibbons, lemurs (Experiment 1), and subsequently for matching photos of
   different species within the following classes: birds, reptiles,
   insects, mammals, and fish (Experiment 2). Members of both Great Ape
   species were rapidly able to match the photos at levels above chance.
   Orangutans matched images from both category levels spontaneously
   whereas the gorilla showed effects of learning to match intermediate
   level categories. The results show that biological knowledge is not
   necessary to form natural categories at both concrete and intermediate
   levels.},

Title = {Brief Communication: Effect of Size Biases in the Coefficient of
   Variation on Assessing Intraspecific Variability in the Prosimian
   Skeleton},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {152},
Number = {1},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study examines the effect of a measurement size bias in
   coefficients of variation on the evaluation of intraspecific skeletal
   variability in a sample of eight prosimian species (Eulemur fulvus,
   Hapalemur griseus, Lemur catta, Varecia variegata, Galago senegalensis,
   Otolemur crassicaudatus, Nycticebus coucang, and Tarsius syrichta).
   Measurements with smaller means were expected to have higher
   coefficients of variation (CVs) due to the impact of instrumental
   precision on the ability to assess variability. This was evaluated by
   testing for a negative correlation between CVs and means in the total
   sample, within each species, and within each measurement, and by testing
   for the leveraging impact of small measurements on the significance of
   comparisons of variability between regions of the prosimian skeleton.
   Three comparisons were made: cranial versus postcranial variability,
   epiphysis versus diaphysis variability, and forelimb versus hindlimb
   variability. CVs were significantly negatively correlated with means
   within the total sample (r(2) = 0.208, P < 0.0001) and within each
   species. CVs and means were significantly correlated within only three
   of the measurements, which may reflect the relatively low body size
   range of the species studied. As predicted by the higher variability of
   smaller measurements, removing the smallest measurements from
   comparisons of variable classes containing measurements of different
   mean magnitudes pushed the comparisons below significance. These results
   indicate caution should be exercised when using CVs to assess
   variability across sets of measurements with different means. (C) 2013

Title = {Phylogenetic correlates of extinction risk in mammals: species in older

Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},

Volume = {280},

Abstract = {Phylogenetic information is becoming a recognized basis for evaluating
   conservation priorities, but associations between extinction risk and
   properties of a phylogeny such as diversification rates and phylogenetic
   lineage ages remain unclear. Limited taxon-specific analyses suggest
   that species in older lineages are at greater risk. We calculate
   quantitative properties of the mammalian phylogeny and model extinction
   risk as an ordinal index based on International Union for Conservation
   of Nature Red List categories. We test for associations between lineage
   age, clade size, evolutionary distinctiveness and extinction risk for
   3308 species of terrestrial mammals. We show no significant global or
   regional associations, and three significant relationships within
   taxonomic groups. Extinction risk increases for evolutionarily
   distinctive primates and decreases with lineage age when lemurs are
   excluded. Lagomorph species (rabbits, hares and pikas) that have more
   close relatives are less threatened. We examine the relationship between
   net diversification rates and extinction risk for 173 genera and find no
   pattern. We conclude that despite being under-represented in the
   frequency distribution of lineage ages, species in older, slower
   evolving and distinct lineages are not more threatened or
   extinction-prone. Their extinction, however, would represent a
   disproportionate loss of unique evolutionary history.},

Title = {Effects of Isometric Scaling on Vertical Jumping Performance},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Jump height, defined as vertical displacement in the airborne phase,
   depends on vertical takeoff velocity. For centuries, researchers have
   speculated on how jump height is affected by body size and many have
   adhered to what has come to be known as Borelli's law, which states that
   jump height does not depend on body size per se. The underlying
   assumption is that the amount of work produced per kg body mass during
   the push-off is independent of size. However, if a big body is
   isometrically downscaled to a small body, the latter requires higher
   joint angular velocities to achieve a given takeoff velocity and work
   production will be more impaired by the force-velocity relationship of
   muscle. In the present study, the effects of pure isometric scaling on
   vertical jumping performance were investigated using a biologically
   realistic model of the human musculoskeletal system. The input of the
   model, muscle stimulation over time, was optimized using jump height as
   criterion. It was found that when the human model was miniaturized to
   the size of a mouse lemur, with a mass of about one-thousandth that of a
   human, jump height dropped from 40 cm to only 6 cm, mainly because of
   the force-velocity relationship. In reality, mouse lemurs achieve jump
   heights of about 33 cm. By implication, the unfavourable effects of the
   small body size of mouse lemurs on jumping performance must be
   counteracted by favourable effects of morphological and physiological
   adaptations. The same holds true for other small jumping animals. The
   simulations for the first time expose and explain the sheer magnitude of
   the isolated effects of isometric downscaling on jumping performance, to
   be counteracted by morphological and physiological adaptations.},

Title = {The ``Secret{''} in Secretions: Methodological Considerations in
   Deciphering Primate Olfactory Communication},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {75},
Number = {7, SI},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Olfactory communication in primates is gaining recognition; however,
   studies on the production and perception of primate scent signals are
   still scant. In general, there are five tasks to be accomplished when
   deciphering the chemical signals contained in excretions and secretions:
   (1) obtaining the appropriate samples; (2) extracting the target organic
   compounds from the biological matrix; (3) separating the extracted
   compounds from one another (by gas chromatography, GC or liquid
   chromatography, LC); (4) identifying the compounds (by mass
   spectrometry, MS and associated procedures); and (5) revealing
   biologically meaningful patterns in the data. Ultimately, because some
   of the compounds identified in odorants may not be relevant, associated
   steps in understanding signal function involve verifying the perception
   or biological activity of putative semiochemicals via (6) behavioral
   bioassays or (7) receptor response studies. This review will focus on
   the chemical analyses and behavioral bioassays of volatile, primate
   scent signals. Throughout, we highlight the potential pitfalls of
   working with highly complex, chemical matrices and suggest ways for
   minimizing problems. A recurring theme in this review is that multiple
   approaches and instrumentation are required to characterize the full
   range of information contained in the complex mixtures that typify
   primate or, indeed, many vertebrate olfactory cues. Only by integrating
   studies of signal production with those verifying signal perception will
   we better understand the function of olfactory communication. Am. J.

Title = {The convergent evolution of blue iris pigmentation in primates took
   distinct molecular paths},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {151},
Number = {3},
Pages = {398-407},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {How many distinct molecular paths lead to the same phenotype? One
   approach to this question has been to examine the genetic basis of
   convergent traits, which likely evolved repeatedly under a shared
   selective pressure. We investigated the convergent phenotype of blue
   iris pigmentation, which has arisen independently in four primate
   lineages: humans, blue-eyed black lemurs, Japanese macaques, and spider
   monkeys. Characterizing the phenotype across these species, we found
   that the variation within the blue-eyed subsets of each species occupies
   strongly overlapping regions of CIE L{*}a{*}b{*} color space. Yet
   whereas Japanese macaques and humans display continuous variation, the
   phenotypes of blue-eyed black lemurs and their sister species (whose
   irises are brown) occupy more clustered subspaces. Variation in an
   enhancer of OCA2 is primarily responsible for the phenotypic difference
   between humans with blue and brown irises. In the orthologous region, we
   found no variant that distinguishes the two lemur species or associates
   with quantitative phenotypic variation in Japanese macaques. Given the
   high similarity between the blue iris phenotypes in these species and
   that in humans, this finding implies that evolution has used different
   molecular paths to reach the same end. Am J Phys Anthropol 151:398-407,

Abstract = {Introduction: Study on Morphometric and radiological aspect on existence
   of foramen of civinini. Sphenoid bone comprises of some rare ossified
   ligaments, may encounter difficulty in surgical procedures. Incidence of
   Pterygospinous bars various with different racial groups and they are
   genetically controlled. Complete ossification of pterygospinous ligament
   form foramen of civinini. Entrapments of vessels or nerves may occur due
   to existence of pterygospinous bar. The bar may locate medially or
   inferiorly to formen ovale as seen in Hawaiian and lemurs. Co-existence
   of bar with the wide lateral pterygoid plate exhibits development of the
   bar from herbivore, carnivore and old world monkeys. Comparatively
   absence or small spine of civinini noted in new world monkeys, rodents
   and platyrrhines. Pterygospinousbar represents the phylogenetic remnant
   of Human beings.
   Material and Methods: By using digital vernier caliper, the measurements
   of length, width of the pterygospinous bar and area of foramen of
   civinini including the length and breadth of lateral pterygoid plate
   were measured. Using X-rays the radiological view was determined.
   Results: In this study from 160 cases of skull and sphenoid bones
   revealed that complete and incomplete foramen of civinini in 1.25\% and
   7.5\% of cases respectively. Peculiarly accessory foramen of civinini
   noticed in 1.25\% of cases. Maximum area of foramen of civinini was
   94.2mm(2). The maximum width of lateral pterygoid was noted as 19.6mm
   respectively. Mentocoronal view of skiagram clearly shows the bar.
   Conclusion: During Anaesthesia for trigeminal neuralgia may encounter
   difficult to pass the needle. The bar compress the mandibular nerve
   branches can cause lingual numbness, pain and speech impairment.
   Conductive anaesthesia on the mandibular nerve through the lateral
   subzygomatic route may be difficult to approach. Exploring the
   anatomical and clinical updates of pterygospinous bar may guide the
   surgeons and radiologists to overcome any difficulties in infratemporal
   and para or retropharyngeal regions.},

Abstract = {Detection of the zoonotic pathogen Francisella tularensis subsp.
   holarctica (F. tularensis) in wild animals with culture techniques as
   well as polymerase chain reaction were compared and discussed on the
   basis of the investigation of 60 animals. The samples originated from 55
   European brown hares (Lepus europaeus), two red foxes (Vulpes vulpes)
   and one each from a wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), a European
   beaver (Castor fiber), and a lemur (Lemur catta).
   When comparing the growth of 28 F tularensis isolates on the cysteine
   blood agar and the modified Martin-Lewis-agar used in this study,
   cultivation was successful for 26 isolates on both media, but for two
   isolates only on the cysteine blood agar.
   Out of 43 carcasses 19 tested positive in bacteriological culture and
   PCR. Two culture positive samples of tonsils originating from foxes
   could not be confirmed by PCR, although PCR was positive in 22 samples
   that missed growth of F tularensis. Comparative studies on cultural
   detection of F tularensis were performed on samples of 16 hares from
   lung, spleen, liver and gut and in one case with a peritoneal swab. In
   at least one of these localizations cultivation of the pathogen was
   successful. Detection rate was reduced to 94\% (15 of 16 hares)
   considering only the results of the cultures of the lungs and spleens.
   For a sensitive and rapid detection of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica,
   the PCR is a suitable method thereby avoiding hazardous multiplying of

Abstract = {Reconstructing the earliest phases of primate evolution has been impeded
   by gaps in the fossil record, so that disagreements persist regarding
   the palaeobiology and phylogenetic relationships of the earliest
   primates. Here we report the discovery of a nearly complete and partly
   articulated skeleton of a primitive haplorhine primate from the early
   Eocene of China, about 55 million years ago, the oldest fossil primate
   of this quality ever recovered. Coupled with detailed morphological
   examination using propagation phase contrast X-ray synchrotron
   microtomography, our phylogenetic analysis based on total available
   evidence indicates that this fossil is the most basal known member of
   the tarsiiform clade. In addition to providing further support for an
   early dichotomy between the strepsirrhine and haplorhine clades, this
   new primate further constrains the age of divergence between tarsiiforms
   and anthropoids. It also strengthens the hypothesis that the earliest
   primates were probably diurnal, arboreal and primarily insectivorous
   mammals the size of modern pygmy mouse lemurs.},

Abstract = {In this study we compared the power arm lengths and mechanical
   advantages attributed to 12 lower leg muscles across three prosimian
   species. The origins and insertions of the lower leg muscles in
   Garnett's galago, the ring-tailed lemur, and the slow loris were
   quantified and correlated with positional behaviour. The ankle joint of
   the galago has a speed-oriented mechanical system, in contrast to that
   of the slow loris, which exhibits more power-oriented mechanics. The
   lemur ankle joint exhibited intermediate power arm lengths and an
   intermediate mechanical advantage relative to the other primates. This
   result suggests that the mechanical differences in the ankle between the
   galago and the lemur, taxa that exhibit similar locomotory repertoires,
   reflect a difference in the kinematics and kinetics of leaping (i.e.
   generalised vs. specialised leapers). In contrast to leaping primates,
   lorises have developed a more power-oriented mechanical system as a foot
   adaptation for positional behaviours such as bridging or cantilevering
   in their arboreal habitat.},

Title = {Distribution of Mycobacterium avium ssp paratuberculosis in a German

Abstract = {Little data concerning the distribution of Mycobacterium avium ssp.
   paratuberculosis (MAP) in zoological gardens is available. The presence
   of MAP in captured wildlife might provide further information on
   non-ruminant hosts and expand the list of animals susceptible to MAP
   being potential sources of MAP transmission. Therefore, a German
   zoological garden with recent history of clinical paratuberculosis in
   Barbary sheep (Ammo tragus lervia) and an alpaca (Lama pacos) was
   selected to estimate the distribution of MAP infections in 21 mammalian
   and avian species. Pooled faecal samples from individual animals of each
   species were tested for the presence of MAP. A previously developed
   15900 semi-nested PCR (snPCR) assay, amplifying a 587 bp and a 278 bp
   fragment, was used for the detection of MAP-DNA. Based on this snPCR, in
   14 out of the 21 pooled faecal samples MAP-DNA was detected. MAP
   positive snPCR results were observed in ruminants and camelids as well
   as in non-ruminants such as equines, primates, rodents, and birds.
   Moreover, a quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that the
   concentration of MAP-DNA was within the range of 2.2 x 10(3)-9.6 x 10(6)
   MAP-DNA equivalents per gram faeces. The highest amount was shed by
   primates such as Black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata) and
   Cottontop tamarins (Saguinus oedipus).
   This is the first survey investigating the presence of MAP in a German
   zoo, which includes non-ruminants. The results of the present study
   confirm the wide host range of MAP and demonstrate that MAP occurs more
   frequently in zoo animals than expected. In order to restrict further
   spread of MAP in European zoos, additional investigations regarding the
   existing transmission pathways of MAP in zoos are recommended. (C) 2013

Title = {Coalescent-Based Genome Analyses Resolve the Early Branches of the
   Euarchontoglires},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Despite numerous large-scale phylogenomic studies, certain parts of the
   mammalian tree are extraordinarily difficult to resolve. We used the
   coding regions from 19 completely sequenced genomes to study the
   relationships within the super-clade Euarchontoglires (Primates,
   Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Dermoptera and Scandentia) because the placement
   of Scandentia within this clade is controversial. The difficulty in
   resolving this issue is due to the short time spans between the early
   divergences of Euarchontoglires, which may cause incongruent gene trees.
   The conflict in the data can be depicted by network analyses and the
   contentious relationships are best reconstructed by coalescent-based
   analyses. This method is expected to be superior to analyses of
   concatenated data in reconstructing a species tree from numerous gene
   trees. The total concatenated dataset used to study the relationships in
   this group comprises 5,875 protein-coding genes (9,799,170 nucleotides)
   from all orders except Dermoptera (flying lemurs). Reconstruction of the
   species tree from 1,006 gene trees using coalescent models placed
   Scandentia as sister group to the primates, which is in agreement with
   maximum likelihood analyses of concatenated nucleotide sequence data.
   Additionally, both analytical approaches favoured the Tarsier to be
   sister taxon to Anthropoidea, thus belonging to the Haplorrhine clade.
   When divergence times are short such as in radiations over periods of a
   few million years, even genome scale analyses struggle to resolve
   phylogenetic relationships. On these short branches processes such as
   incomplete lineage sorting and possibly hybridization occur and make it
   preferable to base phylogenomic analyses on coalescent methods.},

Title = {A Molecular Phylogeny of Plesiorycteropus Reassigns the Extinct
   Mammalian Order `Bibymalagasia'},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {Madagascar is well known for its diverse fauna and flora, being home to
   many species not found anywhere else in the world. However, its
   biodiversity in the recent past included a range of extinct enigmatic
   fauna, such as elephant birds, giant lemurs and dwarfed hippopotami. The
   `Malagasy aardvark' (Plesiorycteropus) has remained one of Madagascar's
   least well-understood extinct species since its discovery in the 19th
   century. Initially considered a close relative of the aardvark
   (Orycteropus) within the order Tubulidentata, more recent morphological
   analyses challenged this placement on the grounds that the identifiably
   derived traits supporting this allocation were adaptations to digging
   rather than shared ancestry. Because the skeletal evidence showed many
   morphological traits diagnostic of different eutherian mammal orders,
   they could not be used to resolve its closest relatives. As a result,
   the genus was tentatively assigned its own taxonomic order
   `Bibymalagasia', yet how this order relates to other eutherian mammal
   orders remains unclear despite numerous morphological investigations.
   This research presents the first known molecular sequence data for
   Plesiorycteropus, obtained from the bone protein collagen (I), which
   places the `Malagasy aardvark' as more closely related to tenrecs than
   aardvarks. More specifically, Plesiorycteropus was recovered within the
   order Tenrecoidea (golden moles and tenrecs) within Afrotheria,
   suggesting that the taxonomic order `Bibymalagasia' is obsolete. This
   research highlights the potential for collagen sequencing in
   investigating the phylogeny of extinct species as a viable alternative
   to ancient DNA (aDNA) sequencing, particularly in cases where aDNA
   cannot be recovered.},

Title = {A DNA Metabarcoding Study of a Primate Dietary Diversity and Plasticity
   across Its Entire Fragmented Range},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 19},
Abstract = {In tropical regions, most primary ecosystems have been replaced by
   mosaic landscapes in which species must cope with a large shift in the
   distribution of their habitat and associated food resources. Primates
   are particularly vulnerable to habitat modifications. Most species
   persist in small fragments surrounded by complex human-mediated matrices
   whose structure and connectivity may strongly influence their dispersal
   and feeding behavior. Behavioral plasticity appears to be a crucial
   parameter governing the ability of organisms to exploit the resources
   offered by new matrix habitats and thus to persist in fragmented
   habitats. In this study, we were interested in the dietary plasticity of
   the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), an endangered
   species of lemur, found only in the Daraina region in north-eastern
   Madagascar. We used a DNA-based approach combining the barcoding concept
   and Illumina next-generation sequencing to (i) describe the species diet
   across its entire range and (ii) evaluate the influence of landscape
   heterogeneity on diet diversity and composition. Faeces from 96
   individuals were sampled across the entire species range and their
   contents were analyzed using the trnL metabarcoding approach. In
   parallel, we built a large DNA reference database based on a checklist
   of the plant species of the Daraina region. Our results suggest that
   golden-crowned sifakas exhibit remarkable dietary diversity with at
   least 130 plant species belonging to 80 genera and 49 different
   families. We highlighted an influence of both habitat type and openness
   on diet composition suggesting a high flexibility of foraging
   strategies. Moreover, we observed the presence of numerous cultivated
   and naturalized plants in the faeces of groups living in forest edge
   areas. Overall, our findings support our initial expectation that P.
   tattersalli is able to cope with the current level of alteration of the
   landscape and confirm our previous results on the distribution and the
   dispersal ability of this species.},

Title = {HuntMi: an efficient and taxon-specific approach in pre-miRNA
   identification},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {14},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Background: Machine learning techniques are known to be a powerful way
   of distinguishing microRNA hairpins from pseudo hairpins and have been
   applied in a number of recognised miRNA search tools. However, many
   current methods based on machine learning suffer from some drawbacks,
   including not addressing the class imbalance problem properly. It may
   lead to overlearning the majority class and/or incorrect assessment of
   classification performance. Moreover, those tools are effective for a
   narrow range of species, usually the model ones. This study aims at
   improving performance of miRNA classification procedure, extending its
   usability and reducing computational time.
   Results: We present HuntMi, a stand-alone machine learning miRNA
   classification tool. We developed a novel method of dealing with the
   class imbalance problem called ROC-select, which is based on
   thresholding score function produced by traditional classifiers. We also
   introduced new features to the data representation. Several
   classification algorithms in combination with ROC-select were tested and
   random forest was selected for the best balance between sensitivity and
   specificity. Reliable assessment of classification performance is
   guaranteed by using large, strongly imbalanced, and taxon-specific
   datasets in 10-fold cross-validation procedure. As a result, HuntMi
   achieves a considerably better performance than any other miRNA
   classification tool and can be applied in miRNA search experiments in a
   wide range of species.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that HuntMi represents an effective
   and flexible tool for identification of new microRNAs in animals, plants
   and viruses. ROC-select strategy proves to be superior to other methods
   of dealing with class imbalance problem and can possibly be used in
   other machine learning classification tasks. The HuntMi software as well
   as datasets used in the research are freely available at

Title = {Linking feeding ecology and population abundance: a review of food
   resource limitation on primates},

Abstract = {We review studies that consider how food affects primate population
   abundance. In order to explain spatial variation in primate abundance,
   various correlates that parameterize quality and quantity of food in the
   habitat have been examined. We propose two hypotheses concerning how
   resource availability and its seasonality determine animal abundance.
   When the quality of fallback foods (foods eaten during the scarcity of
   preferred foods) is too low to satisfy nutritional requirement, total
   annual food quantity should determine population size, but this
   relationship can be modified by the quality or the quantity of fallback
   foods. This mechanism has been established for Japanese macaques and
   sportive lemurs that survive lean seasons by fat storage or extremely
   low metabolism. Second, when fallback food quality is high enough to
   satisfy nutritional requirement but quantity is limited, quantity of
   fallback food should be a limiting factor of animal abundance. This is
   supported by the correlation between fig density, which is a
   high-quality fallback food, and gibbon and orangutan abundance. For a
   direct test of these hypotheses, we need more research that determines
   both the quality of food that animals require to satisfy their
   nutritional requirement and the quantity of food production. Leaves are
   often regarded as superabundant, but this assumption needs careful
   examination.},

Title = {Conserved Regional 3 ` Grouping of Rare Codons in the Coding Sequence of
   Ocular Prosecretory Mitogen Lacritin},
Journal = {INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY \& VISUAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {54},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {PURPOSE. Lacritin is a prosecretory mitogen in tears and, although a
   tear protein, it promotes basal tearing and lacrimal gland secretion.
   Since scale up is relevant to its potential use in the treatment of dry
   eye, we explored various mutagenic strategies to alter the stability,
   solubility, and translational efficiency of nascent lacritin, and
   discovered 3' clustering of rare human codons.
   METHODS. Site-directed mutagenesis of lacritin coding cDNA ``pLAC{''}
   generated 24 different nonsynonymous and 13 synonymous mutations.
   Nonsynonymous mutations altered amino acids with nonpolar, basic or
   acidic side chains to serine. Synonymous mutation progressively
   optimized human codons that are rare or uncommon in Escherichia coli
   without changing the amino acid specified. These changes were validated
   by sequencing and protein production, and analyzed via the ``rare codon
   calculator{''} (RCC). Nonhuman primate and nonprimate lacritin coding
   sequences were extracted from Ensembl, and analyzed via RCC using codon
   usage appropriate for each species.
   RESULTS. Superior yields were obtained by modification of individual
   hydrophobic residues or a predicted salt bridge, suggesting that
   production was limited by lacritin stability. Accordingly, elimination
   of rare codons increased yields less effectively. Importantly, RCC
   analysis of human, nonhuman primate (mouse lemur) and nonprimate (cat,
   tree shrew) lacritin coding sequences revealed remarkable 3' clustering
   of rare codons, unlike human lipocalin-1 and 21 other widely expressed
   human tear genes.
   CONCLUSIONS. Lacritin protein yields were improved primarily by
   hydrophobic or salt bridge mutagenesis and less so by elimination of
   rare codons. The 30 clustering of rare codons is conserved in all
   lacritin orthologs examined. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2013; 54:

Abstract = {Splicing is one of the major contributors to observed spatiotemporal
   diversification of transcripts and proteins in metazoans. There are
   numerous factors that affect the process, but splice sites themselves
   along with the adjacent splicing signals are critical here.
   Unfortunately, there is still little known about splicing in plants and,
   consequently, further research in some fields of plant molecular biology
   will encounter difficulties. Keeping this in mind, we performed a
   large-scale analysis of splice sites in eight plant species, using novel
   algorithms and tools developed by us. The analyses included
   identification of orthologous splice sites, polypyrimidine tracts and
   branch sites. Additionally we identified putative intronic and exonic
   cis-regulatory motifs, U12 introns as well as splice sites in 45
   microRNA genes in five plant species. We also provide experimental
   evidence for plant splice sites in the form of expressed sequence tag
   and RNA-Seq data. All the data are stored in a novel database called
   ERISdb and are freely available at ext-link-type={''}uri{''}

Abstract = {Core duplicons in the human genome represent ancestral duplication
   modules shared by the majority of intrachromosomal duplication blocks
   within a given chromosome. These cores are associated with the emergence
   of novel gene families in the hominoid lineage, but their genomic
   organization and gene characterization among other primates are largely
   unknown. Here, we investigate the genomic organization and expression of
   the core duplicon on chromosome 17 that led to the expansion of LRRC37
   during primate evolution. A comparison of the LRRC37 gene family
   organization in human, orangutan, macaque, marmoset, and lemur genomes
   shows the presence of both orthologous and species-specific gene copies
   in all primate lineages. Expression profiling in mouse, macaque, and
   human tissues reveals that the ancestral expression of LRRC37 was
   restricted to the testis. In the hominid lineage, the pattern of LRRC37
   became increasingly ubiquitous, with significantly higher levels of
   expression in the cerebellum and thymus, and showed a remarkable
   diversity of alternative splice forms. Transfection studies in HeLa
   cells indicate that the human FLAG-tagged recombinant LRRC37 protein is
   secreted after cleavage of a transmembrane precursor and its
   overexpression can induce filipodia formation.},

Title = {The evolution of brains from early mammals to humans},

Abstract = {The large size and complex organization of the human brain makes it
   unique among primate brains. In particular, the neocortex constitutes
   about 80\% of the brain, and this cortex is subdivided into a large
   number of functionally specialized regions, the cortical areas. Such a
   brain mediates accomplishments and abilities unmatched by any other
   species. How did such a brain evolve? Answers come from comparative
   studies of the brains of present-day mammals and other vertebrates in
   conjunction with information about brain sizes and shapes from the
   fossil record, studies of brain development, and principles derived from
   studies of scaling and optimal design. Early mammals were small, with
   small brains, an emphasis on olfaction, and little neocortex. Neocortex
   was transformed from the single layer of output pyramidal neurons of the
   dorsal cortex of earlier ancestors to the six layers of all present-day
   mammals. This small cap of neocortex was divided into 2025 cortical
   areas, including primary and some of the secondary sensory areas that
   characterize neocortex in nearly all mammals today. Early placental
   mammals had a corpus callosum connecting the neocortex of the two
   hemispheres, a primary motor area, M1, and perhaps one or more premotor
   areas. One line of evolution, Euarchontoglires, led to present-day
   primates, tree shrews, flying lemurs, rodents, and rabbits. Early
   primates evolved from small-brained, nocturnal, insect-eating mammals
   with an expanded region of temporal visual cortex. These early nocturnal
   primates were adapted to the fine branch niche of the tropical
   rainforest by having an even more expanded visual system that mediated
   visually guided reaching and grasping of insects, small vertebrates, and
   fruits. Neocortex was greatly expanded and included an array of cortical
   areas that characterize neocortex of all living primates.
   Specializations of the visual system included new visual areas that
   contributed to a dorsal stream of visuomotor processing in a greatly
   enlarged region of posterior parietal cortex and an expanded motor
   system and the addition of a ventral premotor area. Higher visual areas
   in a large temporal lobe facilitated object recognition, and frontal
   cortex included granular prefrontal cortex. Auditory cortex included the
   primary and secondary auditory areas that characterize prosimian and
   anthropoid primates today. As anthropoids emerged as diurnal primates,
   the visual system specialized for detailed foveal vision. Other
   adaptations included an expansion of prefrontal cortex and insular
   cortex. The human and chimpanzeebonobo lineages diverged some 68 million
   years ago with brains that were about one third the size of modern
   humans. Over the last 2 million years, the brains of our more recent
   ancestors increased greatly in size, especially in the prefrontal,
   posterior parietal, lateral temporal, and insular regions.
   Specialization of the two cerebral hemispheres for related, but
   different functions became pronounced, and language and other impressive
   cognitive abilities emerged. WIREs Cogn Sci 2013, 4:3345. doi:

   developmental issues},
Journal = {FOLIA MORPHOLOGICA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {202-209},
Abstract = {The septomarginal trabecula is present in all human hearts as well as in
   the hearts of other primates. It usually connects the interventricular
   septum with the anterior papillary muscle, although there are many
   variations in how this is achieved. The object of the analyses was to
   estimate the bilateral topography of the septomarginal trabecula and the
   anterior papillary muscle in the context of the ontogeny and phylogeny
   of primates. A total of 138 hearts were examined from number of
   different non-human primates. The presence of the septomarginal
   trabecula was confirmed in 94.9\% of cases, although not in the hearts
   of Lemur varius. Four configurations could be distinguished by defining
   the location of the septomarginal trabecula and its relation to the
   anterior papillary muscle. For the hearts of the Strepsirrhini and the
   majority of Platyrrhini neither structure was related, whereas in all
   examined representatives of Hominoidea they had fused and created
   morphologically varying forms. On the basis of these results, a concept
   was developed for the sequence of changes which the topography of the
   septomarginal trabecula and the anterior papillary muscle undergo during
   ontogeny and phylogeny.},

Title = {Toward an ecophyletic origin of anthropoid primates},
Journal = {GEOLOGICA BELGICA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {284-289},
Abstract = {The origin of anthropoid primates is examined from an ecomorphological
   perspective. An appeal is made to address the complexity of the initial
   anthropoid adaptation head-on, by bringing a variety of analytical
   approaches to bear and to encourage a move away from reconstructing
   anthropoid origins by relying on more reductionist phylogenetic methods
   only. Two major differing approaches to the study of anthropoid origins
   are reviewed, and an ecomorphological analysis that highlights the
   evolutionary novelties associated with early anthropoids is presented.
   The basic question addressed here is, ``What makes an anthropoid an
   anthropoid{''}? That is, how exactly did early anthropoids differ from
   other contemporary primates? The emphasis is on anthropoid morphology as
   it is documented in the Paleogene of Africa, the time and place that the
   earliest known anthropoids occur, because anthropoid origins involved
   much more than a cladogenic event.},

Journal = {REPRODUCTION FERTILITY AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {825-836},
Abstract = {It is generally considered that, in mammals, the ovary is endowed with a
   finite number of oocytes at the time of birth. However, studies
   concerning rodents, lemurs and humans suggest the existence of stem
   cells from the germline that may be involved in germ-cell renewal,
   maintaining postnatal follicle development. This type of work on wild
   species is scarce; therefore the objective of this study was to
   determine ovarian morphology and the presence of progenitor cells from
   the germline of three species of phyllostomid bats (Artibeus
   jamaicensis, Glossophaga soricina and Sturnira lilium). The
   morphological characteristics of the ovaries and the expression of
   specific markers of germline cells, stem cells and proliferation cells
   were analysed. The morphology of the ovaries of the three bat species
   was similar. A polarised ovary with follicles at different stages of
   development and groups of cortical cells similar to primordial germ
   cells were observed. Immunofluorescent analysis showed that these
   cortical cells express germline, stem-cell and proliferative markers,
   indicating the identification of germ cells that could maintain
   pluripotency, as well as being mitotically active. This suggests that in
   the adult ovary of phyllostomid bats there may be a mechanism for the
   self-renewal of the germline.},

Abstract = {Taeniid tapeworms which include Echinococcus and Taenia spp. are
   obligatory parasites of mammals with pathogenicity usually related to
   the larval stages of the life cycle. Two species (or genotypes) of
   Echinococcus. E. granulosus sensu stricto and E. equinus, as well as
   several Taenia spp. are endemic in the UK. Here we report on the
   occurrence of larval cystic stages of Echinococcus and Taenia spp. in
   captive mammals in the UK. Using molecular techniques we have identified
   E. granulosus (Cl genotype) in a guenon monkey and a Philippine spotted
   deer; E. equinus in a zebra and a lemur; E. ortleppi in a Philippine
   spotted deer; E. multilocularis in a macaque monkey and Taenia
   polyacantha in jumping rats. To the best of our knowledge this is the
   first report of E. muitilocularis in a captive primate translocated to
   the UK. As far as we know these are the first reports of E. equinus in a
   primate (lemur) and in a zebra; as well as E. granulosus (Cl genotype)
   and E. ortleppi in a cervid translocated to the UK. These infections and
   implications of the potential establishment of exotic species of
   cestodes are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   monkeys. Aim is to study the supracondylar process of humerus. MATERIALS
   AND METHODS: 80 adult dry humeri were collected from Anatomy Department,
   Gauhati Medical College and were examined. RESULTS: Out of 80 humeri, we
   found one humerus of left side with a bony projection from anteromedial
   surface of its distal shaft. The bone was then examined, studied,
   photographed and its dimensions were recorded. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of
   this variation may be of great importance to anatomists and
   anthropologists, because of possible link to the origins and relations
   of the human races.},

Abstract = {The study of unusual or little-known animals can pay enormous dividends
   by providing new insights into fundamental biological processes. One has
   to consider only the implications of the studies on Aplysia or

   from the work of Gunter Tembrock, in whose honor this lecture is
   offered. Recent studies of the hibernation of a small primate from
   Madagascar, the fat-tailed dwarf lemur, which may remain in a condition
   of torpor for weeks at a time, promise a range of similar insights.},

Abstract = {Mammalian spermatogenesis is maintained by spermatogonial stem cells
   (SSCs). However, since evidentiary assays and unequivocal markers are
   still missing in non-human primates (NHPs) and man, the identity of
   primate SSCs is unknown. In contrast, in mice, germ cell transplantation
   studies have functionally demonstrated the presence of SSCs. LIN28 is an
   RNA-binding pluripotent stem cell factor, which is also strongly
   expressed in undifferentiated mouse spermatogonia. By contrast, two
   recent reports indicated that LIN28 is completely absent from adult
   human testes. Here, we analyzed LIN28 expression in marmoset monkey
   (Callithrix jacchus) and human testes during development and adulthood
   and compared it with that in mice. In the marmoset, LIN28 was strongly
   expressed in migratory primordial germ cells and gonocytes. Strikingly,
   we found a rare LIN28-positive subpopulation of spermatogonia also in
   adult marmoset testis. This was corroborated by western blotting and
   quantitative RTPCR. Importantly, in contrast to previous publications,
   we found LIN28-positive spermatogonia also in normal adult human and
   additional adult NHP testes. Some seasonal breeders exhibit a
   degenerated (involuted) germinal epithelium consisting only of Sertoli
   cells and SSCs during their non-breeding season. The latter re-initiate
   spermatogenesis prior to the next breeding-season. Fully involuted
   testes from a seasonal hamster and NHP (Lemur catta) exhibited numerous
   LIN28-positive spermatogonia, indicating an SSC identity of the labeled
   cells. We conclude that LIN28 is differentially expressed in mouse and
   NHP spermatogonia and might be a marker for a rare SSC population in
   NHPs and man. Further characterization of the LIN28-positive population
   is required.},

Title = {Primate aging in the mammalian scheme: the puzzle of extreme variation
   in brain aging},
Journal = {AGE},

Volume = {34},

Abstract = {At later ages, humans have high risk of developing Alzheimer disease
   (AD) which may afflict up to 50\% by 90 years. While prosimians and
   monkeys show more substantial changes, the great apes brains examined
   show mild neurodegenerative changes. Compared with rodents, primates
   develop and reproduce slowly and are long lived. The New World primates
   contain some of the shortest as well as some of the longest-lived monkey
   species, while the prosimians develop the most rapidly and are the
   shortest lived. Great apes have the largest brains, slowest development,
   and longest lives among the primates. All primates share some level of
   slowly progressive, age-related neurodegenerative changes. However, no
   species besides humans has yet shown regular drastic neuron loss or
   cognitive decline approaching clinical grade AD. Several primates
   accumulate extensive deposits of diffuse amyloid-beta protein (A beta)
   but only a prosimian-the gray mouse lemur-regularly develops a tauopathy
   approaching the neurofibrillary tangles of AD. Compared with monkeys,
   nonhuman great apes display even milder brain-aging changes, a deeply
   puzzling observation. The genetic basis for these major species
   differences in brain aging remains obscure but does not involve the A
   beta coding sequence which is identical in nonhuman primates and humans.
   While chimpanzees merit more study, we note the value of smaller,
   shorter-lived species such as marmosets and small lemurs for aging
   studies. A continuing concern for all aging studies employing primates
   is that relative to laboratory rodents, primate husbandry is in a
   relatively primitive state, and better husbandry to control infections
   and obesity is needed for brain aging research.},

Abstract = {The impact of climate change and anthropogenic deforestation on
   biodiversity is of growing concern worldwide. Disentangling how past
   anthropogenic and natural factors contributed to current biome
   distribution is thus a crucial issue to understand their complex
   interactions on wider time scales and to improve predictions and
   conservation strategies. This is particularly important in biodiversity
   hotspots, such as Madagascar, dominated by large open habitats whose
   origins are increasingly debated. Although a dominant narrative argues
   that Madagascar was originally entirely covered by woodlands, which were
   destroyed by humans, a number of recent studies have suggested that past
   climatic fluctuations played a major role in shaping current biome
   distributions well before humans arrived. Here, we address the question
   of the origin of open habitats in the Daraina region in northern
   Madagascar, using a multiproxy approach combining population genetics
   modeling and remote-sensing analyses. We show that (i) contrary to most
   regions of Madagascar, the forest cover in Daraina remained remarkably
   stable over the past 60 y, and (ii) the golden-crowned sifaka
   (Propithecus tattersalli), a forest-dwelling lemur, underwent a strong
   population contraction before the arrival of the first humans, hence
   excluding an anthropogenic cause. Prehuman Holocene droughts may have
   led to a significant increase of grasslands and a reduction in the
   species' habitat. This contradicts the prevailing narrative that land
   cover changes are necessarily anthropogenic in Madagascar but does not
   preclude the later role played by humans in other regions in which
   recent lemur bottlenecks have been observed.},

Abstract = {The present study was conducted to test predictions of the oxidative
   stress theory of aging assessing reactive oxygen species production and
   oxidative stress resistance in cultured fibroblasts from 13 primate
   species ranging in body size from 0.25 to 120 kg and in longevity from
   20 to 90 years. We assessed both basal and stress-induced reactive
   oxygen species production in fibroblasts from five great apes (human,
   chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and orangutan), four Old World monkeys
   (baboon, rhesus and crested black macaques, and patas monkey), three New
   World monkeys (common marmoset, red-bellied tamarin, and woolly monkey),
   and one lemur (ring-tailed lemur). Measurements of cellular MitoSox
   fluorescence, an indicator of mitochondrial superoxide (O-2(center
   dot-)) generation, showed an inverse correlation between longevity and
   steady state or metabolic stress induced mitochondrial O-2(center dot-)
   production, but this correlation was lost when the effects of body mass
   were removed, and the data were analyzed using phylogenetically
   independent contrasts. Fibroblasts from longer-lived primate species
   also exhibited superior resistance to H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death
   than cells from shorter-living primates. After correction for body mass
   and lack of phylogenetic independence, this correlation, although still
   discernible, fell short of significance by regression analysis. Thus,
   increased longevity in this sample of primates is not causally
   associated with low cellular reactive oxygen species generation, but
   further studies are warranted to test the association between increased
   cellular resistance to oxidative stressor and primate longevity.},

Title = {The Natural History of Class I Primate Alcohol Dehydrogenases Includes
   Gene Duplication, Gene Loss, and Gene Conversion},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {Background: Gene duplication is a source of molecular innovation
   throughout evolution. However, even with massive amounts of genome
   sequence data, correlating gene duplication with speciation and other
   events in natural history can be difficult. This is especially true in
   its most interesting cases, where rapid and multiple duplications are
   likely to reflect adaptation to rapidly changing environments and life
   styles. This may be so for Class I of alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH1s),
   where multiple duplications occurred in primate lineages in Old and New
   World monkeys (OWMs and NWMs) and hominoids.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To build a preferred model for the
   natural history of ADH1s, we determined the sequences of nine new ADH1
   genes, finding for the first time multiple paralogs in various
   prosimians (lemurs, strepsirhines). Database mining then identified
   novel ADH1 paralogs in both macaque (an OWM) and marmoset (a NWM). These
   were used with the previously identified human paralogs to resolve
   controversies relating to dates of duplication and gene conversion in
   the ADH1 family. Central to these controversies are differences in the
   topologies of trees generated from exonic (coding) sequences and
   intronic sequences.
   Conclusions/Significance: We provide evidence that gene conversions are
   the primary source of difference, using molecular clock dating of
   duplications and analyses of microinsertions and deletions
   (micro-indels). The tree topology inferred from intron sequences appear
   to more correctly represent the natural history of ADH1s, with the ADH1
   paralogs in platyrrhines (NWMs) and catarrhines (OWMs and hominoids)
   having arisen by duplications shortly predating the divergence of OWMs
   and NWMs. We also conclude that paralogs in lemurs arose independently.
   Finally, we identify errors in database interpretation as the source of
   controversies concerning gene conversion. These analyses provide a model
   for the natural history of ADH1s that posits four ADH1 paralogs in the
   ancestor of Catarrhine and Platyrrhine primates, followed by the loss of
   an ADH1 paralog in the human lineage.},

Abstract = {Despite increasing interest, animal personality is still a puzzling
   phenomenon. Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain
   intraindividual consistency and interindividual variation in behaviour,
   which have been primarily supported by qualitative data and simulations.
   Using an empirical approach, I tested predictions of one main
   life-history hypothesis, which posits that consistent individual
   differences in behaviour are favoured by a trade-off between current and
   future reproduction. Data on life-history were collected for individuals
   of a natural population of grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). Using
   open-field and novel-object tests, I quantified variation in activity,
   exploration and boldness for 117 individuals over 3 years. I found
   systematic variation in boldness between individuals of different
   residual reproductive value. Young males with low current but high
   expected future fitness were less bold than older males with high
   current fecundity, and males might increase in boldness with age.
   Females have low variation in assets and in boldness with age. Body
   condition was not related to boldness and only explained marginal
   variation in exploration. Overall, these data indicate that a trade-off
   between current and future reproduction might maintain personality
   variation in mouse lemurs, and thus provide empirical support of this
   life-history trade-off hypothesis.},

Title = {A review of the geckos of the genus Hemidactylus (Squamata: Gekkonidae)
   from Oman based on morphology, mitochondrial and nuclear data, with
   descriptions of eight new species},
Journal = {ZOOTAXA},
Year = {2012},
Number = {3378},
Pages = {1+},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {The genus Hemidactylus is one of the most species-rich and widely
   distributed of all reptile genera, being found in the tropical and
   subtropical regions of the world and hundreds of continental and oceanic
   islands. Despite having already 111 species, the number of species
   described in recent years is very high. This has been facilitated, in
   part, by the use of molecular techniques, which in most cases have been
   employed to confirm the differentiation at the DNA level of some
   morphologically variable forms and to discover some cryptic lineages.
   Preliminary analyses indicate that some Hemidactylus species from Oman
   are quite variable in their morphology and may include more than one
   species. In order to test this hypothesis we inferred a molecular
   phylogeny including 131 Hemidactylus (20 species) using 1385 base pairs
   of mitochondrial DNA (353 bp 12S; 302 bp cytb; 588 bp nd4 and 142 bp
   tRNAs) and 1481 bp of nuclear DNA (403 bp c-mos; 668 bp mc1r and 410 bp
   rag2) and analyzed 226 specimens (15 species) for several meristic and
   pholidotic characters of which we took 3103 photographs that have been
   deposited in MorphoBank (project 483). Our results indicate the presence
   of eight new species of Hemidactylus geckos in Arabia: H. luqueorum sp.
   nov. and H. hajarensis sp. nov. from North Oman; H. masirahensis sp.
   nov. from Masirah Island; H. inexpectatus sp. nov. from one locality on
   coastal Central Oman; H. alkiyumii sp. nov., H. festivus sp. nov. and H.
   paucituberculatus sp. nov. from Dhofar, Southern Oman; and finally H.
   endophis sp. nov. probably from North Oman and described on the basis of
   morphology alone. An identification key to the genus Hemidactylus from
   Oman is also presented. With these descriptions, the number of
   Hemidactylus species found in Oman increases from 7 to 13 and the number
   of endemic Hemidactylus from 0 to 6. The description of three new
   species endemic to the Hajar Mountains in North Oman highlights the
   importance of this mountain range as a biodiversity hotspot that, up to
   now, includes 12 reptile species that are found nowhere else in the
   World. Another hotspot of Hemidactylus biodiversity is the Dhofar
   Mountain range, in the extreme Southwestern corner of Oman and East
   Yemen. As a result of its particular geographic situation, orography and
   the effect of the Southwest Monsoons, this mountain range presents a
   diverse variety of habitats with different species of Hemidactylus
   adapted to them.
   With the exception of H. flaviviridis and H. leschenaultii, which belong
   to the Tropical Asian clade of Hemidactylus, all Arabian Hemidactylus
   for which DNA sequence is available are members of the Arid clade of
   Hemidactylus. Relatively recent dispersal appears to have taken place
   within Arabia in the H. turcicus group, with the South Arabian H.
   lemurinus occurring far from other confirmed members of this assemblage.
   Hemidactylus flaviviridis and a clade of H. robustus are genetically
   uniform, widespread in Arabia and beyond and occur around human
   habitations, suggesting that much of their large distributions are
   anthropogenic, as appears to be so in several other Hemidactylus species
   outside Arabia.
   The way in which species of Arabian Hemidactylus separate ecologically
   is surprisingly varied. They may occur at similar altitudes but replace
   each other geographically, or if they are sympatric there may be
   altitudinal separation. Humidity may also be an important factor, and
   when animals exist within a few meters of each other, structural niche
   may be significant. While four native species occur close together in
   Dhofar, most Hemidactylus communities in Arabia consist of only one or
   two species, although climbing geckos belonging to other genera, such as
   Asaccus and Ptyodactylus, may also be present.},

   Cruziohyla calcarifer, Phrynomedusa appendiculata and in one species of
   Phasmahyla. The other species have roundish EPs. The density of the EPs
   on the pad is variable. Species in the Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis
   Group have EPs with a density that varies between 764 +/- 58/mm2 and 923
   +/- 160/mm2. In all other studied species (including the Phyllomedusa
   burmeisteri and Phyllomedusa perinesos groups, Phyllomedusa camba,
   Phyllomedusa boliviana, Phyllomedusa sauvagii, Phyllomedusa bicolor, and
   Phyllomedusa tomopterna) the density of EPs varies between 108 +/-
   20/mm2 and 552 +/- 97/mm2. Pores were observed with SEM in C.
   calcarifer, Agalychnis lemur, Agalychnis moreletii, but its presence is
   confirmed through histological sections on several other species. Its
   visibility using SEM seems to be related with the level of separation
   between adjacent EPs. The pores in the four studied species of
   Agalychnis are shown with SEM and histological sections to have a
   characteristic epidermal rim, that is absent in the
   otherphyllomedusines. Unlike most previous reports on breeding glands,
   those of phyllomedusines are alcian blue positive, indicating the
   presence of acidic mucosubstances on its secretions. J. Morphol. 2012.

Abstract = {Our objective was to identify local animal reservoirs of leptospirosis
   to explain the unusual features of Leptospira strains recently described
   among patients on the island of Mayotte. By means of a microscopic
   agglutination test using local clinical isolates, we found that 11.2\%
   of black rats were seropositive to Leptospira, whereas 10.2\% of flying
   foxes, 2\% of lemurs, 93.1\% of domestic dogs, and 87.5\% of stray dogs
   were seropositive. As observed in humans, Mini was the main serogroup
   circulating in animals, whereas serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae was
   absent. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we also showed
   that 29.8\% of rats carried leptospires in their kidneys. The sequencing
   of 16S rRNA gene sequences of Leptospira found in black rat kidneys
   identified four genomospecies (Leptospira borgpetersenii, Leptospira
   interrogans, Leptospira kirschneri, and L. borgpetersenii group B),
   which established black rats as the major source of leptospirosis
   transmission to humans. The origins of such a genetic diversity in
   Leptospira strains are discussed.},

Abstract = {Teilhardina belgica is one of the most primitive fossil primates known
   to date and the earliest haplorhine with associated postcranials, making
   it relevant to a reconstruction of the ancestral primate morphotype.
   Here we describe newly discovered postcranial elements of T. belgica. It
   is a small primate with an estimated body mass between 30 and 60 g,
   similar to the size of a mouse lemur. Its hindlimb anatomy suggests
   frequent and forceful leaping with excellent foot mobility and grasping
   capabilities. It can now be established that this taxon exhibits
   critical primate postcranial synapomorphies such as a grasping hallux, a
   tall knee, and nailed digits. This anatomical pattern and behavioral
   profile is similar to what has been inferred before for other omomyids
   and adapiforms. The most unusual feature of T. belgica is its elongated
   middle phalanges (most likely manual phalanges), suggesting that this
   early primate had very long fingers similar to those of living tarsiers.

Abstract = {Theoretical advances in the study of social evolution have highlighted
   the importance of studying group formation in conjunction with
   population dynamics. To address this need, a number of demographically
   explicit models have been developed. We parameterize such a model to
   study the evolution of multimale associations in Verreaux's sifaka
   (Propithecus verreauxi), a diurnal lemur living in small
   multimale-multifemale groups. We use long-term demographic data from a
   population in western Madagascar to estimate the fitness prospects of
   different male behavioral strategies. Our results indicate that
   dispersing male sifaka, rather than searching for a breeding territory
   of their own (floating), do better joining an established group as a
   subordinate with limited reproductive opportunities, mainly because they
   may later ascend to the dominant position. By contrast, resident males
   should not accept potential immigrants because we could not find any
   measurable benefit of living in a multimale group for them. There is
   thus a conflict over group membership between resident and floater
   males, and we suggest that floaters at least occasionally win this
   conflict because they have more to gain from joining than residents
   stand to lose by sharing their territory.},

Abstract = {Primate teeth adapt to the physical properties of foods in a variety of
   ways including changes in occlusal morphology, enamel thickness, and
   overall size. We conducted a comparative study of extant primates to
   examine whether their teeth also adapt to foods through variation in the
   mechanical properties of the enamel. Nanoindentation techniques were
   used to map profiles of elastic modulus and hardness across tooth
   sections from the enamel-dentin junction to the outer enamel surface in
   a broad sample of primates including apes, Old World monkeys, New World
   monkeys, and lemurs. The measured data profiles feature considerable
   overlap among species, indicating a high degree of commonality in
   mechanical properties. These results suggest that differences in the
   load-bearing capacity of primate molar teeth are more a function of
   morphologyparticularly tooth size and enamel thicknessthan of underlying
   mechanical properties. Am J Phys Anthropol 148:171177, 2012. (c) 2012

Title = {LMTK1/AATYK1 Is a Novel Regulator of Axonal Outgrowth That Acts via
   Rab11 in a Cdk5-Dependent Manner},

Abstract = {Axonal outgrowth is a coordinated process of cytoskeletal dynamics and
   membrane trafficking; however, little is known about proteins
   responsible for regulating the membrane supply. LMTK1 (lemur kinase
   1)/AATYK1 (apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase 1) is a serine/threonine
   kinase that is highly expressed in neurons. We recently reported that
   LMTK1 plays a role in recycling endosomal trafficking in CHO-K1 cells.
   Here we explore the role of LMTK1 in axonal outgrowth and its regulation
   by Cdk5 using mouse brain cortical neurons. LMTK1 was expressed and was
   phosphorylated at Ser34, the Cdk5 phosphorylation site, at the time of
   axonal outgrowth in culture and colocalized with Rab11A, the small
   GTPase that regulates recycling endosome traffic, at the perinuclear
   region and in the axon. Overexpression of the unphosphorylated mutant
   LMTK1-S34A dramatically promoted axonal outgrowth in cultured neurons.
   Enhanced axonal outgrowth was diminished by the inactivation of Rab11A,
   placing LMTK1 upstream of Rab11A. Unexpectedly, the downregulation of
   LMTK1 by knockdown or gene targeting also significantly enhanced axonal
   elongation. Rab11A-positive vesicles were transported anterogradely more
   quickly in the axons of LMTK1-deficient neurons than in those of
   wild-type neurons. The enhanced axonal outgrowth was reversed by
   LMTK1-WT or the LMTK1-S34D mutant, which mimics the phosphorylated
   state, but not by LMTK1-S34A. Thus, LMTK1 can negatively control axonal

Abstract = {Mammals are unique in being the only group of amniotes that can hear
   sounds in the upper frequency range (>12 kHz), yet details about the
   evolutionary development of hearing patterns remain poorly understood.
   In this study, we used high resolution X-ray computed tomography to
   investigate several functionally relevant auditory structures of the
   inner ear in a sample of 21 fossil primate species (60 Ma to recent
   times) and 25 species of living euarchontans (primates, tree shrews, and
   flying lemurs). The structures examined include the length of the
   cochlea, development of bony spiral lamina and area of the oval window
   (or stapedial footplate when present). Using these measurements we
   predicted aspects of low-frequency and high-frequency sensitivity and
   show that hearing patterns in primates likely evolved in several stages
   through the first half of the Cenozoic. These results provide temporal
   boundaries for the development of hearing patterns in extant lineages
   and strongly suggest that the ancestral euarchontan hearing pattern was
   characterized by good high-frequency hearing but relatively poor
   low-frequency sensitivity. They also show that haplorhines are unique
   among primates (extant or extinct) in having relatively longer cochleae
   and increased low-frequency sensitivity. We combined these results with
   additional, older paleontological evidence to put these findings in a
   broader evolutionary context. Anat Rec, 295:615-631, 2012. (C)2012 Wiley

Volume = {147},

Abstract = {Dominance hierarchies are thought to provide various fitness-related
   benefits to dominant individuals (e.g., preferential access to food or
   mating partners). Remarkably, however, different studies on this topic
   have produced contradictory results, with some showing strong positive
   association between rank and fitness (i.e., dominants gain benefits over
   subordinates), others weak associations, and some others even revealing
   negative associations. Here, we investigate dominance-related benefits
   across primate species while controlling for phylogenetic effects. We
   extracted data from 94 published studies, representing 25 primate
   species (2 lemur species, 4 New World monkeys, 16 Old World monkeys, and
   3 apes), to assess how dominance affects life-history and behavior. We
   used standard and phylogenetic meta-analyses to analyze the benefits of
   dominance in primates. Dominant females had higher infant survival to
   first year, although we found no significant effect of dominance on
   female feeding success. Results for female fecundity differed between
   the two meta-analytical approaches, with no effect of dominance on
   female fecundity after controlling for phylogeny. Dominant males had a
   higher fecundity and mating success than subordinate males. Finally, the
   benefits of dominance for female fecundity were stronger in species with
   a longer lifespan. Our study supports the view that dominance
   hierarchies are a key aspect of primate societies as they indeed provide
   a number of fitness-related benefits to individuals. Am J Phys Anthropol

Abstract = {Interactions between kinases and the estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha)
   are thought to be a critical signaling pathway in the majority of human
   breast cancers. We have recently identified a previously uncharacterized
   molecule, lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3) as a prognostic and predictive
   oncogenic ER alpha regulator with a central role in endocrine
   resistance. Unusually this protein has undergone Darwinian positive
   selection between Chimpanzees and humans suggesting it may contribute to
   human susceptibility to ER alpha-positive tumors. Using over 600
   European primary breast cancer cases, we wished to establish tumor
   characteristics associated with both cytoplasmic and nuclear LMTK3
   expression, and then externally validate our observed European clinical
   outcomes with samples from Asian individuals receiving chemotherapy.
   Both nuclear and cytoplasmic expression correlated with tumor grade (P <
   0.001) and in the Asian cohort, independent blinded analyses
   demonstrated that high basal LMTK3 expression was associated with
   advanced stage of primary breast cancers as well as decreased overall (P
   = 0.03) and disease-free survival (P = 0.006). In summary, higher LMTK3
   expression is associated with more aggressive cancers. These data
   support our previous findings and suggest LMTK3 expression may be a
   reliable new biomarker in breast cancer.},

Abstract = {Membrane-bound IgE (mIgE) on B lymphocytes is essential for IgE
   production. Earlier studies showed that the epsilon chain of mIgE (m
   epsilon) on human B cells has a ``long{''} isoform, with an extra ``C
   epsilon mX{''} domain of 52 amino acid (aa) residues between the CH4
   domain and the membrane-anchor segment, as compared to the conventional
   ``short{''} isoform. Because C epsilon mX provides an antigenic site for
   targeting IgE-expressing B cells to down-regulate IgE production in
   patients with allergy, analysis of C epsilon mX in various animals is of
   great interest. Hence, we analyzed the epsilon Ig gene, in particular,
   its membrane exon regions encoding the membrane anchor peptide segment
   and C epsilon mX domain, of 26 species of the order Primates and 12
   species of seven non-Primate orders using data obtained experimentally
   or retrieved from GenBank. Our analyses reveal the unexpected finding
   that the genes of three extant tarsier species do not contain the
   membrane exons for mIgE. Another striking finding is that early evolved
   Strepsirhini primates such as lemurs and lorises do not have gene
   segments for the long isoform, whereas New World monkeys such as
   marmosets and squirrel monkeys allow the transcription of only the long
   isoform. In Old World monkeys and apes, including humans, the epsilon
   gene allows the transcription of both isoforms. This work thus reveals
   the dramatic differences in the gene segment encoding the m epsilon C
   terminal region among the four major primate lineages: the Strepsirhini
   primates, the tarsiers, New World monkeys, and Old World monkeys and
   apes/humans.},

Title = {Effects of Chronic Calorie Restriction or Dietary Resveratrol
   Supplementation on Insulin Sensitivity Markers in a Primate, Microcebus
   murinus},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {The prevalence of diabetes and hyperinsulinemia increases with age,
   inducing metabolic failure and limiting lifespan. Calorie restriction
   (CR) without malnutrition delays the aging process, but its long-term
   application to humans seems difficult. Resveratrol (RSV), a dietary
   polyphenol, appears to be a promising CR mimetic that can be easily
   administered in humans. In this work, we hypothesized that both CR and
   RSV impact insulin sensitivity in a non-human primate compared to
   standard-fed control (CTL) animals. Four-to five-year-old male grey
   mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) were assigned to three dietary groups:
   a CTL group, a CR group receiving 30\% fewer calories than the CTL and a
   RSV group receiving the CTL diet supplemented with RSV (200
   mg.day(-1).kg(-1)). Insulin sensitivity and glycemia were assessed using
   an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the homeostasis model
   assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR index) evaluation after 21 or
   33 months of chronic treatment. Resting metabolic rate was also measured
   to assess the potential relationships between this energy expenditure
   parameter and insulin sensitivity markers. No differences were found
   after a 21-month period of treatment, except for lower glucose levels 30
   min after glucose loading in CR animals. After 33 months, CR and RSV
   decreased glycemia after the oral glucose loading without decreasing
   fasting blood insulin. A general effect of treatment was observed on the
   HOMA-IR index, with an 81\% reduction in CR animals and 53\% in RSV
   animals after 33 months of treatment compared to CTL. Chronic CR and
   dietary supplementation with RSV affected insulin sensitivity by
   improving the glucose tolerance of animals without disturbing their
   baseline insulin secretion. These results suggest that both CR and RSV
   have beneficial effects on metabolic alterations, although these effects
   are different in amplitude between the two anti-aging treatments and
   potentially rely on different metabolic changes.},

Abstract = {The diversity of aging models Most of the signalling pathways involved
   in aging regulation have been recently found well conserved at various
   levels throughout the evolution. Taking this into account, a diversity
   of model organisms, including worms, rodents, and lemurs as well, allows
   to address different questions: how to understand the interactions
   between genetic and environmental factors while challenging theories of
   aging, to preserve hearing integrity, to fight against senescence of
   neural stem cells, or to explore brain fitness from gene expression to
   cognitive and social behavior? Here are the main issues that can be
   considered, stressing the complementarities of the models. The
   differentiation of aging physiological aspects from those induced by
   age-related pathologies will also be specified. By emphasizing recent
   ability of technologies to promote new aging insights, we discuss
   towards a better understanding of mechanisms governing aging.},

Title = {Testing Bergmann's rule and the resource seasonality hypothesis in

Volume = {147},

Abstract = {We tested four major hypotheses on the ecological aspects of body mass
   variation in extant Malagasy strepsirrhines: thermoregulation, resource
   seasonality/scarcity, resource quality, and primary productivity. These
   biogeographic hypotheses focus on the ecological aspects of body mass
   variation, largely ignoring the role of phylogeny for explaining body
   mass variation within lineages. We tested the independent effects of
   climate and resource-related variables on variation in body mass among
   Malagasy primates using recently developed comparative methods that
   account for phylogenetic history and spatial autocorrelation. We
   extracted data on lemur body mass and climate variables for a total of
   43 species from 39 sites. Climatic data were obtained from the WorldClim
   database, which is based on climate data from weather stations compiled
   around the world. Using generalized linear models that incorporate
   parameters to account for phylogenetic and spatial autocorrelation, we
   found that diet and climate variables were weak predictors of lemur body
   mass. Moreover, there was a strong phylogenetic effect relative to the
   effects of space on lemur body mass in all models. Thus, we failed to
   find support for any of the four hypotheses on patterns of geography and
   body mass in extant strepsirrhines. Our results indicate that body mass
   has been conserved since early in the evolutionary history of each
   genus, while species diversified into different environmental niches.
   Our findings are in contrast to some previous studies that have
   suggested resource and climate related effects on body mass, though
   these studies have examined this question at different taxonomic and/or
   geographic scales. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Tetrapods with highly different morphologies occupy ecological niches of
   the canopy making them ideal for testing the evolution of structures and
   performances under similar environmental selective pressures. We
   compared leap up strategies between two distantly related amniote
   species, Anolis carolinensis (Squamate) and Microcebus murinus
   (Lemuriform) known to use leaping as their major locomotor mode for
   predator avoidance. Our comparative analysis and model show that leaping
   strategies (flat jump trajectory in horizontal leaps, use of forelimbs
   in landing) are similar in both species. The most striking divergence
   concerns only the temporal joint sequence accommodation to leaping
   height, although an identical proximal-to-distal sequence is observed
   when both taxa leap to maximal height. We suggest a convergent
   exaptation of leaping biomechanics among arboreal amniotes, which
   reflects similar biomechanical constraints and evolutionary pressures in
   these animals.},

Year = {2012},
Pages = {265-310},
Abstract = {Global inventories of biodiversity indicate that more than 100,000
   different animal species - and perhaps as many as 200,000 - play roles
   in pollinating the 250,000 kinds of wild flowering plants on this
   planet. Only 15\% of these crops are serviced by domestic honey bees,
   while at least 80\% are pollinated by wild bees and other wildlife. In
   addition to countless bees, number of non bee pollinators such as wasps,
   moths, butterflies, flies, beetles and other invertebrates, perhaps
   1,500 species of vertebrates such as birds, bats and non-flying mammals
   (several species of monkey, marsupials, primates, rodents, lemur, tree
   squirrels) have long been reported to visit flowers and serve as
   effective pollinators. Birds represent a group of animals that have
   evolved in parallel with flowering plants along lines of pollination
   syndromes. Hummingbirds are the best-known wildlife pollinators, but
   perching birds, flying foxes, fruit bats, possums, lemurs and even a
   gecko function as effective pollinators. Mammals are not generally known
   for their pollinating activities, but one group stands out as an
   exception - the nectar feeding bats. There are also examples of
   marsupial mammals serving as pollinators, as shown by the ``honey
   possum{''} of Australia, and there have even been reports of pollination
   being effected by rodent species. Globally, over 100 species of birds
   and mammals in 60 genera of vertebrate pollinators are already listed as
   endangered and untold numbers of invertebrates are at risk as well. Much
   more research is still required to understand the importance of these
   animals in pollination.},

Title = {CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF INDIA, 1851-1890, TO THE
   CONCEPT OF GONDWANA-LAND},
Journal = {EARTH SCIENCES HISTORY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {247-269},
Abstract = {In 1864, Sclater proposed a Tertiary continent connecting Africa,
   Madagascar, and the Mascarene Islands, off of the southwest coast of
   India, to explain the distribution of small mammals. His `Lemuria' was
   superseded among biogeographers by Wallace's land bridges in 1876. The
   notion of an ancient continent of Gondwana-Land had a different
   intellectual lineage. It grew as a paleogeographical idea from the
   fieldwork and paleontological studies of the Geological Survey of India
   (GSI) in the 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s and proved to be durable, albeit
   with different configurations, over the last century and a half.
   Initially, the Gondwana rocks were termed Raniganj Series, Talchir
   Series, and so on, after the great coalfields in India, but in the 1870s
   they were consolidated into the Gondwana Series and then Gondwana
   System. At the same time, the GSI scientists posited a continent of
   Gondwana age rocks stretching from Africa across India and on to
   Australia. In 1885, Suess proposed a more limited Gondwanan-aged
   Indo-African continent, mostly similar to Sclater's Lemuria, which he
   named Gondwana-Land. Suess's construct also included a tectonic
   component that the GSI's landmass did not. But it was not the vast
   continent in terms of its size that the GSI people had envisioned,
   which, in time, Suess would also acknowledge. In 1890, William Blanford,
   a central figure in the GSI part of the Gondwana story, reviewed and
   expanded the concept of the continent to South America, based on
   Neumayr's 1887 work, and suggested an Antarctica involvement. Curiously,
   however, some historians and geologists have overlooked the work that
   preceded Suess and have credited Suess with the entire idea.},

Abstract = {Accurately and effectively measuring the similarity between terms is one
   way to enhance the performance of information retrieval systems. At
   present, the extended data source which is used for Mongolian semantic
   query expansion is still not perfect. A new query expansion method based
   on Mongolian semantics is proposed for expressing the user's intention
   more precisely. This query expansion method includes two steps. The
   first step is to build an associateddictionary by associated term
   rearrangement algorithm. The second step is to expand the original query
   by the associated-dictionary. The core of the method adopted in this
   paper is associated term rearrangement algorithm and re-weight expansion
   terms algorithm. Experiments with Lemur tools show that the retrieval
   results have been greatly improved by this method.},

Title = {Growth and the development of sexual size dimorphism in lorises and

Abstract = {Three fundamental ontogenetic pathways lead to the development of size
   differences between males and females. Males and females may grow at the
   same rate for different durations (bimaturism), grow for the same
   duration at different rates, or grow at a mix of rate and duration
   differences. While patterns of growth and the development of adult body
   size are well established for many haplorhines, the extent to which rate
   and duration differences affect strepsirrhine growth trajectories
   remains unclear. Here, we present iterative piecewise regression models
   that describe the ontogeny of adult body mass for males and females of
   five lorisoid species (i.e., lorises and galagos) from the Duke Lemur
   Center. We test the hypotheses that, like most haplorhines, sexual size
   dimorphism (SSD) is a result of bimaturism, and males and females of
   monomorphic species grow at the same rate for a similar duration. We
   confirm that the galagos in this sample (Galago moholi and Otolemur
   garnettii) show significant SSD that is achieved through bimaturism.
   Unlike monomorphic lemurids, the lorises in this sample show a diversity
   of ontogenetic patterns. Loris tardigradus does follow a lemur-like
   trajectory to monomorphism but Nycticebus coucang and Nycticebus
   pygmaeus achieve larger adult female body sizes through a mixture of
   rate and duration differences. We show that contrary to previous
   assumptions, there are patterns of both similarity and difference in
   growth trajectories of comparably sized lorises and galagos.
   Furthermore, when ontogenetic profiles of lorisoid and lemurid growth
   are compared, it is evident that lorisoids grow faster for a shorter
   period of time. Am J Phys Anthropol 147: 11-20, 2012. (C) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {To grip rocks on the surfaces of asteroids and comets, and to grip the
   cliff faces and lava tubes of Mars, a 250 mm diameter omni-directional
   anchor is presented that utilizes a hierarchical array of claws with
   suspension flexures, called microspines, to create fast, strong
   attachment. Prototypes have been demonstrated on vesicular basalt and
   a'a lava rock supporting forces in all directions away from the rock.
   Each anchor can support >160 N tangent, >150 N at 45 degrees, and >180 N
   normal to the surface of the rock. A two-actuator selectively-compliant
   ankle interfaces these anchors to the Lemur IIB robot for climbing
   trials. A rotary percussive drill was also integrated into the anchor,
   demonstrating self-contained rock coring regardless of gravitational
   orientation. As a harder-than-zero-g proof of concept, 20mm diameter
   boreholes were drilled 83 mm deep in vesicular basalt samples, retaining
   a 12 mm diameter rock core in 3-6 pieces while in an inverted
   configuration, literally drilling into the ceiling.},

Abstract = {New field sampling of classic Ibexian sections in the Great Basin has
   resulted in the discovery of several new species assignable to the
   pliomerid trilobite genus Protopliomerella Harrington, 1957. The genus
   was originally monotypic and based on Protopliomerops contracta Ross,
   1951. Protopliomerella pauca Demeter, 1973, was later added, but it is
   shown herein to be a junior subjective synonym of P. contracta. The
   material originally assigned to Protopliomerella contracta by Ross
   belongs to as many as three distinct, stratigraphically separate
   species. New species include P. stegneri, P. bowlesi, P. kerouaci, P.
   seegeri, and P. okeeffeae. Two additional new species are not well
   enough known to name and are reported in open nomenclature. The
   phylogenetic status of Protopliomerella, as thus conceived, is ambiguous
   and the taxon may be rendered paraphyletic by the genera Pseudocybele

Abstract = {Previous studies have examined tooth eruption as it relates
   intrinsically to body mass, brain mass, and other life history
   variables, and extrinsically to ecological factors (e.g., age at
   foraging independence, environmental risk aversion, and maternal
   investment). Different models have been explored wherein each of these
   variables impacts ontogeny. However, anthropoid and strepsirhine
   primates exhibit interesting differences in the relationships of these
   ecological and life history variables with tooth eruption. Moreover,
   interactions between ecological variables and dental tissue growth have
   only been explored in the lemurs. This study examines dental
   microstructure of the New World monkey family, Cebidae, to provide
   further insight into forces influencing the evolution of primate dental
   ontogeny. The Cebidae were chosen because they are a diverse group which
   is distinct in ecology and phylogeny from the better known catarrhines
   of the Old World. Using phylogenetic generalized least squares analyses
   (PGLS), we test whether brain mass, body mass, or the three
   above-mentioned ecological variables have stronger correlations with
   enamel growth. Results show that ecological factors have stronger
   relationships with cebid dental growth rates than brain or body mass.
   Foraging independence has the most impact on overall enamel growth as it
   has the strongest correlation with enamel extension rates. However,
   another estimate of enamel growth, rate of secretion, has the highest
   correlation with maternal investment. Our results suggest that an
   overarching ecological model encompassing the three current ecological
   hypotheses is needed to further understand the evolution of dental
   ontogeny within primates. Anat Rec,, 2011. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {A re-examination of primate foot and knee anatomy suggests that
   strepsirrhine primates (adapiforms and lemuriforms) possess a unique and
   derived hindlimb related to their use of vertical supports. In contrast,
   leaping adaptations are older and shared by both major euprimate clades,
   Strepsirrhini and Haplorhini. Combining this derived hindlimb anatomy
   with leaping suggests that ancestral strepsirrhines were at least
   frequent vertical support users and leapers, and perhaps vertical
   clingers and leapers. These initial strepsirrhine adaptations were
   preadaptive for later lemuriform vertical clingers and leapers. In
   contrast, haplorhine vertical clingers and leapers require additional
   foot and leg modifications to accommodate a vertical clinging and
   leaping lifestyle. The movement pattern called vertical clinging and
   leaping evolved independently among different primate lineages
   throughout primate evolutionary history for several different ecological
   reasons. Am J Phys Anthropol 146:323-335, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss,

Title = {Giardia duodenalis assemblages and Entamoeba species infecting non-human
   primates in an Italian zoological garden: zoonotic potential and
   management traits},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Background: Giardia duodenalis and Entamoeba spp. are among the most
   common intestinal human protozoan parasites worldwide and they are
   frequently reported in captive non-human primates (NHP). From a public
   health point of view, infected animals in zoos constitute a risk for
   animal caretakers and visitors. In this study we carried out the
   molecular identification of G. duodenalis and Entamoeba spp. from nine
   species of primates housed in the zoological garden of Rome, to better
   ascertain their occurrence and zoonotic potential.
   Results: G. duodenalis was found only in Lemur catta (47.0\%). Entamoeba
   spp. were detected in all species studied, with the exception of Eulemur
   macaco and Varecia rubra. The number of positive pools ranged from 5.9\%
   in L. catta to 81.2\% in Mandrillus sphinx; in Pan troglodytes the
   observed prevalence was 53.6\%. A mixed Entamoeba-Giardia infection was
   recorded only in one sample of L. catta. All G. duodenalis isolates
   belonged to the zoonotic assemblage B, sub assemblage BIV. Three
   Entamoeba species were identified: E. hartmanni, E. coli and E. dispar.
   Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of regularly testing
   animals kept in zoos for the diagnosis of zoonotic parasites, in order
   to evaluate their pathogenic role in the housed animals and the zoonotic
   risk linked to their presence. A quick detection of the arrival of
   pathogens into the enclosures could also be a prerequisite to limit
   their spread into the structure via the introduction of specific control
   strategies. The need for molecular identification of some parasite
   species/genotype in order to better define the zoonotic risk is also
   highlighted.},

Title = {Talar morphology of azibiids, strepsirhine-related primates from the
   Eocene of Algeria: Phylogenetic affinities and locomotor adaptation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {61},
Number = {4},
Pages = {447-457},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The HGL-50 locality, situated on the Glib Zegdou outlier in the Gour
   Lazib of Algeria (Hammada du Dra), is famous for having yielded several
   dental remains of primates dating from the late Early to the early
   Middle Eocene. These primates include Algeripithecus minutus, Azibius
   trerki and a new species of cf. Azibius (not described yet).
   Algeripithecus was widely acknowledged to be one of the oldest known
   anthropoids from Africa. However, very recent discoveries strongly
   suggest that Algeripithecus is closely related to Azibius and that both
   taxa are phylogenetically remote from the clade Anthropoidea.
   Algeripithecus and Azibius make up the family Azibiidae and appear as
   stem strepsirhines. Here we describe and analyse two ankle bones (tali)
   found in HGL-50. UM/HGL50-466 is a small left talus, which is
   appropriate in size to belong to A. trerki, while UM/HGL50-467 is a
   right talus, which is significantly larger and appropriate in size to
   belong to the new large species of cf. Azibius. Both tali exhibit a
   suite of features that resemble conditions primarily found in extinct
   and extant strepsirhine and adapiform primates; conditions that are
   consistent with the strepsirhine-like dentition characterizing azibiids.
   Functionally, these two tali indicate that Azibius species were engaged
   in a form of active arboreal quadrupedalism with some ability to climb
   and leap. Azibiids were rather small-bodied primates, approximating the
   size of some modern dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleidae) and sportive lemurs
   (Lepi-lemuridae) from Madagascar. Given their small body-size and their
   talar morphology, living cheirogaleid lemurs, which are agile arboreal
   quadrupeds (with climbing, springing and branch running activities),
   might appear as good analogues for azibiids in terms of locomotor
   behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Giardia is the most common enteric protozoan that can be pathogenic to
   both humans and animals. Transmission can be direct through the
   faecal-oral route, or through ingestion of contaminated water or food.
   Genetic characterization of Giardia duodenalis isolates has demonstrated
   the existence of seven groups (assemblages A to G) which differ in their
   host distribution. Assemblages A and B are present in humans and other
   primates, dogs, cats, rodents, and other species of wild mammals, but
   the role of the different host animals in the epidemiology of human
   infection remains unclear. With this preliminary data, we can infer that
   nonhuman primates (NHP) might be a potential reservoir for zoonotic
   transmission. This research paper discusses the presence of Giardia in
   nonhuman primates housed in two Spanish zoological gardens (located in
   Valencia and Madrid). Twenty faecal samples obtained from 16 different
   species of NHP were studied; 70\% were positives to Giardia, and genetic
   analyses were performed by sequencing of four genes (SSrRNA, glutamate
   dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, and beta-giardin). The
   assemblage A was the most frequent (63.4\%) in the species studied. A
   sequence from a red ruffed lemur (corresponding to genotype AI) was
   obtained, and this is the first reported sequence of a gdh gene obtained
   from this species. The multi-locus sequence analysis was also performed
   on the samples positive to nested PCR belonging to assemblage B. After
   amplification using the GDHeF, GDHiF, and GDHiR gdh primers; AL3543,
   AL3546, AL3544, and AL3545 tpi primers; G7, G759, GBF, and GBR bg
   primers, amplicons of 432, 500, and 511 bp respectively were obtained.
   Amplification products were sequenced and the sequence and phylogenetic
   analyses showed that genotype IV like was the most frequent in the
   samples belonging to this assemblage.},

Abstract = {Sardinella tawilis (Herre, 1927), the only freshwater sardine in the
   world, is endemic to Taal Lake, Philippines. It is a major fishery
   resource in the area. In this study, DNA barcoding using cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was performed on Sardine Ila tawilis and
   its marine relatives S. fimbriata, S. jussieu, S. lemuru and Nematalosa
   nasus. Additional sequences from S. albella, S. atricauda, S. gibbosa S.
   jussieu, S. lemuru, S. longiceps and S. melanura were obtained from
   GenBank. A total of 54 sequences were analyzed. The Kimura 2-parameter
   (K2P) distance model was used to compute the divergences of sequences
   within and between species and to generate a Neighbour-joining (NJ)
   tree. The mean intraspecific genetic distance was 0.3\%, whereas the
   mean interspecific genetic distance was 15.2\%. The genetic distance of
   S. tawilis from other Sardine Ila species ranged from 16.4\% to 19.3\%.
   S. tawilis also formed a distinct cluster in the NJ tree that is
   well-separated from the other species. These findings contrast with the
   suggestion in previous studies that S. tawilis and S. albella are
   ecomorphs of the same species and are not truly differentiated species
   based on mitochondrial control region sequence and multivariate analysis
   of morphological characters. This study is the first to report the
   occurrence of S. jussieu in the Philippines. Out of the five S. jussieu
   COI sequences generated in this study, two clustered with S. fimbriata,
   while the other three clustered with S. jussieu sequences from GenBank.
   Although S. fimbriata and S. jussieu are morphologically distinct based
   on gill raker counts, the clustering of two specimens of S. jussieu with
   S. fimbriata could be due to introgressive hybridization. COI sequences
   of S. atricauda and S. melanura from GenBank are identical.
   Interspecific genetic distances between some pairs of marine Sardine Ila
   are very low (0-1.6\%). Further taxonomic studies using other
   mitochondrial and nuclear regions should be done to differentiate one
   species from the other and to establish their evolutionary},

Abstract = {A hip implant re-operation is usually related to the service life of the
   component, as determined by its material properties, or a loosening of
   the hip implant resulting from a poor alignment with adjacent bone
   tissues. These issues invariably arise from the use of standardized
   products even though each patient differs in terms of anatomical
   parameters of their hips. To deal with such challenges, customized hip
   implants are needed that are designed to optimize the alignment with the
   hip according to the anatomical differences of individual patients.
   Therefore, this study presents an optimal joint restoration system
   optimized to the needs of the individual user as regards developing
   treatment technology to restore the function of an aged joint. A hip
   implant usually consists of a body and neck, thus, among 15 anatomical
   basic parameters of the human lemur, 8 are selected as hip implant
   design input parameters to focus on the most critical elements for a hip
   implant in the case of a total hip replacement. In addition, specific
   design input parameters are proposed including a wiring hole and distal
   slotted part, and analyzed using a finite element analysis method. The
   anatomical parameters in relation to a variation of the neck length are
   also analyzed in the same manner. To confirm the design parameters
   enabling normal hip implantation, a maximum neck shaft angle and length
   threshold model is implemented on the basis of the statistical average
   femoral configuration of Koreans and verified by a FEM (Finite Element
   Method) fatigue analysis. An analysis protocol aligned with
   international specifications as applied and a threshold for each of the
   aforementioned parameters set up to derive optimal design parameters.
   Finally, as a pre-operation planning tool, the parameters of choice are
   extracted from an X-ray femur image and reconstructed into a 2D/3D CAD
   model using a customized hip implant design software program, and the
   model stability is verified using a static FEM.},

Title = {Distribution of Olfactory and Nonolfactory Surface Area in the Nasal

Abstract = {The nasal fossa of most mammals exemplifies extreme skeletal complexity.
   Thin scrolls of bone (turbinals) that both elaborate surface area (SA)
   and subdivide nasal space are used as morphological proxies for
   olfactory and respiratory physiology. The present study offers
   additional details on the nasal fossa of the adult mouse lemur
   (Microcebus murinus), previously described by Smith and Rossie (Smith
   and Rossie {[}2008]; Anatomical Record 291:895-915). Additional,
   intervening histological sections of the specimen were used to map and
   quantify the distribution of olfactory and nonolfactory mucosa on the
   smaller turbinal of the frontal recess (FR; frontoturbinal) and those
   that occur between ethmoturbinals (ETs; interturbinals). A second adult
   Microcebus specimen, available as a dried skull, was scanned using
   microcomputed tomography (microCT) and reconstructed to infer the
   position of these turbinals within the nasal airway. Overall, turbinal
   bones comprise more than half of internal nasal SA. All ETs combined
   comprise about 30\% of total nasal fossa SA, and contribute nearly half
   of all olfactory SA. Of these, the nasoturbinal (NT) is most completely
   covered with olfactory mucosa, whereas ET I is least covered with
   olfactory mucosa. The FR contributes significantly to total olfactory SA
   (ca. 20\%). This recess and the single frontoturbinal within it lie in a
   more lateral pathway of airflow compared with interturbinals, which lie
   in more central zone just anterior to the olfactory recess of
   Microcebus. Variations in the turbinals and recesses that complicate
   central and paranasal in primates should be investigated further in
   light of zone-specific distributions of olfactory receptors (ORs) that
   differ between these regions in rodents. Anat Rec, 294:1217-1225, 2011

Title = {Omega-3 Fatty Acids from Fish Oil Lower Anxiety, Improve Cognitive

   Primate},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},

Abstract = {Omega-3 (omega 3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are major
   components of brain cells membranes. omega 3 PUFA-deficient rodents
   exhibit severe cognitive impairments (learning, memory) that have been
   linked to alteration of brain glucose utilization or to changes in
   neurotransmission processes. omega 3 PUFA supplementation has been shown
   to lower anxiety and to improve several cognitive parameters in rodents,
   while very few data are available in primates. In humans, little is
   known about the association between anxiety and omega 3 fatty acids
   supplementation and data are divergent about their impact on cognitive
   functions. Therefore, the development of nutritional studies in
   non-human primates is needed to disclose whether a long-term
   supplementation with long-chain omega 3 PUFA has an impact on
   behavioural and cognitive parameters, differently or not from rodents.
   We address the hypothesis that omega 3 PUFA supplementation could lower
   anxiety and improve cognitive performances of the Grey Mouse Lemur
   (Microcebus murinus), a nocturnal Malagasy prosimian primate. Adult male
   mouse lemurs were fed for 5 months on a control diet or on a diet
   supplemented with long-chain omega 3 PUFA (n = 6 per group).
   Behavioural, cognitive and motor performances were measured using an
   open field test to evaluate anxiety, a circular platform test to
   evaluate reference spatial memory, a spontaneous locomotor activity
   monitoring and a sensory-motor test. omega 3-supplemented animals
   exhibited lower anxiety level compared to control animals, what was
   accompanied by better performances in a reference spatial memory task
   (80\% of successful trials vs 35\% in controls, p < 0.05), while the
   spontaneous locomotor activity was reduced by 31\% in omega
   3-supplemented animals (p < 0.001), a parameter that can be linked with
   lowered anxiety. The long-term dietary omega 3 PUFA supplementation
   positively impacts on anxiety and cognitive performances in the adult
   mouse lemur. The supplementation of human food with omega 3 fatty acids
   may represent a valuable dietary strategy to improve behavioural and
   cognitive functions.},

Abstract = {Therapies targeting estrogen receptor. (ER alpha, encoded by ESR1) have
   transformed the treatment of breast cancer. However, large numbers of
   women relapse, highlighting the need for the discovery of new regulatory
   targets modulating ER alpha pathways(1-5). An siRNA screen identified
   kinases whose silencing alters the estrogen response including those
   previously implicated in regulating ER alpha activity (such as
   mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT). Among the most potent
   regulators was lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3), for which a role has not
   previously been assigned. In contrast to other modulators of ER alpha
   activity, LMTK3 seems to have been subject to Darwinian positive
   selection, a noteworthy result given the unique susceptibility of humans
   to ER alpha(+) breast cancer. LMTK3 acts by decreasing the activity of
   protein kinase C (PKC) and the phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473), thereby
   increasing binding of forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) to the ESR1 promoter.
   LMTK3 phosphorylated ER alpha, protecting it from proteasomal
   degradation in vitro. Silencing of LMTK3 reduced tumor volume in an
   orthotopic mouse model and abrogated proliferation of ER alpha(+) but
   not ER alpha(-) cells, indicative of its role in ER alpha activity. In
   human cancers, LMTK3 abundance and intronic polymorphisms were
   significantly associated with disease-free and overall survival and
   predicted response to endocrine therapies. These findings yield insights
   into the natural history of breast cancer in humans and reveal LMTK3 as
   a new therapeutic target.},

Abstract = {Resveratrol (RSV) is a dietary polyphenolic compound with several
   positive effects on metabolic functions and longevity. We tested the
   effect of RSV on the circadian clock in a nonhuman primate, the gray
   mouse lemur. The impact of a 2-week dietary supplementation of RSV on
   the rhythms of locomotor activity and body temperature in constant dark
   conditions (DD) was investigated in young (n = 7) and old (n = 6)
   animals. RSV supplementation followed 2 weeks in DD under normal diet
   (CTL). In both young and old animals receiving RSV, we observed a
   shortening of the free-running period compared to those under CTL (-15
   minutes in young animals and -45 minutes in old animals), accompanied by
   a lower mean body temperature in both age groups and decreased locomotor
   activity in young animals. Thus, RSV is a food component capable of
   influencing a primate's circadian clock. This property may be of
   interest clinically in the context of the treatment of circadian
   disruption and in the context of the effects of RSV ingestion on health.},

Title = {The evolutionary history of the SAL1 gene family in eutherian mammals},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {Background: SAL1 (salivary lipocalin) is a member of the OBP (Odorant
   Binding Protein) family and is involved in chemical sexual communication
   in pig. SAL1 and its relatives may be involved in pheromone and
   olfactory receptor binding and in pre-mating behaviour. The evolutionary
   history and the selective pressures acting on SAL1 and its orthologous
   genes have not yet been exhaustively described. The aim of the present
   work was to study the evolution of these genes, to elucidate the role of
   selective pressures in their evolution and the consequences for their
   functions.
   Results: Here, we present the evolutionary history of SAL1 gene and its
   orthologous genes in mammals. We found that (1) SAL1 and its related
   genes arose in eutherian mammals with lineage-specific duplications in
   rodents, horse and cow and are lost in human, mouse lemur, bushbaby and
   orangutan, (2) the evolution of duplicated genes of horse, rat, mouse
   and guinea pig is driven by concerted evolution with extensive gene
   conversion events in mouse and guinea pig and by positive selection
   mainly acting on paralogous genes in horse and guinea pig, (3) positive
   selection was detected for amino acids involved in pheromone binding and
   amino acids putatively involved in olfactory receptor binding, (4)
   positive selection was also found for lineage, indicating a
   species-specific strategy for amino acid selection.
   Conclusions: This work provides new insights into the evolutionary
   history of SAL1 and its orthologs. On one hand, some genes are subject
   to concerted evolution and to an increase in dosage, suggesting the need
   for homogeneity of sequence and function in certain species. On the
   other hand, positive selection plays a role in the diversification of
   the functions of the family and in lineage, suggesting adaptive
   evolution, with possible consequences for speciation and for the
   reinforcement of prezygotic barriers.},

Abstract = {Lentiviruses, the genus of retrovirus that includes HIV-1, rarely
   endogenize. Some lemurs uniquely possess an endogenous lentivirus called
   PSIV ({''}prosimian immunodeficiency virus{''}). Thus, lemurs provide
   the opportunity to study the activity of host defense factors, such as
   TRIM5 alpha, in the setting of germ line invasion. We characterized the
   activities of TRIM5 alpha proteins from two distant lemurs against
   exogenous retroviruses and a chimeric PSIV. TRIM5 alpha from gray mouse
   lemur, which carries PSIV in its genome, exhibited the narrowest
   restriction activity. One allelic variant of gray mouse lemur TRIM5
   alpha restricted only N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV), while a
   second variant restricted N-MLV and, uniquely, B-tropic MLV (B-MLV);
   both variants poorly blocked PSIV. In contrast, TRIM5 alpha from
   ring-tailed lemur, which does not contain PSIV in its genome, revealed
   one of the broadest antiviral activities reported to date against
   lentiviruses, including PSIV. Investigation into the antiviral
   specificity of ring-tailed lemur TRIM5 alpha demonstrated a major
   contribution of a 32-amino-acid expansion in variable region 2 (v2) of
   the B30.2/SPRY domain to the breadth of restriction. Data on lemur TRIM5
   alpha and the prediction of ancestral simian sequences hint at an
   evolutionary scenario where antiretroviral specificity is prominently
   defined by the lineage-specific expansion of the variable loops of
   B30.2/SPRY.},

Title = {When play is a family business: adult play, hierarchy, and possible
   stress reduction in common marmosets},
Journal = {PRIMATES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2},
Pages = {101-104},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Easy to recognize but not easy to define, animal play is a baffling
   behavior because it has no obvious immediate benefits for the
   performers. However, the absence of immediate advantages, if true, would
   leave adult play (costly but maintained by evolution, spanning lemurs to
   Homo sapiens) unexplained. Although a commonly held view maintains that
   play is limited by stress, an emergent hypothesis states that play can
   regulate stress in the short term. Here we explored this hypothesis in a
   captive family group of New World monkeys, Callithrix jacchus (common
   marmoset). We observed six subjects and gathered data on aggressive,
   play, and scratching behavior via focal (6 h/individual) and all
   occurrences sampling (115 h). We found that play levels were highest
   during pre-feeding, the period of maximum anxiety due to the forthcoming
   competition over food. Scratching (the most reliable indicator of stress
   in primates) and play showed opposite trends along hierarchy, with
   dominants scratching more and playing less than subordinates. Finally,
   scratching decreased after play, whereas play appeared to be unrelated
   to previous scratching events, symptoms of a potential stressful state.
   In conclusion, both play timing and hierarchical distribution indicate
   that play limits stress, more than vice versa, at least in the short
   term.},

Title = {Does body posture influence hand preference in an ancestral primate
   model?},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Background: The origin of human handedness and its evolution in primates
   is presently under debate. Current hypotheses suggest that body posture
   (postural origin hypothesis and bipedalism hypothesis) have an important
   impact on the evolution of handedness in primates. To gain insight into
   the origin of manual lateralization in primates, we studied gray mouse
   lemurs, suggested to represent the most ancestral primate condition.
   First, we investigated hand preference in a simple food grasping task to
   explore the importance of hand usage in a natural foraging situation.
   Second, we explored the influence of body posture by applying a forced
   food grasping task with varying postural demands (sit, biped, cling,
   triped).
   Results: The tested mouse lemur population did not prefer to use their
   hands alone to grasp for food items. Instead, they preferred to pick
   them up using a mouth-hand combination or the mouth alone. If mouth
   usage was inhibited, they showed an individual but no population level
   handedness for all four postural forced food grasping tasks.
   Additionally, we found no influence of body posture on hand preference
   in gray mouse lemurs.
   Conclusion: Our results do not support the current theories of primate
   handedness. Rather, they propose that ecological adaptation indicated by
   postural habit and body size of a given species has an important impact
   on hand preference in primates. Our findings suggest that small-bodied,
   quadrupedal primates, adapted to the fine branch niche of dense forests,
   prefer mouth retrieval of food and are less manually lateralized than
   large-bodied species which consume food in a more upright, and less
   stable body posture.},

Journal = {INVERTEBRATE SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {22-59},
Abstract = {We used morphological characters to explore the phylogeny of
   mammal-associated psoroptidian mites. In both maximum parsimony and
   Bayesian analyses, the clades uniting Psoroptoidea and
   Analgoidea-Sarcoptoidea (higher Psoroptidia) were strongly supported,
   and monophyly of most sarcoptoid families was confirmed. However, the
   relationships among families of the higher Psoroptidia (Analgoidea and
   Sarcoptoidea) remained poorly resolved. Two most parsimonious trees were
   obtained after successive weighting. In these trees, higher Psoroptidia
   split into two main clusters with Sarcoptoidea in the traditional sense
   shown as diphyletic. Cluster I consists of two superfamilies:
   Analgoidea, including Dermationidae, and Psoroptoidea, stat. res.:
   Psoroptoidinae (Turbinoptidae-Paracoroptinae); (Pandalurinae
   (Pyroglyphidae-Lobalgidae); Paralgopsidae, stat. nov.-Ptyssalgidae
   (Epidermoptidae-Psoroptidae). Cluster II consists of the superfamily
   Sarcoptoidea represented by two lineages: Listropsoralgidae, stat. nov.
   (Myocoptidae (Rhyncoptidae-Sarcoptidae)) and Dromiciocoptidae, stat.
   nov. ((Listrophoridae-Atopomelidae) (Chirodiscidae (Gastronyssidae
   (Pneumocoptidae-Lemurnyssidae)))). We hypothesised that mites of the
   superfamilies Pterolichoidea, Analgoidea and Psoroptoidea have
   independently colonised birds with subsequent ancestral shifts of the
   families Lobalgidae and Psoroptidae and subfamily Paracoroptinae from
   birds to mammals. Mites of the superfamily Sarcoptoidea switched from
   nidicoly to parasitism on ancestors of therian mammals and evolved
   exclusively on this host group.},

Abstract = {Three new genera and five species of Taphurini from Sundaland (Malayan

   S. bimaculata sp. n. from Borneo and S. suffusca sp. n. from the Malayan
   Peninsula, Allobroma including A. kedenburgi (Breddin, 1905) comb. n.
   from Borneo and Banguey Island and A. portegiesi sp. n. from West
   Malaysia and southern Thailand, and Unduncus including U connexa
   (Distant, 1910) comb. n. from Borneo. The taxonomic position of the new
   genera is discussed. A new genus concept is proposed for Lemuriana
   Distant, 1905 that now includes two species, L. apicalis (Germar, 1830)
   from India and Nepal, and L. cambodiana Lee 2010 from Cambodia.
   Lemuriana chandaea Moulton, 1911 from Borneo is synonymized with
   Allobroma kedenburgi from Banguey Island. Abroma tahanensis Moulton,
   1923 from the Malayan Peninsula is transferred to the genus Muda
   Distant, 1897 in the tribe Chlorocystini. The occurrence in Sundaland of
   Abroma maculicollis (Guerin Meneville, 1838), described from Bengal,
   proved to be unlikely. The species of Taphurini known from South-East
   Asia but not recorded from Sundaland have been checked to be sure that
   these species are not identical to new species described here.},

Title = {EVOLUTION OF THE SIDE-NECKED TURTLES: THE FAMILY PODOCNEMIDIDAE},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2011},
Number = {350},
Pages = {1-237},
Abstract = {The family Podocnemididae consists of 20 genera and 30 species
   considered here as valid and diagnosable by cranial characters. Three of
   these genera and eight species persist into the Recent fauna, barely
   reflecting the evolutionary diversity and distribution of the group. The
   family extends from the Late Cretaceous to the Recent and occurs in
   North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. A phylogenetic
   analysis utilizes 31 podocnemidid taxa (30 named and one unnamed; a
   total of 37 taxa analyzed includes outgroups) in the Podocnemididae that
   are analyzed using PAUP. The resulting consensus of nine equally
   parsimonious cladograms is the basis for a new classification of the
   family. The family Podocnemididae is reconfirmed as monophyletic, using
   the unique possession of a cavum pterygoidei formed by the basisphenoid,
   pterygoid, prootic, and quadrate, underlain by the pterygoid and
   basisphenoid, among other characters. Much of our resolution agrees with
   that of Franca and Langer (2006), which can be modified and restated as
   follows: (Bauruemys (vilavilensis (Podocnemis (Peltocephalus,
   Erymnochelys)))). The two clades proposed by Broin (1991) and Lapparent
   de Broin (2000b, 2001, 2003a, 2003b), designated by her as the
   ``subfamily Podocnemidinae{''} and the ``subfamily Erymnochelinae,{''}
   are inconsistent with our analysis. In our analysis the
   ``Podocnemidinae{''} (sensu Broin, 1991) is paraphyletic, and the
   ``Erymnochelinae{''} (sensu Broin, 1991) could be made monophyletic,
   with the important addition of Peltocephalus (placed in the
   ``Podocnemidinae{''} by Broin).
   We add a number of new taxa to the basal Podocnemididae and to the
   broad-jawed subtribe Stereogenyina. Within the family Podocnemididae
   Cope, 1868, the sister taxon to all other podocnemidids and recognized
   as the subfamily Bauruemydinae, new, is Bauruemys elegans (Suarez,
   1969a), known from associated skulls and shells. All other
   podocnemidids, the redefined subfamily Podocnemidinae Cope, 1868, are
   united by a slight to absent temporal emargination, a completely closed
   foramen jugulare posterius, and saddle-shaped cervical centra (modified
   as a separate state in Erymnochelys). A basal group of
   Cretaceous-Paleocene podocnemidids that are the sister group to all
   remaining podocnemidids, here termed the infrafamily Peiropemydodda,
   consisting of two taxa from the late Cretaceous of Brazil, Peiropemys
   mezzalirai, n. gen. et sp., and Pricemys caiera, n. gen. et sp., and
   Lapparentemys (Broin, 1971), n. gen., from the Paleocene of Bolivia. The
   resolution of the basal members of the family is: (Bauruemys (Pricemys
   (Lapparentemys, Peiropemys)) (Infrafamily Podocnemidodda)).
   The remaining podocnemidids form the infrafamily Podocnemidodda Cope,
   1868, new rank, and is characterized by the possession of a cheek
   emargination that does not reach above the level of the orbit, the
   medial expansion of the triturating surfaces with a median maxillary
   ridge present, and the presence of accessory ridges on the triturating
   surfaces. This group contains the living podocnemidids and a series of
   extinct forms, including the marine broad-jawed taxa.
   Within the Podocnemidodda, the genus Podocnemis is the sister group to
   all the remaining taxa, which is the magnatribe Erymnochelydand. When
   only the living fauna is considered our results show Podocnemis as the
   sister taxon to Erymnochelys plus Peltocephalus, in common with Williams
   (1954c), Franca and Langer (2006), Meylan et al. (2009), and Cadena et
   al. (2010). With the fossil taxa present, the Erymnochelydand is united
   only by the small to absent cheek emargination. However, some of the
   fossil taxa (i.e., Caninemys, Dacquemys), are not known for a number of
   characters, and, if the analysis is reduced to include only the living
   species, Erymnochelys and Peltocephalus are united by a greater number
   of characters: cavum pterygoidei with enlarged anterior opening, so that
   the foramen cavernosum enters the roof of the cavum pterygoidei, orbits
   facing anterolaterally, jugal-quadrate contact present, cheek
   emargination slight to absent, horizontal occipital shelf absent,
   premaxillae reach apertura narium interim (also in some Podocnemis),
   supraoccipital roof exposure slight or absent, chorda tympani enclosed
   in processus retroarticularis, neural series extends to costal six, and
   axillary musk duct not in bridge.
   When one considers just the Recent genera, none of the published
   molecular results reproduce the Gaffney and Meylan (1988) and Lapparent
   de Broin (2000b) resolution of (Erymnochelys (Podocnemis,
   Peltocephalus)); rather these publications show a preference for the
   (Peltocephalus (Podocnemis, Erymnochelys)) arrangement, while we, in
   agreement with Franca and Langer (2006) and the earlier version of the
   present data set, Meylan et al. (2009), place our marbles with the third
   alternative, (Podocnemis (Peltocephalus, Erymnochelys)). This latter
   hypothesis has a number of characters favoring its resolution, even when
   fossils are excluded. One of the more compelling ones is the large cavum
   pterygoidei with an enlarged anterior opening and the foramen cavernosum
   containing the lateral head vein, entering the roof of the cavum
   pterygoidei.
   Within the magnatribe Erymnochelydand are the following taxa: Caninemys,
   Dacquemys, unnamed genus UCMP 42008, Albertwoodemys, Turkanemys,
   Peltocephalus, Erymnochelys, Neochelys, Papoulemys, and the members of
   the tribe Stereogenyini (see below). The resolution of Caninemys within
   the Erymnochelydand is not strongly supported; in only one step it
   becomes a multichotomy with Podocnemis and the infrafamily
   Peiropemydodda. Neochelys, Papoulemys (possibly a synonym of Neochelys),
   and Dacquemys, however, are strongly supported as part of the magnatribe
   Erymnochelydand, as proposed earlier (Broin, 1991; Lapparent de Broin,
   2000b, 2001, 2003a, 2003b).
   A new shell-based taxon, Albertwoodemys testudinum. n. gen. et sp., and
   an unnamed skull and shell, UCMP 42008, are united by a high-domed shell
   with thick lateral ridges along the plastron and the absence/fusion of
   the pectoral scales. The skull of UCMP 42008 agrees with that in
   Dacquemys in having large parietals and a supraoccipital covering the
   posterior margin. Lacking a skull, Albertwoodemys is not entered into
   the data set, but the skull-shell specimen of the closely related UCMP
   42008 is in the analysis.
   New skull material identifiable as Neochelys has been discovered
   associated with shells of ``Podocnemis{''} fajumensis Andrews, 1903,
   resulting in the new combination Neochelys fajumensis (Andrews, 1903).
   Neochelys has the Erymnochelydand synapomorphy of a large cavum
   pterygoidei with an enlarged anterior opening and the foramen cavernosum
   entering the roof of the cavum pterygoidei, as in Peltocephalus and
   Erymnochelys. The European Neochelys species are Eocene and the African
   Fayum species is Early Oligocene, extending both spatial and temporal
   ranges of the genus.
   The tribe Stereogenyini has a dorsal process of the palatine that
   reaches the frontal in the septum orbitotemporale, the fossa
   precolumellaris is absent, and both foramina nervi hypoglossi are
   combined and recessed in a short canal that opens on the occipital
   surface. Within the tribe Stereogenyini, Mogharemys blanckenhorni Dacque
   (1912), n. gen., is the sister taxon to the well-defined subtribe
   Stereogenyina.
   Two groups are recognized within the subtribe Stereogenyina. The
   infratribe Bairdemydita contains Bairdemys Gaffney and Wood, Latentemys
   plowdeni. n. gen. et sp., Cordichelys antiqua (Andrews, 1903), n. gen.
   The infratribe Stereogenyita contains Brontochelys gaffneyi (Wood,
   1970), n. gen., Lemurchelys diasphax, n. gen. et sp., Shweboemys
   Swinton, 1939, and Stereogenys Andrews, 1901. The subtribe Stereogenyina
   is strongly supported by a secondary palate with a median cleft, unique
   among turtles, as well as other characters. While the other
   Podocnemididae were apparently freshwater species, there is evidence
   that many or all of the subtribe Stereogenyina were marine or near-shore
   marine.
   Compared with a group such as the Bothremydidae, we see in the evolution
   of the Podocnemididae, a relatively conservative series of South
   American paraphyletic taxa with an unusually persistent cranial as well
   as shell morphology, beginning in the Late Cretaceous with Bauruemys,
   Peiropemys, and Pricemys, and continuing with the Paleocene
   Lapparentemys, culminating in the Recent Podocnemis. A monophyletic
   Tertiary group with more geographic, taxonomic, and morphologic
   diversity, the magnatribe Erymnochelydand, contains African, European,
   Asian, and South American taxa, as well as a radiation of marine,
   broad-jawed species in the mid-Tertiary. The living remnants of the
   Erymnochelydand are the South American Peltocephalus and the African
   Erymnochelys, close relatives despite their current geographic
   separation.},

   Many of the figures for this paper were done by artists working in the
   Visiting Artist program, under the mentoring of Frank Ippolito in the
   Division of Paleontology, AMNH. Each year since 1996, this program has
   supported a few artists, now more than 35, who were chosen for their
   skills and an interest in furthering a career in scientific
   illustration. We are very grateful to these artists for their work on

Title = {Conserving the Puerto Rican herpetofauna},
Booktitle = {CONSERVATION OF CARIBBEAN ISLAND HERPETOFAUNAS, VOL 2: REGIONAL ACCOUNTS
   OF THE WEST INDIES},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {339-357},
Abstract = {With a total area of 8900 km(2), Puerto Rico is the smallest of the
   Greater Antilles. It is divided in three physiographic regions or areas
   of relief: the mountainous interior, the karst region, and the coastal
   plains and valleys. The island comprises six ecological life zones:
   subtropical dry forest, subtropical moist forest, subtropical wet
   forest, subtropical rain forest, lower montane wet forest and lower
   montane rain forest. The herpetofauna of Puerto Rico consists of 25
   species of amphibians (19 native, six introduced) and 56 species of
   reptiles (52 native, four introduced). The goal of this paper is to
   describe some of the present studies directed towards the conservation
   of Puerto Rican herpetofauna. Eleutherodactylus karlschmidti, E. jasperi
   and E. eneidae have not been seen or heard since 1976, 1981 and 1990,
   respectively, and are probably extinct. Since 2000, the potential causes
   of amphibian declines in Puerto Rico have been studied, and a
   synergistic interaction between climate change (increased dry periods)
   and disease (chytridiomycosis) have been proposed as an explanation for
   the patterns observed. Recovery efforts for Peltophryne lemur include a
   captive-breeding program, reintroductions island-wide educational
   outreach, protection and restoration of existing habitat, and the
   creation of new breeding ponds. Among reptiles, the first conservation
   efforts to protect Epicrates inornatus were limited to trying to halt
   collection and hunting. However, current strategies to preserve the boa
   include gathering basic biological information, habitat conservation,
   and educational outreach. Recent efforts for the conservation of
   Trachemys s. stejnegeri combine three research approaches to clarify the
   status of local populations: a mark-recapture-release study, field
   monitoring of reproductive activity (i.e., nocturnal patrolling to
   identify nesting activity), and field assessment of the potential impact
   of introduced species, particularly identification of predatory species
   and exotic turtles. Recovery initiatives for Cyclura stejnegeri include
   management of invasive mammals, a headstart program for hatchling
   iguanas, and the assessment of the etiology of a condition causing
   blindness in adult iguanas. A reforestation project aimed at recovering
   a local herpetofaunal assemblage after disturbances in a limestone
   valley in northern Puerto Rico is discussed. As population sizes of
   common colonizers such as Eleutherodactylus and Anolis increased, larger
   forest-interior and predatory species like Epicrates inornatus, Alsophis
   portoricensis and Anolis cuvieri followed. Finally, the Mona Island
   marine turtle monitoring program is discussed and compared to other
   similar programs in Puerto Rico. As these and other similar conservation
   efforts provide scientifically based management recommendations, we hope
   to succeed in conserving the diverse herpetofauna that characterizes
   Puerto Rico.},

Title = {Organization and Molecular Evolution of CENP-A-Associated Satellite DNA
   Families in a Basal Primate Genome},
Journal = {GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {3},
Pages = {1136-1149},
Abstract = {Centromeric regions in many complex eukaryotic species contain highly
   repetitive satellite DNAs. Despite the diversity of centromeric DNA
   sequences among species, the functional centromeres in all species
   studied to date are marked by CENP-A, a centromere-specific histone H3
   variant. Although it is well established that families of multimeric
   higher-order alpha satellite are conserved at the centromeres of human
   and great ape chromosomes and that diverged monomeric alpha satellite is
   found in old and new world monkey genomes, little is known about the
   organization, function, and evolution of centromeric sequences in more
   distant primates, including lemurs. Aye-Aye (Daubentonia
   madagascariensis) is a basal primate and is located at a key position in
   the evolutionary tree to study centromeric satellite transitions in
   primate genomes. Using the approach of chromatin immunoprecipitation
   with antibodies directed to CENP-A, we have identified two satellite
   families, Daubentonia madagascariensis Aye-Aye 1 (DMA1) and Daubentonia
   madagascariensis Aye-Aye 2 (DMA2), related to each other but unrelated
   in sequence to alpha satellite or any other previously described primate
   or mammalian satellite DNA families. Here, we describe the initial
   genomic and phylogenetic organization of DMA1 and DMA2 and present
   evidence of higher-order repeats in Aye-Aye centromeric domains,
   providing an opportunity to study the emergence of chromosome-specific
   modes of satellite DNA evolution in primate genomes.},

   toes on each lever arm, splayed around a central housing. This anchor
   design is being developed for the Lemur IIb mobile robot. The anchor can
   also be used to support a coring drill. The work enables both mobility

Title = {Chromosome Painting in Two Genera of South American Monkeys: Species
   Identification, Conservation, and Management},
Journal = {CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {134},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-50},
Abstract = {Cytogenetic studies showed that a number of New World primate taxa,
   particularly the genera Alouatta, Aotus, and Callicebus, have highly
   derived karyotypes. Cytogenetics in these primates, at every level of
   analysis, has contributed to the recognition of species and revealed
   that their number was certainly underestimated by researchers relying
   solely on traditional morphological data. Further attention was drawn to
   Alouatta and Aotus because they are characterized by translocations of
   the Y chromosome to autosomes, generating multiple sex chromosome
   systems. Here we present a report on the hybridization of human
   chromosome-specific paints on metaphases from 4 individuals originally
   assigned to Alouatta caraya and 1 individual of Aotus lemurinus. This is
   only the third karyotype studied with chromosome painting out of more
   than 10 known karyomorphs in Aotus. The banded chromosomes matched those
   of karyotype II as defined by Ma et al. {[}1976a], and we were able to
   more precisely assign the origin of the sample to A. l. griseimembra.
   Our results on the Argentinean Alouatta caraya samples were generally
   comparable to the banding and hybridization pattern of previous studies
   of A. caraya including the presence of an X1X1X2X2/X1X2Y1Y2 sex
   chromosome system. The karyotype of the Brazilian Alouatta sample
   labeled as A. caraya differs from the 3 Argentinean samples by at least
   10 chromosome rearrangements. The diploid number, G banding, and
   hybridization pattern of this female cell line was almost identical to
   previous painting results on Alouatta guariba guariba. Therefore we must
   conclude that this cell line is actually from an A. guariba guariba
   individual. The contribution of cytogenetic tools in identifying species
   or in this case assigning individuals or cell lines to their precise
   taxonomic allocation is stressed. Gathering further molecular
   cytogenetic data on New World primates should be conservation and
   management priorities. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Title = {Encephalization, Expensive Tissues, and Energetics: An Examination of
   the Relative Costs of Brain Size in Strepsirrhines},

Abstract = {The evolution of encephalization requires that energetic challenges be
   met. Several hypotheses, such as the maternal energy and expensive
   tissue hypotheses, have been proposed to explain how some species are
   able to provide adequate energetic resources for large brains. The
   former incorporates maternal investment strategies, such as extended
   life history and elevated resting metabolic rate, which contribute to
   the growth of a large brain. The latter incorporates the reduction of
   gut size, which increases available energy for the maintenance of adult
   brain size. This study examines a sample of strepsirrhines, testing the
   hypothesis that encephalized species utilize some combination of the
   above-mentioned strategies. Infants and juveniles from three species at
   the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) were measured periodically to arrive at head
   and body growth trajectories. These data were used to determine the
   energetic tradeoff among the offspring. The examination of gestation
   length, weaning age, intestinal size and resting metabolic rate was used
   to assess adult brain maintenance and maternal energetic contribution.
   The results reveal that Daubentonia, the most encephalized and thus
   human-like of the lemurs, does not experience an energetic trade-off
   between brain and body during ontogeny, but does exhibit a trade-off
   between extensive brain growth and possibly reduced intestinal growth.
   Also, maternal energy is utilized. Encephalized lemurs, such as
   Daubentonia, have higher resting metabolic rate, while encephalized
   lorisiforms have a longer period of gestation. These results demonstrate
   that there are several strategies for meeting the energetic demands of
   encephalization, and they can be manifested differentially across taxa.

Abstract = {The N-terminal region of the mammalian prion protein (PrP) contains an
   `octapeptide' repeat which is involved in copper binding. This eight- or
   nine-residue peptide is repeated four to seven times, depending on the
   species, and polymorphisms in repeat number do occur. Alleles with three
   repeats are very rare in humans and goats, and deduced PrP sequences
   with two repeats have only been reported in two lemur species and in the
   red squirrel, Sciurus vulgaris. We here describe that the red squirrel
   two-repeat PrP sequence actually represents a retroposed pseudogene, and
   that an additional and older processed pseudogene with three repeats
   also occurs in this species as well as in ground squirrels. We argue
   that repeat numbers may tend to contract rather than expand in prion
   retropseudogenes, and that functional prion genes with two repeats may
   not be viable.},

Title = {Stranger to Familiar: Wild Strepsirhines Manage Xenophobia by Playing},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {The power of play in limiting xenophobia is a well-known phenomenon in
   humans. Yet, the evidence in social animals remains meager. Here, we aim
   to determine whether play promotes social tolerance toward strangers in
   one of the most basal group of primates, the strepsirhines. We observed
   two groups of wild lemurs (Propithecus verreauxi, Verreaux's sifaka)
   during the mating season. Data were also collected on nine visiting,
   outgroup males. We compared the distribution of play, grooming, and
   aggressive interactions across three conditions: OUT (resident/outgroup
   interactions), IN (resident/resident interactions in presence of
   outgroups) and BL-IN (baseline of resident/resident interactions in
   absence of outgroups). Play frequency between males was higher in OUT
   than in IN and BL-IN conditions; whereas, grooming was more frequent in
   IN than in OUT and BL-IN conditions. Aggression rates between resident
   and outgroup males were significantly higher than those between
   residents. However, aggressions between resident and outgroup males
   significantly decreased after the first play session and became
   comparable with resident-resident aggression levels. The presence of
   strangers in a well-established group implies the onset of novel social
   circumstances, which sifaka males cope with by two different tactics:
   grooming with ingroup males and playing with outgroup ones. The grooming
   peak, concurrently with the visit of outgroups, probably represents a
   social shield adopted by resident males to make their pre-existing
   affiliation more evident to the stranger ``audience''. Being mostly
   restricted to unfamiliar males, adult play in sifaka appears to have a
   role in managing new social situations more than in maintaining old
   relationships. In particular, our results indicate not only that play is
   the interface between strangers but also that it has a specific function
   in reducing xenophobia. In conclusion, play appears to be an ice-breaker
   mechanism in the critical process that ``upgrades'' an individual from
   stranger to familiar.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Hans Strahl, a contemporary of Duval and Hubrecht, made many important
   contributions to comparative placentation. Despite this he is not well
   known and some of his original observations tend to be attributed to
   later authors. Strahl published a classification of placental types
   based on their shape and relationship to maternal tissues. This greatly
   influenced the work of Otto Grosser, who became better known in part
   because his work was more accessible to other scientists and clinicians.
   Strahl described the development of the fetal membranes across a broad
   range of mammalian orders extending his observations beyond parturition
   to the post partum involution of the uterus. He paid close attention to
   structures designed for histotrophic nutrition including the areolae of
   moles, haemophagous organs of carnivores and tenrecs and chorionic
   vesicles of lemurs and lorises. We here provide a summary of some of the
   most important findings made by Strahl including work on placentation in
   carnivores and higher primates that remains unsurpassed. (c) 2010

Abstract = {Lentiviruses are widespread in a variety of vertebrates, often
   associated with chronic disease states. However, until the recent
   discovery of the prehistoric endogenous lentiviruses in rabbits (RELIK)
   and lemurs (PSIV), it was thought that lentiviruses had no capacity for
   germline integration and were only spread horizontally in an exogenous
   fashion. The existence of RELIK and PSIV refuted these ideas, revealing
   lentiviruses to be present in a range of mammals, capable of germline
   integration, and far more ancient than previously thought. Using Gag
   sequences reconstructed from the remnants of these prehistoric
   lentiviruses, we have produced chimeric lentiviruses capable of
   infecting nondividing cells and determined structures of capsid domains
   from PSIV and RELIK. We show that the structures from these diverse
   viruses are highly similar, containing features found in modern-day
   lentiviruses, including a functional cyclophilin-binding loop. Together,
   these data provide evidence for an ancient capsid-cyclophilin
   interaction preserved throughout lentiviral evolution.},

Abstract = {The likely future extinction of various species will result in a decline
   of two quantities: species richness and phylogenetic diversity (PD, or
   `evolutionary history'). Under a simple stochastic model of extinction,
   we can estimate the expected loss of these quantities under two
   conservation strategies: An `egalitarian' approach, which reduces the
   extinction risk of all species, and a `targeted' approach that
   concentrates conservation effort on the most endangered taxa. For two
   such strategies that are constrained to experience the same expected
   loss of species richness, we ask which strategy results in a greater
   expected loss of PD. Using mathematical analysis and simulation, we
   describe how the strategy (egalitarian versus targeted) that minimizes
   the expected loss of PD depends on the distribution of endangered status
   across the tips of the tree, and the interaction of this status with the
   branch lengths. For a particular data set consisting of a phylogenetic
   tree of 62 lemur species, with extinction risks estimated from the IUCN
   `Red List', we show that both strategies are virtually equivalent,
   though randomizing these extinction risks across the tip taxa can cause
   either strategy to outperform the other. In the second part of the
   paper, we describe an algorithm to determine how extreme the loss of PD
   for a given decline in species richness can be. We illustrate the use of
   this algorithm on the lemur tree. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Identification, classification and evolution of Owl Monkeys (Aotus,
   Illiger 1811)},
Journal = {BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {Background: Owl monkeys, belonging to the genus Aotus, have been
   extensively used as animal models in biomedical research but few reports
   have focused on the taxonomy and phylogeography of this genus. Moreover,
   the morphological similarity of several Aotus species has led to
   frequent misidentifications, mainly at the boundaries of their
   distribution. In this study, sequence data from five mitochondrial
   regions and the nuclear, Y-linked, SRY gene were used for species
   identification and phylogenetic reconstructions using well characterized
   specimens of Aotus nancymaae, A. vociferans, A. lemurinus, A.
   griseimembra, A. trivirgatus, A. nigriceps, A. azarae boliviensis and A.
   infulatus.
   Results: The complete MT CO1, MT TS1, MT TD, MT CO2, MT CYB regions were
   sequenced in 18 Aotus specimens. ML and Bayesian topologies of
   concatenated data and separate regions allowed for the proposition of a
   tentative Aotus phylogeny, indicating that Aotus diverged some 4.62
   Million years before present (MYBP). Similar analyses with included
   GenBank specimens were useful for assessing species identification of
   deposited data.
   Conclusions: Alternative phylogenetic reconstructions, when compared
   with karyotypic and biogeographic data, led to the proposition of
   evolutionary scenarios questioning the conventional diversification of
   this genus in monophyletic groups with grey and red necks. Moreover,
   genetic distance estimates and haplotypic differences were useful for
   species validations.},

Abstract = {The surveyed microflora was recovered from six cores from the Tonono x-1
   well in northwestern Argentina. Most of the studied interval corresponds
   to the Tonono Formation, i.e., the upper part to the Jollin Member and
   the basal part of the interval may be related to the Michicola
   Formation. The microflora totals 73 species represented by trilete
   spores (35 species), microplankton (30 species) including
   prasinophycean, acritarch and chlorophycean algae and chitinozoans (8
   species). The stratigraphic distribution of these species allowed the
   definition of three associations. The palynoassemblage To1 (3946,5 -
   3638,5 m) is characterized by species such as Grandispora
   douglastownense Mc Gregor, Dibolisporites eifeliensis (Lanninger)
   McGregor, Verrucosisporites sp. cf. V. loboziakii Marshall and Fletcher,
   Alpenachitina matogrossensis Burjack and Paris, Alpenachitina sp. cf. A.
   eisenacki Dunn and Miller and Ancyrochitina simplex Grahn, Bergamaschi
   and Pereira suggesting a late Eifelian to earliest Givetian age. Based
   on the presence of Geminospora lemurata Balme, Aneurospora greggsii
   (McGregor) Streel, Biharisporites parviornatus Richardson, Raistrickia
   aratra Allen and Leiotriletes balapucencis di Pasquo a Givetian age is
   proposed for palynoassemblage To2 (3367,35 - 3285 m). Palynoassemblage
   To3 (3073,2 - 3137,5 m) is predominantly composed of marine elements
   together with AOM. Few key species are recognized; however the presence
   of Acinosporites sp. cf. A. eumammillatus Loboziak, Streel and Burjack
   together with the chitinozoans Angochitina katzeri Grahn and Melo and
   Angochitina mourai Lange support an early Frasnian age. The distinctive
   increase of marine elements and AOM between To2 and To3 suggests that a
   maximum flooding event would have occurred there during this period.},

Abstract = {We investigated two mitochondrial genes (cytb and cox1), one plastid
   gene (tufA), and one nuclear gene (ldh) in blood samples from 12
   chimpanzees and two gorillas from Cameroon and one lemur from
   Madagascar. One gorilla sample is related to Plasmodium falciparum, thus
   confirming the recently reported presence in gorillas of this parasite.
   The second gorilla sample is more similar to the recently defined
   Plasmodium gaboni than to the P. falciparum-Plasmodium reichenowi clade,
   but distinct from both. Two chimpanzee samples are P. falciparum. A
   third sample is P. reichenowi and two others are P. gaboni. The other
   chimpanzee samples are different from those in the ape clade: two are
   Plasmodium ovale, and one is Plasmodium malariae. That is, we have found
   three human Plasmodium parasites in chimpanzees. Four chimpanzee samples
   were mixed: one species was P. reichenowi; the other species was P.
   gaboni in three samples and P. ovale in the fourth sample. The lemur
   sample, provisionally named Plasmodium malagasi, is a sister lineage to
   the large cluster of primate parasites that does not include P.
   falciparum or ape parasites, suggesting that the falciparum + ape
   parasite cluster (Laverania clade) may have evolved from a parasite
   present in hosts not ancestral to the primates. If malignant malaria
   were eradicated from human populations, chimpanzees, in addition to
   gorillas, might serve as a reservoir for P. falciparum.},

Title = {Diet, Activity Patterns, and Ranging Ecology of the Bale Monkey

Abstract = {Bale monkeys (Chlorocebus djamdjamensis) are little-known primates
   endemic to the forests of the Bale Massif and Hagere Selam regions of
   Ethiopia. From August 2007 to May 2008, we conducted the first ever
   study of the species' behavior and ecology, focusing in particular on
   its diet, activity patterns, and ranging ecology in the Odobullu Forest.
   We studied 2 neighboring groups (group A: 55-60 members; group B: 46-50
   members) and conducted behavioral scan samples on the first 2-5
   individuals sighted at 15-min intervals. Feeding accounted for 65.7\% of
   the activity budget, followed by moving (14.4\%), resting (10.7\%),
   social (7.1\%), and other behaviors (2.4\%). Overall diet during the
   study was dominated by young leaves (80.2\%), though subjects also ate
   fruits (9.6\%), flowers (3.1\%), animal prey (2.3\%), shoots (1.5\%),
   stems (1.4\%), mature leaves (1.1\%), and roots (0.9\%). Bale monkeys
   consumed only 11 plant species; of these, the top 5 species accounted
   for 94.3\% of their diet. The top food item, bamboo (Arundinaria
   alpina), was responsible for a remarkable 76.7\% of their diet, with
   most (95.2\%) of the bamboo consumption consisting of young leaves. Mean
   daily path length for the study groups was 928 m and mean (100\% minimum
   convex polygon) home range size was 15.2 ha. Though we are cautious in
   drawing conclusions from only 2 groups, the larger group traveled
   further per day and occupied a larger home range, patterns suggesting
   scramble competition may be occurring in Bale monkey groups at Odobullu.
   The dietary specialization of Bale monkeys on bamboo makes them unique
   among Chlorocebus spp. and suggests an intriguing ecological convergence
   with the golden monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis kandti) of Uganda and
   bamboo lemurs (Hapalemur spp.) of Madagascar. Their narrow ecological
   niche, limited geographic distribution, and bamboo harvesting by local
   people for commercial purposes place Bale monkeys at risk of extinction.
   To ensure the long-term survival of Bale monkeys, appropriate management
   action should be taken to conserve the species and the bamboo forests
   upon which it depends.},

Abstract = {The mammalian endogenous circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nuclei,
   receives environmental inputs, namely the light-dark cycle, through
   photopigments located in the eye and from melanopsin-expressing retinal
   ganglion cells. The authors investigated the influence of light
   wavelength and intensity on the synchronization of the rest-activity
   rhythm of the gray mouse lemur, a nocturnal Malagasy primate. Animals
   were tested at different irradiance levels (320, 45, 13, and 6
   nmol.m(-2).s(-1)) under several light wavelengths (from 400 to 610 nm).
   Several parameters including circadian period, activity, and body
   temperature waveforms were used to assess synchronization to a 12:12
   light-dark cycle in comparison to control treatments (12:12 white light
   or continuous darkness). Entrainment of the circadian rest-activity
   cycle increased with light intensity. It was more efficient for mid
   wavelengths relative to shorter or longer wavelengths but not coincident
   with melanopsin maximal sensitivity, suggesting other photoreceptors are
   likely involved in lemurs' photoentrainment. The authors obtained a
   novel synchronization pattern characterized by a clear synchronization
   to lights-on only without phasing to lights-off. Changes in
   photo-responsiveness at dusk and dawn highlight differential responses
   of evening and morning oscillators in the circadian clock.},

Abstract = {Cooperative hunting has been documented for several group-living

   hunting for a solitary species, the Malagasy fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox).
   We observed a 45 min hunt of a 3 kg arboreal primate by three male
   fossas. The hunters changed roles during the hunt and subsequently
   shared the prey. We hypothesize that social hunting in fossas could have
   either evolved to take down recently extinct larger lemur prey, or that
   it could be a by-product of male sociality that is beneficial for other
   reasons.},

Title = {Production and perception of situationally variable alarm calls in wild

Abstract = {Many mammalian and avian species produce conspicuous vocalizations upon
   encountering a predator, but vary their calling based on risk urgency
   and/or predator type. Calls falling into the latter category are termed
   ``functionally referential{''} if they also elicit predator-appropriate
   reactions in listeners. Functionally referential alarm calling has been
   well documented in a number of Old World monkeys and lemurs, but
   evidence among Neotropical primates is limited. This study investigates
   the alarm call system of tufted capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella nigritus)
   by examining responses to predator and snake decoys encountered at
   various distances (reflecting differences in risk urgency). Observations
   in natural situations were conducted to determine if predator-associated
   calls were given in additional contexts. Results indicate the use of
   three call types. ``Barks{''} are elicited exclusively by aerial
   threats, but the call most commonly given to terrestrial threats (the
   ``hiccup{''}) is given in nonpredatory contexts. The rate in which this
   latter call is produced reflects risk urgency. Playbacks of these two
   call types indicate that each elicits appropriate antipredator
   behaviors. The third call type, the ``peep,{''} seems to be specific to
   terrestrial threats, but it is unknown if the call elicits
   predator-specific responses. ``Barks{''} are thus functionally
   referential aerial predator calls, while ``hiccups{''} are better seen
   as generalized disturbance calls which reflect risk urgency. Further
   evidence is needed to draw conclusions regarding the ``peep.{''} These
   results add to the evidence that functionally referential aerial
   predator alarm calls are ubiquitous in primates, but that noncatarrhine
   primates use generalized disturbance calls in response to terrestrial
   threats.},

Abstract = {The architectural arrangement of the fibers within a muscle has a
   significant impact on how a muscle functions. Recent work on primate
   jaw-muscle architecture demonstrates significant associations with
   dietary variation and feeding behaviors. In this study, the relationship
   between masseter and temporalis muscle architecture and jaw-muscle
   activity patterns is explored using Belanger's treeshrews and 11 primate
   species, including two genera of strepsirrhines (Lemur and Otolemur) and
   five genera of anthropoids (Aotus, Callithrix, Cebus, Macaca, and
   Papio). Jaw-muscle weights, fiber lengths, and physiologic
   cross-sectional areas (PCSA) were quantified for this preliminary
   analysis or collected from the literature and compared to published
   electromyographic recordings from these muscles. Results indicate that
   masseter architecture is unrelated to the superficial masseter
   working-side/balancing-side (W/B) ratio across primate species.
   Alternatively, relative temporalis architecture is correlated with
   temporalis W/B ratios across primates. Specifically, relative temporalis
   PCSA is inversely related to the W/B ratio for the anterior temporalis,
   indicating that as animals recruit a larger relative percentage of their
   balancing-side temporalis, they possess the ability to generate
   relatively larger amounts of force from these muscles. These findings
   support three broader conclusions. First, masseter muscle architecture
   may have experienced divergent evolution across different primate clades
   related to novel functional roles in different groups. Second, the
   temporalis may be functionally constrained (relative to the masseter)
   across primates in its functional role of creating vertical occlusal
   forces during chewing. Finally, the contrasting results for the masseter
   and temporalis suggest that the fiber architecture of these muscles has
   evolved as distinct functional units in primates. Anat Rec, 293:572-582,

Abstract = {A fatal Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection epidemic involving
   fifteen primates occurred between October 2006 and February 2007 at the
   Natura Viva Zoo. This large open-field zoo park located near Lake Garda
   in Northern Italy hosts one thousand animals belonging to one hundred
   and fifty different species, including various lemur species. This lemur
   collection is the most relevant and rich in Italy. A second outbreak
   between September and November 2008 involved three lemurs. In all cases,
   the clinical signs were sudden deaths generally without any evident
   symptoms or only with mild unspecific clinical signs. Gross pathologic
   changes were characterized by myocarditis (diffuse or focal pallor of
   the myocardium), pulmonary congestion, emphysema, oedema and thoracic
   fluid. The EMCV was isolated and recognized as the causative agent of
   both outbreaks. The first outbreak in particular was associated with a
   rodent plague, confirming that rats are an important risk factor for the
   occurrence of the EMCV infection.},

Abstract = {The ages of the oldest fossils suggest an origin for primates in the
   Paleocene (similar to 56 Ma). Fossil-calibrated molecular clock dates
   give Cretaceous dates (similar to 80-116 Ma). Both these estimates are
   minimum dates although they are often `transmogrified' and treated as
   maximum or absolute dates. Oldest fossils can underestimate ages by tens
   of millions of years and instead of calibrating the time-course of
   evolution with a scanty fossil record, the geographical boundaries of
   the main molecular clades of primates are calibrated here with
   radiometrically dated tectonic events. This indicates that primates
   originated when a globally widespread ancestor (early Archonta)
   differentiated into a northern group (Plesiadapiformes, extinct), a
   southern group (Primates), and two south-east Asian groups (Dermoptera
   and Scandentia). The division occurred with the breakup of Pangea in the
   Early Jurassic and the opening of the central Atlantic (similar to 185
   Ma). Within primates, the strepsirrhines and haplorhines diverged with
   volcanism and buckling on the Lebombo Monocline, a volcanic rifted
   margin in south-east Africa (Early Jurassic, similar to 180 Ma). Within
   strepsirrhines, lorises and galagos (Africa and Asia) and lemurs
   (Madagascar) diverged with the formation of the Mozambique Channel
   (Middle Jurassic, similar to 160 Ma). Within haplorhines, Old World
   monkeys and New World monkeys diverged with the opening of the Atlantic
   (Early Cretaceous, similar to 130 Ma). The main aspects of primate
   distribution are interpreted as the result of plate tectonics, phylogeny
   and vicariance, with some subsequent range expansion leading to
   secondary overlap. Long-distance, trans-oceanic dispersal events are not
   necessary. The primate ancestral complex was already widespread globally
   when sea-floor spreading, strike-slip rifting and orogeny fractured and
   deformed distributions through the Jurassic and Cretaceous, leading to
   the origin of the modern clades. The model suggests that the topology of
   the phylogenetic tree reflects a sequence of differentiation in a
   widespread ancestor rather than a series of dispersal events.},

Abstract = {Ehrlichia chaffeensis, an intracellular gram-negative zoonotic
   bacterium, is the causative agent of human morrocytotropic ehrlichiosis
   (HME). In humans, the disease can range from a mild, non-specific
   illness with few to no clinical signs to a moderately severe to fatal
   disease, especially those with compromised immune systems. E.
   chaffeensis is maintained in a complex cycle involving white-tailed deer
   (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus) as a primary reservoir and the lone star
   tick (LST; Amblyomma americanum) as a primary vector. Numerous other
   species are naturally exposed to E. chaffeensis and disease has been
   documented in some domestic animals and wildlife including domestic dogs
   and ring-tailed lemurs. The organism has been found throughout the
   natural range of the LST and as the tick continues to expand its range,
   the geographic range of risk for E. chaffeensis infections will likely
   continue to expand. Recent data have indicated that E. chaffeensis, or a
   closely related organism, has been found in many species of ticks and
   vertebrate hosts in numerous countries. (C) 2009 Elsevier BLV. All

Title = {Effects of Caller Characteristics on Auditory Laterality in an Early
   Primate (Microcebus murinus)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 3},
Abstract = {Background: Auditory laterality is suggested to be characterized by a
   left hemisphere dominance for the processing of conspecific
   communication. Nevertheless, there are indications that auditory
   laterality can also be affected by communicative significance, emotional
   valence and social recognition.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to gain insight into the
   effects of caller characteristics on auditory laterality in the early
   primate brain, 17 gray mouse lemurs were tested in a head turn paradigm.
   The head turn paradigm was established to examine potential functional
   hemispheric asymmetries on the behavioral level. Subjects were presented
   with playbacks of two conspecific call types (tsak calls and trill
   calls) from senders differing in familiarity (unfamiliar vs. familiar)
   and sex (same sex vs. other sex). Based on the head turn direction
   towards these calls, evidence was found for a right ear/left hemisphere
   dominance for the processing of calls of the other sex (Binomial test: p
   = 0.021, N = 10). Familiarity had no effect on the orientation biases.
   Conclusions/Significance: The findings in this study support the growing
   consensus that auditory laterality is not only determined by the
   acoustic processing of conspecific communication, but also by other
   factors like the sex of the sender.},

   Irdinmanha Formation of Inner Mongolia, China. The new taxon is
   particularly similar to Tarka and Tarkadectes, but it also displays many
   features observed in omomyids. A phylogenetic analysis based on a data
   matrix including 59 taxa and 444 dental characters suggests that
   Tarkops, Tarka and Tarkadectes form a monophyletic group-the
   Tarkadectinae-that is nested within the omomyid clade. Within Omomyidae,
   tarkadectines appear to be closely related to Macrotarsius. Dermoptera,
   including extant and extinct flying lemurs and plagiomenids, is
   recognized as a clade nesting within the polyphyletic group of
   plesiadapiforms, therefore supporting the previous suggestion that the
   relationship between dermopterans and primates is as close as that
   between plesiadapiforms and primates. The distribution of tarkadectine
   primates on both sides of the Pacific Ocean basin suggests that
   palaeoenvironmental conditions appropriate to sustain primates occurred
   across a vast expanse of Asia and North America during the Middle
   Eocene.},

Abstract = {MADAGASCAR'S BAOBABS: TESTING THE ANACHRONISTIC SEED DISPERSION
   HYPOTHESIS
   Seed dispersion from Madagascar's baobabs, Adansonia spp., never seems
   to have been formally studied to date. Assumptions exist, which we have
   set out in this summary of the bibliography. While humans seem to have
   an important role in Adansonia digitata seed dispersion in Africa, this
   assumption is rarely mentioned for the Malagasy species. Several authors
   have put forward a hypothesis of anachronistic seed dispersion since
   Madagascar's megafauna became extinct; others suggest that introduced
   vertebrates may be involved. The possible role of elephant-birds,
   Aepyornis spp., giant tortoises, Aldabrachelys spp., and giant lemurs,
   extinct or not, is mentioned in particular, as against that of
   introduced animals such as the zebu, Bos indicus, or bush pigs,
   Potamochoerus larvatus. Ex situ experiments with indigenous or
   introduced species, some of which have a morphology or phylogenesis
   similar to that of extinct vertebrates, could shed light on the puzzle
   of baobab seed dispersion in Madagascar.},
