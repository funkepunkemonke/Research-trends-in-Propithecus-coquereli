Title = {The influence of riverine barriers on phylogeographic patterns of
   Malagasy reed frogs (Heterixalus)},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We analyzed the influence of large rivers on the phylogeography of
   endemic widespread amphibians along Madagascar's east coast, using as
   models various species and species complexes of Malagasy reed frogs
   (Heterixalus spp.) that are specialized to either highland or lowland
   habitats. We assembled a dense sampling across the full species ranges
   and used mitochondria! (cob) as well as nuclear (Rag-1) DNA sequences to
   assess their phylogeographies. A multigene mtDNA phylogeny of each
   species was constructed to establish the relationships among the main
   phylogroups, in order to understand the geographical regions of clade
   origins and possible directions of historical range expansions. Distinct
   intraspecific lineages as diagnosed by mitochondrial haplotype clades
   were found in highlands and lowlands. Most geographical boundaries among
   these phylogroups did not coincide with rivers, indicating that the
   influence of rivers on the primary divergence of phylogroups is probably
   minor in these frogs. Nevertheless, we found evidence for the influence
   of one riverine barrier in the lowland species complex, where the most
   important genetic discontinuity (the border between Heterixalus
   madagascariensis and H. alboguttatus) coincides with the geographical
   position of the Mangoro River on Madagascar's central east coast.
   Analyses of the highland species H. betsileo revealed the existence of
   six deep haplotype lineages, separated in two major subpopulations which
   differ largely in altitudinal distribution and do not overlap with the
   geographical settings of rivers in the highlands. Furthermore, our
   analyses indicated that most of the major intraspecific lineages of reed
   frogs show signs of a rather recent population expansion. (C) 2012

Title = {Disability, Compensatory Behavior, and Innovation in Free-Ranging Adult
   Female Japanese Macaques (Macaca Fuscata)},

Volume = {74},

Abstract = {Little is known about consequences of disability in nonhuman primates,
   yet individuals with disabilities can reveal much about behavioral
   flexibility, innovation, and the capabilities of a species. The Macaca
   fuscata population surrounding the Awajishima Monkey Center has
   experienced high rates of congenital limb malformation for at least 40
   years, creating a unique opportunity to examine consequences of physical
   impairment in situ, in a relatively large sample of free-ranging adult
   monkeys. Here we present behavioral data on 11 disabled adult females
   and 12 nondisabled controls from 279 hours of randomly ordered 30-minute
   focal animal follows collected during MayAugust in 2005, 2006, and 2007.
   We quantified numerous statistically significant disability-related
   behavioral differences among females. Disabled females spent less time
   begging for peanuts from tourists, and employed a behavioral variant of
   such peanut begging; they had a lower frequency of hand use in grooming
   and compensated with increased direct use of the mouth or a two-arm
   pinch technique; and they had a higher frequency of self-scratching, and
   more use of feet in self-scratching. Self-scratching against substrates
   was almost exclusively a disability associated behavior. Two females
   used habitual bipedalism. These differences not withstanding, disabled
   females behaved similarly to controls in many respects: overall reliance
   on provisioned and wild foods, time spent feeding, and feeding
   efficiency did not differ among females, and there was no time
   difference in behavior performed arboreally or terrestrially. Disabled
   adult females were able to compensate behaviorally to perform social and
   life-sustaining activities, modifying existing behaviors to suit their
   individual physical situations and, occasionally, inventing new ways of
   doing things. Am. J. Primatol. 74:788-803, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {Few mammals-cetaceans, domestic cats and select bats and rodents-can
   send and receive vocal signals contained within the ultrasonic domain,
   or pure ultrasound (greater than 20 kHz). Here, we use the auditory
   brainstem response (ABR) method to demonstrate that a species of
   nocturnal primate, the Philippine tarsier (Tarsius syrichta), has a
   high-frequency limit of auditory sensitivity of ca 91 kHz. We also
   recorded a vocalization with a dominant frequency of 70 kHz. Such values
   are among the highest recorded for any terrestrial mammal, and a
   relatively extreme example of ultrasonic communication. For Philippine
   tarsiers, ultrasonic vocalizations might represent a private channel of
   communication that subverts detection by predators, prey and
   competitors, enhances energetic efficiency, or improves detection
   against low-frequency background noise.},

Abstract = {One emerging facet of e-government is Internet voting, or i-voting.
   I-voting refers to the secure transmission of a ballot via the Internet.
   This phenomenon has the potential to increase citizen participation in
   the democratic process. However, few studies have identified the unique
   characteristics that make i-voting an appealing option. In particular,
   there is a need for research that identifies the impacts of both
   technological and political factors on intentions to use an Internet
   voting system. In this study, we propose a model inclusive of
   technological, situational and political factors. To test the model we
   administer a survey to a diverse pool of citizens with regards to age,
   income, and education. Results indicate that relative advantage and
   trust of the Internet impact intentions to use Internet voting, while
   party mobilization and political interest impact propensity to vote.
   Further, it was found that perceived Internet accessibility impacts the
   perceived convenience of voting online, which in turn impacts the
   perceived relative advantage of online voting. Implications of these
   findings for research and practice are discussed. We conclude with
   recommendations for future research. As local and state governments
   begin to experiment with internet voting, now is the time to identify
   the Internet-specific characteristics that will attract non-voters and
   retain habitual voters.},

Abstract = {Understanding the remarkably high species diversity and levels of
   endemism found among Madagascars flora and fauna has been the focus of
   many studies. One hypothesis that has received much attention proposes
   that Quaternary climate fluctuations spurred diversification. While
   spatial patterns of distribution and phylogenetic relationships can
   provide support for biogeographic predictions, temporal estimates of
   divergence are required to determine the fit of these geospatial
   patterns to climatic or biogeographic mechanisms. We use multilocus DNA
   sequence data to test whether divergence times among Malagasy iguanid
   lizards of the subfamily Oplurinae are compatible with a hypotheses of
   PliocenePleistocene diversification. We estimate the oplurine species
   tree and associated divergence times under a relaxed-clock model. In
   addition, we examine the phylogeographic structure and population
   divergence times within two sister species of Oplurus primarily
   distributed in the north-west and south-west of Madagascar (Oplurus
   cuvieri and Oplurus cyclurus, respectively). We find that divergence
   events among oplurine lineages occurred in the Oligocene and Miocene and
   are thus far older and incompatible with the hypothesis that recent
   climate fluctuations are related to current species diversity. However,
   the timing of intraspecific divergences and spatial patterns of
   population genetic structure within O.similar to cuvieri and O.similar
   to cyclurus suggest a role for both intrinsic barriers and recent
   climate fluctuations at population-level divergences. Integrating
   information across spatial and temporal scales allows us to identify and
   better understand the mechanisms generating patterns diversity.},

Title = {Infant Mortality in Black-and-Gold Howlers (Alouatta caraya) Living in a

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {Ecological and social factors have a significant effect on infant
   survivorship in nonhuman primates. We present 6293 group-months of
   infant birth and mortality data for 29 groups of Alouatta caraya
   inhabiting a flooded forest in northeastern Argentina, collected over
   1.5-8 yr depending on the group. We tested whether infant mortality was
   a response to the effects of flooding on food availability and whether
   male takeovers resulted in greater opportunities for infanticide. During
   our study, 43 of 113 infants died at a mean age of 5 mo. In 24 cases the
   cause of death was unknown. In the remaining 19 cases infant deaths were
   attributed to periods of intense flooding (N = 8), replacement of the
   breeding male (N = 8), problems associated with birth (N = 2), and
   injuries during an intergroup encounter (N = 1). Flooding reduced the
   availability of mature leaves, which appeared to play an important role
   in the ability of mothers to nurse their offspring. Male replacements
   occurred in four social groups that contained only one fully adult male.
   Infant mortality was significantly higher in groups that experienced
   male replacement compared to groups without male replacement. These
   results indicate that infant mortality in Alouatta caraya is affected by
   several factors-natural disasters, maternal condition and food
   availability, infanticide after male replacement, and possibly disease
   and predation-each of which needs to be evaluated to understand the
   history and demography of this primate population.},

Abstract = {Opportunities for Internet use in the political process are constantly
   emerging. The use of the Internet to obtain political news and share
   political information is gaining momentum. Remote Internet voting
   initiatives are also growing in popularity. This study presents a model
   of Internet voting adoption that explores the predictors of the
   perceived usefulness of Internet voting systems. To test the model a
   survey is administered to 372 citizens. The results of structural
   equation modeling indicate that accessibility, convenience, disposition
   to trust, and Internet trust all have a significant impact on the
   perceived usefulness of Internet Voting. Implications for research and
   practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {Chagas disease, an important cause of heart disease in Latin America, is
   caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which typically is transmitted
   to humans by triatomine insects. Although autochthonous transmission of
   the Chagas parasite to humans is rare in the United States, triatomines
   are common, and more than 20 species of mammals are infected with the
   Chagas parasite in the southern United States. Chagas disease has also
   been detected in colonies of nonhuman primates (NHP) in Georgia and
   Texas, and heart abnormalities consistent with Chagas disease have
   occurred at our NHP center in Louisiana. To determine the level of T.
   cruzi infection, we serologically tested 2157 of the approximately 4200
   NHP at the center; 34 of 2157 primates (1.6\%) tested positive. Presence
   of the T. cruzi parasite was confirmed by hemoculture in 4 NHP and PCR
   of the cultured parasites. These results strongly suggest local
   transmission of T. cruzi, because most of the infected NHP were born and
   raised at this site. All 3 species of NHP tested yielded infected
   animals, with significantly higher infection prevalence in pig-tailed
   macaques, suggesting possible exploration of this species as a model
   organism. The local T. cruzi strain isolated during this study would
   enhance such investigations. The NHP at this center are bred for use in
   scientific research, and the effects of the Chagas parasite on infected
   primates could confuse the interpretation of other studies.},

Title = {Detecting cryptic speciation in the widespread and morphologically

Abstract = {Species delimitation within recently evolved groups can be challenging
   because species may be difficult to distinguish morphologically.
   Following the General Lineage Concept, we apply a multiple evidence
   approach to assess species limits within the carpet chameleon Furcifer
   lateralis, which is endemic to Madagascar and exported in large numbers
   for the pet trade. Cryptic speciation within F. lateralis was considered
   likely because this species (1) has a vast distribution, (2) occupies
   exceptionally diverse habitats and (3) exhibits subtle regional
   differences in morphology. Phylogenetic trees reconstructed using
   nuclear and mitochondrial genes recovered three well-supported clades
   corresponding with geography. Morphological results based on canonical
   variates analysis show that these clades exhibit subtle differences in
   head casque morphology. Ecological niche modelling results found that
   these phylogenetic groups also occupy unique environmental space and
   exhibit patterns of regional endemism typical of other endemic reptiles.
   Combined, our findings provide diverse yet consistent evidence for the
   existence of three species. Consequently, we elevate the subspecies F.
   lateralis major to species rank and name a new species distributed in
   northern and western Madagascar. Initial ecological divergence,
   associated with speciation of F. lateralis in humid eastern habitat,
   fits the Ecographic Constraint model for species diversification in
   Madagascar. By contrast, the second speciation event provides some
   support for the Riverine Barrier model, with the Mangoky River possibly
   causing initial isolation between species. These findings thus support
   two contrasting models of speciation within closely related species and
   demonstrate the utility of applying a combined-evidence approach for
   detecting cryptic speciation.},

Abstract = {The specialized grasping feet of primates, and in particular the nature
   of the hallucal grasping capabilities of living strepsirrhines and
   tarsiers (i.e., `prosimians'), have played central roles in the study of
   primate origins. Prior comparative studies of first metatarsal (Mt1)
   morphology have documented specialized characters in living prosimians
   that are indicative of a more abducted hallux, which in turn is often
   inferred to be related to an increased ability for powerful grasping.
   These include a well-developed peroneal process and a greater angle of
   the proximal articular surface relative to the long axis of the
   diaphysis. Although known Mt1s of fossil prosimians share these
   characters with living non-anthropoid primates, Mt1 morphology in the
   earliest crown group anthropoids is not well known. Here we describe two
   Mt1s from the Fayum Depression of Egypt - one from the latest Eocene
   (from the similar to 34 Ma Quarry L-41), and one from the later early
   Oligocene (from the similar to 29-30 Ma Quarry M) - and compare them
   with a sample of extant and fossil primate Mt1s. Multivariate analyses
   of Mt1 shape variables indicate that the Fayum specimens are most
   similar to those of crown group anthropoids, and likely belong to the
   stem catarrhines Catopithecus and Aegyptopithecus specifically, based on
   analyses of size. Also, phylogenetic analyses with 16 newly defined Mt1
   characters support the hypotheses that ``prosimian{''}-like Mt1 features
   evolved along the primate stem lineage, while crown anthropoid Mt1
   morphology and function is derived among primates, and likely differed
   from that of basal stem anthropoids. The derived loss of powerful
   hallucal grasping as reflected in the Mt1 morphology of crown
   anthropoids may reflect long-term selection for improved navigation of
   large-diameter, more horizontal branches at the expense of movement in
   smaller, more variably inclined branches in the arboreal environment.

   494-499. We report alopecic syndrome (hair loss) in Rickett's big-footed
   bat Myotis ricketti (Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae), in Guilin, China,
   from June 2009 to Sept. 2010. The coat condition of bats was scored on a
   3-point scale: AS0 (normal), AS5 (sparse hair), and AS10 (alopecia).
   Abnormal hair patterns were observed between early June and late Sept.
   when fresh hair again covered the abnormal region. The prevalence of
   alopecic syndrome varied in relation to age and sex, and reached a peak
   in late June. Adult females showed significantly higher incidences of
   prevalence of alopecic syndrome (90.9\%) than adult males (55.3\%)
   (chi(2) = 23.0, d.f. = 1, p < 0.01) from June to Aug. However, in
   immature bats, alopecia patterns were not observed in either sex, and
   only a sparse (AS5) hair condition occurred. No difference in the
   incidence of the condition was noted between males (51.5\%) and females
   (60.0\%) (chi(2) = 0.8, d.f. = 1, p > 0.01) from July to Aug. There was
   a significant difference between adults and juveniles (age) in the scale
   of occurrence of alopecia, and also its prevalence (chi(2) = 11.4, d.f.
   = 1, p < 0.01). We propose that parasitism, androgens, anthropogenic
   activities, or a combination of these factors might account for age and
   sexual differences in alopecia.

Abstract = {The current stage of railway transportation systems must deal with
   increased safety and reliability issues. A key point is improving
   occupancy track circuit performance and providing them with redundancy,
   higher noise immunity, and the capability to acquire additional
   information about the track section involved. This work proposes a novel
   track circuit based on the encoding of the electrical transmissions with
   Kasami codes. Track circuit emitters send signals coded with a known
   sequence that can be identified by the corresponding receivers using
   correlation techniques; these processes increase immunity to noise and
   changes in environmental conditions. An appropriate selection of
   orthogonal sequences for encoding, as well as different carrier
   frequencies for transmissions, allow simultaneous emissions and
   receptions without cross interference.},

Abstract = {We lack a general understanding of how primates perform physiologically
   during feeding to cope with the challenges of their natural
   environments. We here discuss several methods for studying the
   ecological physiology of feeding in mantled howlers (Alouatta palliata)
   at La Pacifica, Costa Rica. Our initial physiological effort focuses on
   recording electromyographic activity (EMG) from the jaw muscles in
   free-ranging howlers while they feed in their natural forest habitat. We
   integrate these EMG data with measurements of food material properties,
   dental wear rates, as well as spatial analyses of resource use and food
   distribution. Future work will focus on incorporating physiological
   measures of bone deformation, i.e., bone strain; temperatures; food
   nutritional data; and hormonal analyses. Collectively, these efforts
   will help us to better understand the challenges that howlers face in
   their environment and the physiological mechanisms they employ during
   feeding. Our initial efforts provide a proof of concept demonstrating
   the methodological feasibility of studying the physiology of feeding in
   free-ranging primates. Although howlers offer certain advantages to in
   vivo field research, many of the approaches described here can be
   applied to other primates in natural habitats. By collecting
   physiological data simultaneously with ecological and behavioral data,
   we will promote a more synthetic understanding of primate feeding and
   its evolutionary history.},

Title = {Sexual Signalling in Propithecus verreauxi: Male ``Chest Badge{''} and
   Female Mate Choice},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Communication, an essential prerequisite for sociality, involves the
   transmission of signals. A signal can be defined as any action or trait
   produced by one animal, the sender, that produces a change in the
   behaviour of another animal, the receiver. Secondary sexual signals are
   often used for mate choice because they may inform on a potential
   partner's quality. Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) is
   characterized by the presence of two different morphs of males
   (bimorphism), which can show either a stained or clean chest. The chest
   becomes stained by secretions of the sternal gland during throat marking
   (rubbing throat and chest on a vertical substrate while smearing the
   scent deposition). The role of the chest staining in guiding female mate
   choice was previously hypothesized but never demonstrated probably due
   to the difficulty of observing sifaka copulations in the wild. Here we
   report that stained-chested males had a higher throat marking activity
   than clean-chested males during the mating season, but not during the
   birth season. We found that females copulated more frequently with
   stained-chested males than the clean-chested males. Finally, in
   agreement with the biological market theory, we found that clean-chested
   males, with a lower scent-releasing potential, offered more grooming to
   females. This ``grooming for sex{''} tactic was not completely
   unsuccessful; in fact, half of the clean-chested males copulated with
   females, even though at low frequency. In conclusion, the chest stain,
   possibly correlated with different cues targeted by females, could be
   one of the parameters which help females in selecting mates.},

Abstract = {The effect of moonlight and temperature on activity of slow lorises was
   previously little known and this knowledge might be useful for
   understanding many aspects of their behavioural ecology, and developing
   strategies to monitor and protect populations. In this study we aimed to
   determine if the activity of the pygmy loris (Nycticebus pygmaeus) is
   affected by ambient temperature and/or moonlight in a mixed deciduous
   forest. We radio-collared five females and five males in the Seima
   Protection Forest, Cambodia, in February to May, 2008 and January to
   March, 2009 and recorded their behaviour at 5 minutes intervals,
   totalling 2736 observations. We classified each observation as either
   inactive (sleeping or alert) or active behaviour (travel, feeding,
   grooming, or others). Moon luminosity (bright/dark) and ambient
   temperature were recorded for each observation. The response variable,
   activity, was binary (active or inactive), and a logit link function was
   used. Ambient temperature alone did not significantly affect mean
   activity. Although mean activity was significantly affected by
   moonlight, the interaction between moonlight and temperature was also
   significant: on bright nights, studied animals were increasingly more
   active with higher temperature; and on dark nights they were
   consistently active regardless of temperature. The most plausible
   explanation is that on bright cold nights the combined risk of being
   seen and attacked by predators and heat loss outweigh the benefit of
   active behaviours.},

Abstract = {Expanding the repertoire of molecularly diverse neurons in the human
   nervous system is paramount to characterizing the neuronal networks that
   underpin sensory processing. Defining neuronal identities is
   particularly timely in the human olfactory system, whose structural
   differences from nonprimate macrosmatic species have recently gained
   momentum. Here, we identify clusters of bipolar neurons in a previously
   unknown outer ``shell{''} domain of the human olfactory tract, which
   express secretagogin, a cytosolic Ca2+ binding protein. These
   ``shell{''} neurons are wired into the olfactory circuitry because they
   can receive mixed synaptic inputs. Unexpectedly, secretagogin is often
   coexpressed with polysialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule,
   beta-III-tubulin, and calretinin, suggesting that these neurons
   represent a cell pool that might have escaped terminal differentiation
   into the olfactory circuitry. We hypothesized that
   secretagogin-containing ``shell{''} cells may be eliminated from the
   olfactory axis under neurodegenerative conditions. Indeed, the density,
   but not the morphological or neurochemical integrity, of
   secretagogin-positive neurons selectively decreases in the olfactory
   tract in Alzheimer's disease. In conclusion, secretagogin identifies a
   previously undescribed cell pool whose cytoarchitectonic arrangements
   and synaptic connectivity are poised to modulate olfactory processing in
   humans.},

Abstract = {Field studies of primate positional behavior typically rely on
   ground-level estimates of substrate size, angle, and canopy location.
   These estimates potentially influence the identification of positional
   modes by the observer recording behaviors. In this study we aim to test
   ground-level estimates against direct measurements of support angles,
   diameters, and canopy heights in trees at La Suerte Biological Research
   Station in Costa Rica. After reviewing methods that have been used by
   past researchers, we provide data collected within trees that are
   compared to estimates obtained from the ground. We climbed five trees
   and measured 20 supports. Four observers collected measurements of each
   support from different locations on the ground. Diameter estimates
   varied from the direct tree measures by 028 cm (Mean: 5.44 +/- 4.55).
   Substrate angles varied by 155 degrees (Mean: 14.76 +/- 14.02). Height
   in the tree was best estimated using a clinometer as estimates with a
   two-meter reference placed by the tree varied by 311 meters (Mean: 5.31
   +/- 2.44). We determined that the best support size estimates were those
   generated relative to the size of the focal animal and divided into
   broader categories. Support angles were best estimated in 5 degrees
   increments and then checked using a Haglof clinometer in combination
   with a laser pointer. We conclude that three major factors should be
   addressed when estimating support features: observer error (e.g.,
   experience and distance from the target), support deformity, and how
   support size and angle influence the positional mode selected by a
   primate individual. individual. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2012. (C) 2012

Abstract = {Since the introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act in 2002,
   companies have begun to place more emphasis on information technology
   (IT) internal controls. IT internal controls are policies that provide
   assurance that technical systems operate as intended, provide reliable
   data, and comply with regulations. Research suggests that firms with
   strong internal controls perform better than those with internal control
   weaknesses. In this study, the authors evaluate the impact of IT
   internal controls on firm performance. The sample includes 72 publicly
   traded firms, 36 that reported IT internal control weaknesses and 36
   that did not. The results of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
   indicate that substantive IT internal control weaknesses negatively
   impact firm performance. Results and implications for research and
   practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {Southern Madagascar is the core of a >1 million km(2) Gondwanan
   metasedimentary belt that forms much of the southern East African Orogen
   of eastern Africa, Madagascar, southern India and Sri Lanka. Here the
   Vohibory Series yielded U-Pb isotopic data from detrital zircon cores
   that indicate that it was deposited in the latest Tonian to late
   Cryogenian (between -900 and 640 Ma). The deposition of the Graphite and
   Androyen Series protoliths is poorly constrained to between the late
   Palaeoproterozoic and the Cambrian (similar to 1830-530 Ma). The
   Vohibory Series protoliths were sourced from very restricted-aged
   sources with a maximum age range between 910 and 760 Ma. The Androyen
   and Graphite Series protoliths were sourced from Palaeoproterozoic rocks
   ranging in age between 2300 and 1800 Ma. The best evidence of the timing
   of metamorphism in the Vohibory Series is a weighted mean Pb-206/U-238
   age of 642 +/- 8 Ma from 3 analyses of zircon from sample M03-01. A
   considerably younger Pb-206/U-238 metamorphic age of 531 +/- 7 Ma is
   produced from 10 analyses of zircon from sample M03-28 in the Androyen
   Series. This similar to 110 Ma difference in age is correlated with the
   early East African Orogeny affecting the west of Madagascar along with
   its type area in East Africa, whereas the Cambrian Malagasy Orogeny
   affected the east of Madagascar and southern India during the final
   suturing of the Mozambique Ocean. (C) 2011 International Association for

Abstract = {The capacity for cone-mediated color vision varies among nocturnal
   primates. Some species are colorblind, having lost the functionality of
   their short-wavelength-sensitive-1 (SWS1) opsin pigment gene. In other
   species, such as the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), the SWS1
   gene remains intact. Recent studies focused on aye-ayes indicate that
   this gene has been maintained by natural selection and that the pigment
   has a peak sensitivity (lambda(max)) of 406 nm, which is similar to 20
   nm closer to the ultraviolet region of the spectrum than in most
   primates. The functional significance behind the retention and unusual
   lambda(max) of this opsin pigment is unknown, and it is perplexing given
   that all mammals are presumed to be colorblind in the dark. Here we
   comment on this puzzle and discuss recent findings on the color vision
   intensity thresholds of terrestrial vertebrates with comparable optics
   to aye-ayes. We draw attention to the twilight activities of aye-ayes
   and report that twilight is enriched in short-wavelength (bluish) light.
   We also show that the intensity of twilight and full moonlight is
   probably sufficient to support cone-mediated color vision. We speculate
   that the intact SWS1 opsin pigment gene of aye-ayes is a crepuscular
   adaptation and we report on the blueness of potential visual targets,
   such as scent marks and the brilliant blue arils of Ravenala
   madagascariensis. Am. J. Primatol. 74: 185-192, 2012. (C) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {SAMHD1 has recently been identified as an HIV-1 restriction factor
   operating in myeloid cells. As a countermeasure, the Vpx accessory
   protein from HIV-2 and certain lineages of SIV have evolved to
   antagonize SAMHD1 by inducing its ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent
   degradation. Here, we show that SAMHD1 experienced strong positive
   selection episodes during primate evolution that occurred in the
   Catarrhini ancestral branch prior to the separation between hominoids
   (gibbons and great apes) and Old World monkeys. The identification of
   SAMHD1 residues under positive selection led to mapping the
   Vpx-interaction domain of SAMHD1 to its C-terminal region. Importantly,
   we found that while SAMHD1 restriction activity toward HIV-1 is
   evolutionarily maintained, antagonism of SAMHD1 by Vpx is
   species-specific. The distinct evolutionary signature of SAMHD1 sheds
   light on the development of its antiviral specificity.},

Abstract = {The documentation of enamel thickness variation across primates is
   important because enamel thickness has both taxonomic and functional
   relevance. The Old World monkeys commonly referred to as mangabeys have
   figured prominently in investigations of feeding ecology and enamel
   thickness. In this article, we report enamel thickness values for four
   mangabey taxa (Cercocebus atys, Cercocebus torquatus, Lophocebus
   aterrimus, and Lophocebus albigena), offer revised interpretation of the
   significance of thick enamel in papionin evolution, and place our new
   data in a broader comparative framework. Our data indicate that all
   mangabeys have thick enamel and that the values obtained for Cercocebus
   and Lophocebus equal or exceed those published for most extant non-human
   primates. In addition, new field data combined with a current reading of
   the dietary literature indicate that hard foods make up a portion of the
   diet of every mangabey species sampled to date. Clarification on the
   relationship between diet and enamel thickness among mangabeys is
   important not only because of recognition that mangabeys are not a
   natural group but also because of recent arguments that explain thick
   enamel as an evolved response to the seasonal consumption of hard foods.

Abstract = {In many social animals, group-mates cooperate to defend their range
   against intrusion by neighboring groups. Because group size tends to be
   highly variable, such conflicts are often asymmetric. Although numerical
   superiority is assumed to provide a competitive advantage, small groups
   can generally defend their ranges, even when greatly outnumbered. The
   prevailing explanation for this puzzling phenomenon is that individuals
   in relatively large groups experience a greater temptation to flee from
   conflicts, in effect leveling the balance of power. Using playback
   experiments simulating territorial intrusions by wild capuchin monkey
   (Cebus capucinus) groups, we show that such a collective action problem
   does indeed undermine the competitive ability of large groups. Focal
   capuchins were more likely to run away from territorial intrusions when
   their group had a numeric advantage; each one-individual increase in
   relative group size raised the odds of flight by 25\%. However,
   interaction location had a more important impact on individuals'
   reactions, creating a strong home-field advantage. After controlling for
   relative group size, the odds that a focal animal fled were 91\% lower
   in experiments that occurred in the center compared with on the edge of
   its group's range, whereas the odds that it rushed toward the speaker
   were more than sixfold higher. These location-dependent patterns of
   defection and cooperation create a competitive advantage for residents
   over intruders across a wide range of relative group sizes, which may
   stabilize range boundaries and provide a general explanation for how
   groups of widely divergent sizes can coexist, even in the face of
   intense intergroup competition.},

   Antipredator Strategy?},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {83},
Number = {3-6},
Pages = {236-251},
Abstract = {The apparent paucity of accounts of predation, particularly by felids,
   on nocturnal primates is confirmed by a quasi-systematic review of 1,939
   publications which revealed just 1 case of a felid eating a nocturnal
   primate. This instance was amongst only 51 direct reports of predation
   by vertebrates on nocturnal primates (90\% were on Madagascar, where
   56\% of approx. 110 nocturnal primate species occur), of which 41\% were
   by birds of prey. These findings prompt discussion of two possibilities:
   (a) nocturnality is, in part, an effective antipredator adaptation, and
   (b) knowledge of nocturnal primates is so biased by their elusiveness
   and, for predation, underreporting (e.g. inadequate mechanisms to
   publish opportunistic observations) that understanding of their biology
   urgently necessitates both the collation of field observations and
   innovative research. Interspecific comparisons facilitate deductions
   about the role of predation in the evolution of primate nocturnality and
   associated traits, but intraspecific comparisons of changing activity
   rhythms in response to different levels of predation risk offer the most
   compelling insights into the functional significance of these
   adaptations. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {Most of the ancestors of today's human and animal populations reached
   Madagascar over the last 65 million years, by a variety of routes at a
   variety of times. Settlers encountered a big, isolated island with an
   unpredictable climate and a wide array of landscapes. Although patterns
   of diversification were driven by different mechanisms in humans and
   animals, the complex interplay between historical contingency and
   responsiveness to local conditions is evident in both.
   Global climate change will affect Madagascar, although exactly how
   remains unclear, and the immediate impact of human activity on the
   island is overtaking that of gradual global change. Three themes in this
   review bear on the future: the continuing impact of recent, cataclysmic
   events on modern communities of people, plants, and animals;
   Madagascar's long and dynamic environmental history; and the complicated
   history of how people settled and interacted with the island's
   landscapes. A deeper understanding of all three can contribute to wise
   decision making in the coming years.},

Title = {Chromosome Painting of the Pygmy Tree Shrew Shows that No Derived

Abstract = {We hybridized human chromosome paints on metaphases of the pygmy tree
   shrew (Tupaia minor, Scandentia). The lack of the ancestral mammalian
   4/8 association in both Primates and Scandentia was long considered a
   cytogenetic land-mark that phylogenetically linked these mammalian
   orders. However, our results show that the association 4/8 is present in
   Tupaia along with not previously reported associations for 1/18 and
   7/10. Altogether there are 11 syntenic associations of human chromosome
   segments in the pygmy tree shrew karyotype: 1/18, 2/21, 3/21, 4/8, 7/10,
   7/16, 11/20, 12/22 (twice), 14/15 and 16/19. Our data remove any
   cytogenetic evidence that Scandentia has a preferential phylogenetic
   relationship with Primates. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Title = {Seasonal Variation of Temporal Niche in Wild Owl Monkeys (Aotus azarai
   azarai) of the Argentinean Chaco: A Matter of Masking?},
Journal = {CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {29},
Number = {6},
Pages = {702-714},
Abstract = {Among the more than 40 genera of anthropoid primates (monkeys, apes, and
   humans), only the South American owl monkeys, genus Aotus, are
   nocturnal. However, the southernmostly distributed species, Aotus azarai
   azarai, of the Gran Chaco may show considerable amounts of its 24-h
   activity during bright daylight. Due to seasonal changes in the duration
   of photophase and climatic parameters in their subtropical habitat, the
   timing and pattern of their daily activity are expected to show
   significant seasonal variation. By quantitative long-term activity
   recordings with Actiwatch AW4 accelerometer data logger devices of 10
   wild owl monkeys inhabiting a gallery forest in Formosa, Argentina, the
   authors analyzed the seasonal variation in the temporal niche and
   activity pattern resulting from entrainment and masking of the circadian
   activity rhythm by seasonally and diurnally varying environmental
   factors. The owl monkeys always displayed a distinct bimodal activity
   pattern, with prominent activity bouts and peaks during dusk and dawn.
   Their activity rhythm showed distinct lunar and seasonal variations in
   the timing and daily pattern. During the summer, the monkeys showed
   predominantly crepuscular/nocturnal behavior, and a
   crepuscular/cathemeral activity pattern with similar diurnal and
   nocturnal activity levels during the cold winter months. The peak times
   of the evening and morning activity bouts were more closely related to
   the times of sunset and sunrise, respectively, than activity-onset and
   -offset. Obviously, they were better circadian markers for the phase
   position of the entrained activity rhythm than activity-onset and
   -offset, which were subject to more masking effects of environmental
   and/or internal factors. Total daily activity was lowest during the two
   coldest lunar months, and almost twice as high during the warmest
   months. Nighttime (21:00-06:00 h) and daytime (09:00-18:00 h) activity
   varied significantly across the year, but in an opposite manner. Highest
   nighttime activity occurred in summer and maximal daytime activity
   during the cold winter months. Dusk and dawn activity, which together
   accounted for 43\% of the total daily activity, barely changed. The
   monkeys tended to terminate their nightly activity period earlier on
   warm and rainy days, whereas the daily amount of activity showed no
   significant correlation either with temperature or precipitation. These
   data are consistent with the dual-oscillator hypothesis of circadian
   regulation. They suggest the seasonal variations of the timing and
   pattern of daily activity in wild owl monkeys of the Argentinean Chaco
   result from a specific interplay of light entrainment of circadian
   rhythmicity and strong masking effects of various endogenous and
   environmental factors. Since the phase position of the monkeys' evening
   and morning activity peaks did not vary considerably over the year, the
   seasonal change from a crepuscular/nocturnal activity pattern in summer
   to a more crepuscular/cathemeral one in winter does not depend on a
   corresponding phase shift of the entrained circadian rhythm, but mainly
   on masking effects. Thermoregulatory and energetic demands and
   constraints seem to play a crucial role. (Author correspondence:

Title = {Bite marks revisited - evidence for middle-to-late Eocene Basilosaurus
   isis predation on Dorudon atrox (both Cetacea, Basilosauridae)},
Journal = {PALAEONTOLOGIA ELECTRONICA},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Basilosauridae are cosmopolitan fully-aquatic archaeocete whales,
   represented by larger Basilosaurus isis and smaller Dorudon atrox in the
   middle-to-late Eocene Gehannam and Birket Qarun Formations of Egypt (ca.
   38-36.5 Ma). Adult and juvenile Dorudon but only adult Basilosaurus are
   found in these shallow-marine deposits. Lethal bite marks on juvenile
   Dorudon skulls sparked the idea that adult Basilosaurus invaded calving
   grounds of D. atrox to prey on their young. However, there has been no
   direct evidence to support this idea. In this study, bite marks on
   specimens of juvenile D. atrox that have previously been described but
   not assigned to a particular trace-maker are reinvestigated, and
   additional bone modifications are analyzed. Applying computed tomography
   (CT), digital surface scanning, and three-dimensional (3D)
   reconstruction, the juvenile D. atrox specimens were digitally placed
   into the mouth of an adult B. isis. Bite marks match the dentition of B.
   isis. Imprints of tooth casts of B. isis in modeling clay furthermore
   resemble bite marks on these D. atrox specimens in shape and size. B.
   isis was likely a predator that included juvenile D. atrox in its diet.
   Prey was predominantly captured from a lateral position across the head
   and sometimes adjusted in the mouth prior to a more powerful bite.
   Scavenging of B. isis on D. atrox calves is also possible. The diet of
   Basilosaurus and dietary differences within the genus resemble those
   known in modern killer whales (Orcinus orca). B. isis is the only
   archaeocete known to date that possibly preyed on other cetaceans.},

Abstract = {In this paper we explore the design space of tails intended for
   self-righting a robot's body during free fall.Conservation of total
   angular momentum imposes a dimensionless index of rotational efficacy
   upon the robot's kinematic and dynamical parameters whose selection
   insures that for a given tail rotation,the body rotation will be
   identical at any size scale.In contrast,the duration of such a body
   reorientation depends upon the acceleration of the tail relative to the
   body,and power density of the tail's actuator must increase with size in
   order to achieve the same maneuver in the same relative time.Assuming a
   simple controller and power-limited actuator,we consider maneuverability
   constraints upon two different types of parameters morphological and
   energetic that can be used for design.We show how these constraints
   inform contrasting tail design on two robots separated by a four-fold
   length scale,the177g Tailbot and the 8.1kg X-RHex Lite (XRL).We compare
   previously published empirical self-righting behavior of the Tailbot
   with new,tailed XRL experiments wherein we drop it nose first from a 2.7
   body length height and also deliberately run it off an elevated cliff to
   land safely on its springy legs in both cases.},

Abstract = {Given that something as fundamental as food acquisition is subject to
   selection pressure, it follows that morphological and behavioral
   diversity among primates is reflective of a range of adaptations to
   diet, feeding, and foraging. The recognition of these adaptations,
   however, is operationally difficult because it is the interaction
   between morphological and ecological variables that serves to define the
   particular adaptation. Researchers have addressed this problem of
   recognition of adaptation by integrating functional and biomechanical
   measures of morphological performance with observations of foraging and
   feeding behavior of primates in natural habitats. These disparate
   approaches traditionally resided in separate laboratory and field
   domains, but technological and analytical advances have blurred the
   distinction between them. The success with which this integration of
   approaches has elucidated the nature of primate foraging adaptations is
   reviewed with respect to (a) ingestive strategies, (b) locomotor
   diversity, (c) hard-object feeding in papionin primates, and (d) the
   influence of ``fallback foods{''} on behavior and morphology.},

Abstract = {The implementation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
   in the public sector has the potential to produce countless benefits.
   Government administrators are aggressively seeking ways to enhance the
   development and implementation of more effective and efficient
   government services. One electronic government initiative that has
   rapidly grown in importance and popularity is electronic tax filing.
   Every year, United States (U.S) citizens flock to e-file vendors to
   submit their taxes in hopes of a quicker, simpler, less painful process.
   The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the e-file vendors are jointly
   interested in retaining existing users, because citizens' outright
   adoption and continuous consumption of the associated products and
   services is critical to long-term success. Thus, continuous use of
   e-file by citizens is of supreme importance to the IRS as well as
   customer retention is of the utmost importance to vendors. Thus this
   topic is of research interest, both theoretically and practically. This
   study explores the factors that contribute to e-file adoption.
   Specifically, we develop a research model with a theoretical foundation
   coming from several theories of commitment to understand how and
   individual's decision to continue to use a website is influenced by
   their commitment towards e-file and the vendor that supports it. Results
   of a multiple linear regression analysis derived from data collected
   from 249 U.S. taxpayers and users of a variety of e-file vendors
   indicate that affective commitment, quality of alternatives, and trust
   were significantly associated with an individual's behavioral intention
   to e-file. The proposed model explains over seventy percent of the
   variance in a citizen's intention to re-use an e-file service.
   Implications for citizen/customer retention and decision-making
   strategies are discussed.},

Abstract = {The majority of previous publications have suggested that the
   large-bodied subfossil Protopithecus brasiliensis was a suspensory
   ateline with a locomotor repertoire similar to that of extant Ateles and
   Brachyteles. This is unexpected, as the cranial morphology of
   Protopithecus is very similar to Alouatta, a genus usually classified as
   a deliberate quadrupedal climber. Complicating matters further, as
   Protopithecus is twice as large as Ateles and Brachyteles, its ability
   to be as suspensory as those two genera is suspect and a terrestrial
   component of the locomotor repertoire has also been hypothesized. The
   forelimbs of Protopithecus, while relatively elongated as would be
   expected in a suspensory animal, are also quite robust and show several
   adaptations for climbing. To test these hypotheses about the fossil
   locomotor repertoire, three-dimensional geometric morphometric
   techniques were used to quantify the shapes of the fossil distal humerus
   and proximal ulna and then compare them to a broad sample of extant
   primates with varying body sizes and locomotor patterns. Results
   indicate that Protopithecus is similar to Ateles and Brachyteles in
   terms of its forelimb joint surface morphology; however, the overall
   locomotor repertoire of the fossil is reconstructed as more flexible to
   include forelimb suspension, climbing, and potentially some terrestrial
   ground use. The combination of suspensory locomotion and quadrupedal
   climbing supported here indicates the beginnings of the evolutionary
   transition from a more acrobatic style of locomotion in the last common
   ancestor of alouattins and atelins to the current pattern of howler
   locomotion. Anat Rec, , 2011. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {In this study we examined the allometry of basal metabolic rate (BMR) of
   31 parrot species. Unlike previous reports, we show that parrots per se
   do not display BMRs that are any different to other captive-raised birds
   of their body size. An ordinary least squares regression fitted the data
   best and body mass explained 95\% of the variation in BMR. There was no
   phylogenetic signal in the BMR data. We also provide new data for the
   Greater Vasa Parrot (Coracopsis vasa) of Madagascar. We tested the
   hypotheses that C. vasa may, because of its insular existence, display
   conservative energetic traits (low BMR, use of adaptive heterothermy)
   similar to those observed in several Malagasy mammals. However, this was
   not the case. C. vasa had a higher BMR than other parrots, especially
   during summer, when BMR was up-regulated by 50.5\% and was 95.7\% higher
   than predicted from an ordinary least squares (OLS) allometry of parrots
   (BMR = 0.042M (b) (0.649) , BMR in Watts, M (b) in grammes). Compared
   with BMR data for 94 captive-raised bird species, the winter and summer
   BMRs were, respectively, 45.5 and 117.8\% higher than predicted by a
   phylogenetic generalised least squares (PGLS) allometry (BMR = 0.030M
   (b) (0.687) , BMR in Watts, M (b) in grammes). The summer up-regulation
   of BMR is the highest recorded for a bird of any size to date. We
   suggest that the costs of a high summer BMR may be met by the unusual
   cooperative breeding system of C. vasa in which groups of males feed the
   female and share paternity. The potential breeding benefits of a high
   summer BMR are unknown.},

Abstract = {Cruaud, A., Raherilalao, M. J., Pasquet, E. \& Goodman, S. M. (2011)
   Phylogeography and systematics of the Malagasy rock-thrushes
   (Muscicapidae, Monticola). -Zoologica Scripta, 40, 554-566.
   The patterns of genetic variation and the systematics of members of the
   widespread Old World genus Monticola (Family Muscicapidae) occurring on
   Madagascar remain unresolved. Herein, we address these questions by
   examining the phylogeography of Malagasy Monticola using two molecular
   markers (ND2 and ATP6, 1.5 kb) from 60 individuals sampled across their
   known range. To clarify the relationships within the clade groupings, we
   use a statistical haplotype network and an analysis of the genetic
   structure of the different populations sampled. A morphological study
   was conducted in parallel that used many of the same individuals
   employed in the molecular study to examine potential differences between
   the recovered clades. Based on molecular genetics and morphology, M.
   imerinus is distinct from the M. sharpei complex, which is composed of
   five phylogroups: Group A (Central Highlands, typical sharpei), Group B
   (Central West, Bemaraha), Group C (Northern Highlands), Group D
   (Montagne d'Ambre, erythronotus) and Group E (Southwestern, bensoni).
   While molecular data show high levels of geographical structure, these
   differences exhibit low levels of intergroup genetic divergence
   (0.01-0.07\%). We suggest that two species of Monticola occur on
   Madagascar, imerinus and sharpei, and the forms referable to bensoni and
   erythronotus, as well as unnamed populations from the Central West
   (Bemahara), should be considered as part of M. sharpei and are
   populations that are probably isolated and undergoing incipient
   speciation.},

Title = {Hair cortisol levels track phylogenetic and age related differences in
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity in non-human primates},
Journal = {GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {174},

Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Hair has been shown to archive a uniquely time averaged signal of
   endocrine activity, and holds attractive advantages for both laboratory
   and field research. Prior research has explored the potential of hair
   hormone analysis to examine hormone-behavior relationships. To date, no
   research has focused on the potential of the technique to investigate
   age-related changes or taxon differences in endocrine function. It is
   known that non-human primate infants of many taxa exhibit high cortisol
   levels after parturition, which rapidly decline with age. It has also
   been shown that hypercortisolism generally characterizes platyrrhine
   (New World monkey) endocrine function. These endocrine trends have been
   characterized using cortisol levels determined from serum, plasma, and
   feces. Here we test whether cortisol levels determined from hair recover
   similar phylogenetic and age related patterns in endocrine function in
   non-human primates. In order to test whether hair cortisol reflect
   infant hypercortisolism with significant age-related decline, hair
   cortisol levels are measured in samples from wild vervet monkeys
   (Chlorocebus aethiops) and captive Guinea baboons (Papio hamadryas
   papio), ranging in age from infants through juveniles. Further, in order
   to test whether platyrrhines exhibit significantly higher hair cortisol
   levels compared to strepsirrhines and catarrhines, and therefore
   faithfully recover similar signals as more traditionally used substrates
   (e.g. serum), hair cortisol levels are quantified in adult female hair
   samples collected from a broad range of non-human primate taxa. Results
   confirm that hair cortisol levels accurately reflect known phylogenetic
   and age related patterns of circulating cortisol levels. Therefore,
   these results suggest that hair may be an ideal hormone bearing
   substrate for research focused on the examination of population
   endocrine profiles, cross-sectional studies of endocrine function and
   taxon variation in hormone levels, as well as stable behavioral trends.

Abstract = {In this article, a time-of-flight detection technique in the frequency
   domain is described for an ultrasonic Local Positioning System (LPS)
   based on encoded beacons. Beacon transmissions have been synchronized
   and become simultaneous by means of the DS-CDMA (Direct-Sequence Code
   Division Multiple Access) technique. Every beacon has been associated to
   a 255-bit Kasami code. The detection of signal arrival instant at the
   receiver, from which the distance to each beacon can be obtained, is
   based on the application of the Generalized Cross-Correlation (GCC), by
   using the cross-spectral density between the received signal and the
   sequence to be detected. Prior filtering to enhance the frequency
   components around the carrier frequency (40 kHz) has improved
   estimations when obtaining the correlation function maximum, which
   implies an improvement in distance measurement precision. Positioning
   has been achieved by using hyperbolic trilateration, based on the Time
   Differences of Arrival (TDOA) between a reference beacon and the others.},

Abstract = {The notion that an animal species is comparable with a human person is
   unusual but significant in North Atlantic societies. We analyze this
   trope to make a case for rhetoric culture theory as a powerful form of
   anthropological analysis. The ``species is person{''} trope has been
   woven with other tropes to make moral and cosmological arguments in the
   present geosocial era of environmental crisis. The trope stands against
   two others in North Atlantic societies, tropes that are themselves at
   odds: (1) other animal species are not persons but are means to our
   ends, and (2) each individual animal of a species is equivalent to an
   individual human person and so are ends in themselves. The ``species is
   person{''} trope has been used to evoke the characteristically North
   Atlantic notion of sacred personhood to support action on behalf of
   human-distant species such as river-dwelling mollusks, species that

   both to alter understandings and to initiate commitments to action
   demonstrates its effectiveness as reasoning but also the importance of
   this style of analysis.},

Abstract = {We describe Calumma vohibola sp. nov., a morphologically distinct
   chameleon species of the Calumma nasutum species group from littoral
   forest fragments of the north-central east coast of Madagascar. Males
   and females of this species differ from all other species of the Calumma
   nasutum group by an almost absent rostral appendage, by a characteristic
   stress colouration in the female consisting of a dark reddish ground
   colouration with many irregular light blue spots, and by significant
   sequence divergence in the mitochondrial ND2 gene (10.5-19.4\% pairwise
   distance) and no haplotype sharing in the nuclear C-mos gene compared
   with other members of the C. nasutum group. A molecular survey of C.
   nasutum populations occurring near the type locality of the new species
   reveals an extraordinarily high genetic diversity within this
   morphologically conservative chameleon group. We suspect that C.
   vohibola might be restricted to a rather small and fragmented
   distribution range within the last littoral forest fragments along the
   coast. Owing to the unsolved taxonomic situation of the C. nasutum
   group, no reliable distribution data of any member of this group are
   available at present, and hence we cannot ascertain whether the extent
   of occurrence of C. vohibola is indeed as restricted as suspected.
   Intensive surveys and field studies are necessary to clarify the
   distribution limits of this new species and to assess its conservation
   status reliably.},

   integrator to generate the sequence of spikes whose density is
   proportional to the amplitude of the echo. The sensor is used to
   generate rotational scans of a post covered with different fabrics at
   six different frequencies. Principal component analysis applied to the
   number of spikes obtained at different bearings and frequencies
   generates datasets that are clearly separated for each material, thus
   facilitating their latter identification by means of a probabilistic

   Predicting the Location of Productive Fossil Localities},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},

Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Chance and serendipity have long played a role in the location of
   productive fossil localities by vertebrate paleontologists and
   paleoanthropologists. We offer an alternative approach, informed by
   methods borrowed from the geographic information sciences and using
   recent advances in computer science, to more efficiently predict where
   fossil localities might be found. Our model uses an artificial neural
   network (ANN) that is trained to recognize the spectral characteristics
   of known productive localities and other land cover classes, such as
   forest, wet-lands, and scrubland, within a study area based on the
   analysis of remotely sensed (RS) imagery. Using these spectral
   signatures, the model then classifies other pixels throughout the study
   area. The results of the neural network classification can be examined
   and further manipulated within a geographic information systems (GIS)
   software package. While we have developed and tested this model on
   fossil mammal localities in deposits of Paleocene and Eocene age in the
   Great Divide Basin of southwestern Wyoming, a similar analytical
   approach can be easily applied to fossil-bearing sedimentary deposits of
   any age in any part of the world. We suggest that new analytical tools
   and methods of the geographic sciences, including remote sensing and
   geographic information systems, are poised to greatly enrich
   paleoanthropological investigations, and that these new methods should
   be embraced by field workers in the search for, and geospatial analysis
   of, fossil primates and hominins.},

Title = {Social Behavior, Foraging Strategies, and Fecal Glucocorticoids in
   Female Blue Monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis): Potential Fitness Benefits of
   High Rank in a Forest Guenon},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {73},
Number = {9},
Pages = {870-882},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Socioecological theory predicts that aggressive feeding competition is
   associated with linear dominance hierarchies and reproductive advantages
   for high-ranking females. Female blue monkeys contest fruits and have a
   linear dominance hierarchy, yet previous research has shown no evidence
   that high-ranking females benefit from greater feeding success or
   fertility. Here, we assess whether individuals differ in fecal
   glucocorticoid (fGC) excretion and examine proximate determinants of
   such differences to infer potential fitness correlates of rank, using
   data collected from two study groups in the Kakamega Forest, Kenya. We
   found that higher ranking females had preferential access to fruits in
   both groups, although the behavioral mechanisms leading to this effect
   varied between groups. Despite a consistent rank difference in feeding
   on fruits, an overall rank effect on fGCs emerged in only one group;
   females of this group spent comparatively more time feeding on fruits,
   fruits accounted for a greater proportion of the diet, and females
   engaged in more frequent food-related agonism. In addition, more females
   in this group were lactating during a period of low fruit availability,
   when rank effects on fGCs were particularly strong. Regardless of fruit
   availability, among lactating females of both groups higher rank was
   associated with lower fGC levels, indicating lower energetic stress in
   higher ranking females when energy demands were particularly high.
   Individual rates of agonism, a potential psychological stressor, were
   unrelated to fGCs at all times. After we accounted for rates of agonism
   and feeding on fruits, females of one group who groomed others more had
   lower fGCs, suggesting that variable social coping behavior can
   contribute to fGC variation in some groups. This study provides the
   first empirical evidence that high-ranking female blue monkeys may
   obtain fitness benefits from their social status, by gaining priority of
   access to fruits during critical times in the reproductive cycle. Am. J.

Abstract = {Among other things, sexual selection theory posits that in species with
   limited male parental investment, males should evolve biological
   mechanisms to competitively dominate or otherwise compete with one
   another. It is unclear whether such proposed mechanisms would influence
   status hierarchies in small human groups. We report the results of a
   study investigating possible effects of prenatal (index-to-ring finger
   length ratio or 2D:4D) and salivary testosterone, and masculine
   identification, on status among 71 male college students living in nine
   residential groups. The results indicate no role of either prenatal or
   salivary testosterone in maintaining status hierarchies in these groups.
   A possible explanation is that peer-assessed status in these groups was
   arrived at cooperatively rather than through dominance contests. (C)

Title = {Heterothermy in Afrotropical Mammals and Birds: A Review},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the number of Afrotropical
   endotherms known to avoid mismatches between energy supply and demand by
   using daily torpor and/or hibernation. Among mammals, heterothermy has
   been reported in 40 species in six orders, namely Macroscelidea,
   Afrosoricida, Rodentia, Eulipotyphla, Primates and Chiroptera. These
   species span a range in body mass of 7-770 g, with minimum heterothermic
   body temperatures ranging from 1-27 degrees C and bout length varying
   from 1 h to 70 days. Daily torpor is the most common form of
   heterothermy, with true hibernation being observed in only seven
   species, Graphiurus murinus, Graphiurus ocularis, Atelerix frontalis,
   Cheirogaleus medius, Cheirogaleus major, Microcebus murinus and
   Microcebus griseorufus. The traditional distinction between daily torpor
   and hibernation is blurred in some species, with free-ranging
   individuals exhibiting bouts of > 24 h and body temperatures < 16
   degrees C, but none of the classical behaviours associated with
   hibernation. Several species bask in the sun during rewarming. Among
   birds, heterothermy has been reported in 16 species in seven orders, and
   is more pronounced in phylogenetically older taxa. Both in mammals and
   birds, patterns of heterothermy can vary dramatically among species
   occurring at a particular site, and even among individuals of a single
   species. For instance, patterns of heterothermy among cheirogalid
   primates in western Madagascar vary from daily torpor to uninterrupted
   hibernation for up to seven months. Other examples of variation among
   closely-related species involve small owls, elephant shrews and
   vespertilionid bats. There may also be variation in terms of the
   ecological correlates of torpor within a species, as is the case in the
   Freckled Nightjar Caprimulgus tristigma.},

Abstract = {According to qualitative descriptions, proboscis monkeys have high
   frequency vocalizations, but no technical analysis of the calls is
   available because the species is rare, difficult to study in the field,
   and few zoological institutions have breeding populations. Here we
   analyse the high pitch vocalizations of captive proboscis monkeys in the
   Singapore Zoological Gardens. The monkeys produce very high frequency
   tonal vocalizations ranging from 1.4 kHz to 6.8 kHz. The calls are
   produced during acts of aggression or used as alarm calls and the pitch
   is higher than expected based on a comparative study for such a large
   primate. We discuss that the high frequency may be an adaptation for
   predator avoidance (crocodiles) and/or communication in dense
   vegetation.},

Abstract = {This study presents a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture
   utilising polarisation diversity to increase the capacity of
   high-frequency (HF) radio links through the ionospheric channel. A
   summary of physics focuses on the polarisation of radio waves propagated
   in the ionosphere. This preliminary step introduces the original idea of
   diversity in the transmitted polarisations to replace the classical
   space diversity for MIMO applications. This solution enables a reduction
   of the inter antenna spacing which is convenient in the context of
   decametric wavelengths. Simulations, referring to the theoretical
   expression of channel capacity and involving realistic models of
   ionospheric radio links, underline a significant increase in
   performances for this particular MIMO structure if compared to a
   single-input single-output system. Additionally, the trade-off between
   capacity gain and complexity appears balanced with the development of a
   2 x N MIMO system transmitting two complementary circular polarisations.
   More specifically, the design of a 2 x 2 MIMO system is described in the
   context of a single carrier waveform and frequency-domain equalisation,
   resorting to classical solutions for the different signal processing
   modules. A global simulation, involving the entire transmission system,
   is carried out and gives an estimate of the maximal data transfer rate
   compatible with a requested quality of service.},

Title = {The Equivocal Relationship Between Territoriality and Scent Marking in
   Wild Saddleback Tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {974-991},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Researchers have often assumed that scent marking serves a territorial
   function in callitrichines, although some controversy exists. To fulfill
   such a function, scent marks should 1) prevent intrusions, 2) ensure
   access to feeding resources, 3) enable avoidance of intergroup
   encounters, or 4) play an important role in the aggressive encounters
   between groups. We studied 13 saddleback tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis)
   belonging to 3 free-ranging groups, which formed mixed-species troops
   with moustached tamarins (S. mystax) in the Amazonian rain forest of
   Peru. None of the predictions were confirmed. The tamarins used a
   border-marking strategy, marking more on the periphery of their
   territory. However, feeding trees in overlap and encounter areas
   received more scent marking but were still visited by neighboring
   groups. Intergroup encounters occurred more often than expected, and
   scent-marking frequency was not higher during them than when no other
   group was present. It appears that instead of defending a territory in
   the classic sense, the tamarins are optimizing signal transmission by
   depositing their scents where the probability of detection by neighbors
   is higher. Saddleback tamarins may use shared areas of their home ranges
   to exchange information with neighboring groups, perhaps regarding
   reproductive opportunities.},

Title = {Male-Mediated Gene Flow in Patrilocal Primates},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Background: Many group-living species display strong sex biases in
   dispersal tendencies. However, gene flow mediated by apparently
   philopatric sex may still occur and potentially alters population
   structure. In our closest living evolutionary relatives, dispersal of
   adult males seems to be precluded by high levels of territoriality
   between males of different groups in chimpanzees, and has only been
   observed once in bonobos. Still, male-mediated gene flow might occur
   through rare events such as extra-group matings leading to extra-group
   paternity (EGP) and female secondary dispersal with offspring, but the
   extent of this gene flow has not yet been assessed.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Using autosomal microsatellite
   genotyping of samples from multiple groups of wild western chimpanzees
   (Pan troglodytes verus) and bonobos (Pan paniscus), we found low genetic
   differentiation among groups for both males and females.
   Characterization of Y-chromosome microsatellites revealed levels of
   genetic differentiation between groups in bonobos almost as high as
   those reported previously in eastern chimpanzees, but lower levels of
   differentiation in western chimpanzees. By using simulations to evaluate
   the patterns of Y-chromosomal variation expected under realistic
   assumptions of group size, mutation rate and reproductive skew, we
   demonstrate that the observed presence of multiple and highly divergent
   Y-haplotypes within western chimpanzee and bonobo groups is best
   explained by successful male-mediated gene flow.
   Conclusions/Significance: The similarity of inferred rates of
   male-mediated gene flow and published rates of EGP in western
   chimpanzees suggests this is the most likely mechanism of male-mediated
   gene flow in this subspecies. In bonobos more data are needed to refine
   the estimated rate of gene flow. Our findings suggest that dispersal
   patterns in these closely related species, and particularly for the
   chimpanzee subspecies, are more variable than previously appreciated.
   This is consistent with growing recognition of extensive behavioral
   variation in chimpanzees and bonobos.},

Title = {Interactions between adipose, bone, and muscle tissue markers during

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE AND PHYSICAL FITNESS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {51},

Pages = {347-354},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aim. The purpose of this investigation was to study the influence of
   prolonged low-intensity single scull rowing exercise on plasma
   adipocytokine and osteokine concentrations in trained male rowers. Nine
   single scull rowers (age: 20.1+/-1.6 yrs; height: 184.1+/-4.6 cm; body
   mass: 81.2+/-5.3 kg; \%body fat: 11.1+/-3.9) participated in this study.
   Methods. Venous blood samples were obtained before and after a similar
   to 2 h constant load on-water sculling training session (distance:
   20.6+/-1.5 km; HR: 133+/-4 bpm; intensity: 80.3+/-1.7\% of the HR
   turn-point).
   Results. The training session created an energy deficit of 1 200-1 500
   kcal. Plasma adiponectin increased (+12.2\%; P<0.05) while leptin
   decreased (-23.1\%; P<0.05) at 30 min postexercise. Plasma osteocalcin
   (+23.7\%; P<0.05) and type I carboxyterminal telopeptide (ICTP)
   (+28.6\%; P<0.05) were increased on completion of the training session.
   Plasma IL-6 concentration was increased (P<0.05) about four-fold while
   insulin concentration was decreased (P<0.05) more than three-fold upon
   completion of exercise. There were no differences in TNF-alpha, glucose,
   testosterone and cortisol concentrations over time. Plasma adiponectin
   (r=0.59) and osteocalcin (r=0.57) concentrations measured immediately
   after the training session were related (P<0.05) to the distance
   covered.
   Conclusion. Acute negative energy balance induced by a single endurance
   rowing training session elicited an inverse metabolic response in
   adiponectin and osteocalcin concentrations in male rowers. Our results
   suggest that peripheral markers of negative energy balance, such as
   adiponectin and osteocalcin, may serve as signals for metabolic reaction
   to the energy cost of acute exercise in athletes.},

Abstract = {The colonization of Madagascar by man is an active subject of scientific
   debate. Until recently the oldest evidence of humans on the island dated
   to a few centuries BC or AD from sites located in the South-West of
   Madagascar. The discoveries at Anjohibe, about 1500 years older,
   indicate an early colonization of the North-West of the island. This
   region is closer than two of the shortest routes from Africa or Asia.
   The discoveries are not archaeological artefacts but cut marks on bones
   of subfossil dwarf hippopotami. These observations indicate that the
   coexistence of humans with extinct subfossil faunas has been much longer
   than previously thought. (C) 2011 Academie des sciences. Published by

Title = {High-resolution chromosome painting reveals the first genetic signature

Journal = {CHROMOSOME RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {19},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Up to now, the composition of synteny-conserved segments in chiropteran
   karyotypes was studied by cross-species chromosome painting with probes
   derived from whole human (HSA) or chiropteran chromosomes only. Here,
   painting probes from the vespertilionid bat Myotis myotis were
   hybridized, for the first time, onto human metaphase chromosomes. The
   segmental composition of bat karyotypes was further refined by
   cross-species painting with probes derived from flow-sorted chromosomes
   of Tupaia belangeri and Eulemur macaco-two species with highly
   rearranged karyotypes. The use of such probes has led to the generation
   of higher resolution maps between human chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11
   and 15 and their counterparts in Vespertilionidae and the pteropodid
   species Eonycteris spelaea. Interestingly, the order of four sub-regions
   within the largest homologous segment delimited by human chromosome 4
   painting probe in Eonyceris was found to be different from that found in
   vespertilionids. A subsequent survey across all major chiropteran
   families demonstrated that a paracentric inversion within this HSA 4
   homologous segment could represent a synapomorphic character for the
   suborder Pteropodiformes.},

Volume = {65},

Abstract = {One of the few mammal species reported to have a mating system of lek
   promiscuity is the tree-hollow nesting marsupial, the agile antechinus,
   Antechinus agilis. Past conclusions about its mating system have been
   based on seasonal changes in social group size, sex-specific nest
   switching and space use. Thermoregulation has also been suggested as an
   explanation for variation in social behaviour in this species and its
   relatives. We tested predictions of the lekking and thermoregulation
   hypotheses to explain sociality in cavity nesting antechinuses using
   published data, and new data on brown and subtropical antechinuses. We
   found that across four species, social group size is negatively
   correlated with daily minimum temperature, but not with timing of
   breeding. Females have a matrilineal fission-fusion social system, which
   continues during the brief mating season, and males range increasingly
   further throughout their lives, contacting as many females as possible
   in nests. Males show no indication of fission-fusion sociality. All
   evidence in species other than A. agilis, and some data on A. agilis,
   indicate a mating system of scramble polygyny, and not lek promiscuity.
   We conclude that across species, thermoregulation is the main reason for
   seasonal variation in nesting group size in both sexes.},

Abstract = {Most research on mammalian heterothermic responses in southern Africa
   tends to be laboratory based and biased towards rodents and smaller
   members of the Afrotheria. In this study, we continuously measured body
   temperature of southern African hedgehogs (Atelerix frontalis) between
   April and August 2009 (-10 degrees C < T-a < 43 degrees C), kept under
   semi-captive conditions. A. frontalis showed a high propensity for
   torpor with animals spending up to 84\% of the measurement period
   torpid. During this study, A. frontalis displayed the lowest T-b (min)
   (ca 1 degrees C) yet recorded in an Afrotropical placental heterotherm.
   Bout lengths of between 0.7 h (40 min) and 116.3 h (4.8 days) were
   recorded. Differences in bout length were observed between lighter
   individuals compared with an individual exhibiting a higher body mass at
   the onset of winter, with low M-b individuals exhibiting daily torpor
   whereas a heavier individual exhibited torpor bouts that were indicative
   of hibernation. Our results suggest that heterothermic responses are an
   important feature in the energy balance equation of this species and
   that body mass at the onset of winter may determine the patterns of
   heterothermy utilised in this species.},

Abstract = {In humans and apes, one of the most adaptive functions of symbols is to
   inhibit strong behavioural predispositions. However, to our knowledge,
   no study has yet investigated whether using symbols provides some
   advantage to non-ape primates. We aimed to trace the evolutionary roots
   of symbolic competence by examining whether tokens improve performance
   in the reverse-reward contingency task in capuchin monkeys, which
   diverged from the human lineage approximately 35 Ma. Eight capuchins
   chose between: (i) two food quantities, (ii) two quantities of
   `low-symbolic distance tokens' (each corresponding to one unit of food),
   and (iii) two `high-symbolic distance tokens' (each corresponding to a
   different amount of food). In all conditions, subjects had to select the
   smaller quantity to obtain the larger reward. No procedural
   modifications were employed. Tokens did improve performance: five
   subjects succeeded with high-symbolic distance tokens, though only one
   succeeded with food, and none succeeded with low-symbolic distance
   tokens. Moreover, two of the five subjects transferred the rule to novel
   token combinations. Learning effects or preference reversals could not
   account for the successful performance with high-symbolic distance
   tokens. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that tokens
   do allow monkeys to inhibit strong behavioural predispositions, as
   occurs in chimpanzees and children.},

Title = {Unresolved molecular phylogenies of gibbons and siamangs (Family:
   Hylobatidae) based on mitochondrial, Y-linked, and X-linked loci
   indicate a rapid Miocene radiation or sudden vicariance event},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {447-455},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {According to recent taxonomic reclassification, the primate family
   Hylobatidae contains four genera (Hoolock, Nomascus, Symphalangus, and
   Hylobates) and between 14 and 18 species, making it by far the most
   species-rich group of extant hominoids. Known as the ``small apes{''},
   these small arboreal primates are distributed throughout Southeast,
   South and East Asia. Considerable uncertainty surrounds the phylogeny of
   extant hylobatids, particularly the relationships among the genera and
   the specie:; within the Hylobates genus. In this paper we use parsimony,
   likelihood, and Bayesian methods to analyze a dataset containing nearly
   14 kilobase pairs, which includes newly collected sequences from
   X-linked, Y-linked, and mitochondrial loci together with data from
   previous mitochondrial studies. Parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian
   analyses largely failed to find a significant difference among
   phylogenies with any of the four genera as the most basal taxon. All
   analyses, however, support a tree with Hylobates and Symphalangus as
   most closely related genera. One strongly supported phylogenetic result
   within the Hylobates genus is that Hylobates pileatus is the most basal
   taxon. Multiple analyses failed to find significant support for any
   singular genus-level phylogeny. While it is natural to suspect that
   there might not be sufficient data for phylogenetic resolution (whenever
   that situation occurs), an alternative hypothesis relating to the nature
   of gibbon speciation exists. This lack of resolution may be the result
   of a rapid radiation or a sudden vicariance event of the hylobatid
   genera, and it is likely that a similarly rapid radiation occurred
   within the Hylobates genus. Additional molecular and paleontological
   evidence are necessary to better test among these, and other, hypotheses
   of hylobatid evolution. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background: Gaudeamus is an enigmatic hystricognathous rodent that was,
   until recently, known solely from fragmentary material from early
   Oligocene sites in Egypt, Oman, and Libya. Gaudeamus' molars are similar
   to those of the extant cane rat Thryonomys, and multiple authorities
   have aligned Gaudeamus with Thryonomys to the exclusion of other living
   and extinct African hystricognaths; recent phylogenetic analyses have,
   however, also suggested affinities with South American caviomorphs or
   Old World porcupines (Hystricidae).

   remains of Gaudeamus, including largely complete but crushed crania and
   complete upper and lower dentitions. Unlike younger Gaudeamus species,
   the primitive species described here have relatively complex occlusal
   patterns, and retain a number of plesiomorphic features. Unconstrained
   parsimony analysis nests Gaudeamus and Hystrix within the South American
   caviomorph radiation, implying what we consider to be an implausible
   back-dispersal across the Atlantic Ocean to account for Gaudeamus'
   presence in the late Eocene of Africa. An analysis that was constrained
   to recover the biogeographically more plausible hypothesis of caviomorph
   monophyly does not place Gaudeamus as a stem caviomorph, but rather as a
   sister taxon of hystricids.
   Conclusions/Significance: We place Gaudeamus species in a new family,
   Gaudeamuridae, and consider it likely that the group originated,
   diversified, and then went extinct over a geologically brief period of
   time during the latest Eocene and early Oligocene in Afro-Arabia.
   Gaudeamurids are the only known crown hystricognaths from Afro-Arabia
   that are likely to be aligned with non-phiomorph members of that clade,
   and as such provide additional support for an Afro-Arabian origin of
   advanced stem and basal crown members of Hystricognathi.},

Abstract = {We summarize morphometric data collected over a period of 22 years from
   a natural population of rainforest sifakas (Propithecus edwardsi) at
   Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, and we use those data to document
   patterns of growth and development. Individually identified, known-age
   sifakas were successfully captured, measured, and released. We found
   that body segment lengths increased faster during growth than did body
   mass, with individuals attaining adult lengths earlier than adult mass.
   Females can begin reproducing before they are fully grown, but this may
   not be common. With the exception of hand length, we found no
   significant sex difference in any adult metric including body mass,
   chest, and limb circumferences, body segment lengths, and canine tooth
   height; however, body masses of individual females fluctuated more,
   independently of pregnancy, than did those of males. We found
   considerable interannual fluctuation in body mass with single
   individuals differing more within the same season in different years
   than from season to season in the same year. Such body mass fluctuation
   may be a consequence of eastern Madagascar's variable and unpredictable
   environment in which rainfall during any selected month varies from year
   to year. Am. J. Primatol. 73: 155-172, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Vervet monkey alarm call behaviour has long been the paradigmatic
   example of how primates use vocalisations to protect themselves from
   predators. In these primates, there is a close link between different
   types of vocalisations and different types of predators. More recent
   work has shown that there are alternative ways in which primates use
   vocalisations to cope with predation, suggesting that the one-call /
   one-predator type alarm calling system may not be universal among
   primates. Here, we describe studies on the alarm call system of
   putty-nosed monkeys at Gashaka Gumti National Park / Nigeria. We found
   that the adult males regularly produce two acoustically distinct alarm
   call types but neither is given exclusively to one predator. There are
   striking regularities in how calls are ordered into more complex
   combinations, one of which, the pyow-hack sequence, is tightly linked to
   subsequent behaviour and apparently functions to initiate group
   movements. The remainder are each associated with a range of contexts
   and so appear to provide information which differs from the alarm calls
   of other guenon species studied to date. Our research focuses on
   understanding whether the different call series might encode information
   at different levels, such as predator type, degree of threat or urgency,
   or the callers imminent behaviour. More broadly, our aim is to
   characterise the cognitive mechanisms underlying primate communication
   from which human language has evolved.},

Abstract = {Objective: This work presents the specification and components of a
   Building Accessibility Service (BASE) that is aimed for providing
   localization and route planning in unknown indoor environments. This new
   service will provide goal selection and route descriptions in order to
   reach the desired destination depending on user's profile. BASE will be
   most often used in places frequently visited, such as commercial
   centers, administration buildings, cultural and educative centers,
   hospitals, and so. One of the possible benefits of this service is to
   make easier the participation of people with disabilities in social life
   by increasing their autonomy.
   Main content: This Service has several components: in one side, BASE
   must be created and maintained by a Services Provider; other side of
   BASE will be resident on the specific building, which must be equipped
   with some standard wireless communication devices; finally, users must
   carry with them a suitable communication and processing platform in
   order to use this service. In the Service Provider side, the Buildings
   Accessibility Service is based on a set of XML description files that
   contain all the information needed to access public or private
   buildings: floor maps, accessibility information, available routes and
   landmarks. In the building side, two different wireless networks are
   needed: a Wi-Fi network to connect to BASE through Internet; and a
   Sensor Network (SN) to provide indoor location. The SN is based on a set
   of wireless nodes equipped with ZigBee devices; RSSI (Received Signal
   Strength Indication) from fixed nodes are used to compute an approximate
   3D location to reinforce user positioning inside buildings.
   Results: A test environment is described using the proposed XML
   description. According to user's profile, BASE provides the best route
   between any two points in it. Actual tests have been made using a
   prototype of an Ambient Assisted Wheelchair (A2W), equipped with a set
   of computing and communication devices.
   Conclusion: BASE is a powerful tool able to provide location and
   navigation services trough indoor environments. Although it has been
   tested with and advanced wheelchair prototype, this system can also be
   used by other kind of users, as its information may also be presented on
   the screen of a handheld device to provide the best route to users of
   standard wheelchairs or pedestrians.},

Title = {The role of security and trust in the adoption of online tax filing},
Journal = {TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT- PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Pages = {303-318},
Abstract = {Purpose -The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of
   six determinants on taxpayers' intention to adopt e-file systems. The
   proposed model integrates technology adoption factors from the unified
   theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model with personal
   perceptions on trust, efficacy, and security into one parsimonious yet
   explanatory model of e-file adoption.
   Design/methodology/approach -A survey was administered to 304 US
   taxpayers to capture their perceptions of e-filing. The survey was
   developed using existing scales in the literature. Responses were
   measured on a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly
   disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The results were tested using multiple
   linear regression analysis.
   Findings -The findings of this research show that theoretical constructs
   from the UTAUT model are well suited in explaining intentions to use
   multiple e-government services. Specifically, the results indicate that
   three factors from the UTAUT model (performance expectancy, effort
   expectancy, and social influence) play a significant role in predicting
   taxpayers' e-filing intentions. More importantly, the research findings
   indicate that personal factors (web-specific self-efficacy (WSSE) and
   perceived security control), along with UTAUT factors, have a
   significant impact on taxpayers' e-file intentions. The proposed model
   explains 63.5 percent of the variance in taxpayers' e-file intentions.
   Research limitations/implications -This study contributes to the
   literature by integrating determinants from the UTAUT model with
   personal perception factors to explain e-file adoption. This merging of
   UTAUT with theories, such as social cognition, that emphasize human
   perception, is the direction that must be taken by researchers in an
   effort to understand taxpayers' intentions to adopt e-file systems.
   While the proposed model explained 63.5 percent of the variation in
   e-file use intention, there are limitations to this research. The
   participants in this research are not sufficiently diverse in culture,
   socio-economic level, etc. and 89 percent of the research participants
   are Caucasian. In addition, the participants were recruited from limited
   geographical locations. The strength of the model should be validated
   using more diverse research participants that will increase the
   variation in the data collected.
   Originality/value -The paper presents a parsimonious, yet integrated,
   model of e-file diffusion. The integration of adoption factors with
   personal perceptions of trust, efficacy, and security represents a
   significant step forward in explaining e-file adoption.},

Title = {Relationships between the expression of the stapedial artery and the
   size of the obturator foramen in euarchontans: Functional and
   phylogenetic implications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {60},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cranial arterial patterns are commonly used for determining phylogenetic
   patterns in extant taxa and have often been used in studies
   investigating the relationships among fossil taxa. In primitive
   eutherians, the stapedial artery provided blood to the meninges, orbits,
   and certain regions of the face. In many modern mammals, however, blood
   supply to most of these areas has been taken over by branches of the
   external carotid, although some groups (e.g., treeshrews, some families
   of primates) still retain aspects of the ancestral pattern. Here, we
   show that the relative size of the obturator foramen of the stapes is a
   reliable indicator of the presence or absence of a ``functional{''}
   stapedial artery in Euarchonta. We also describe newly discovered
   stapedes for extinct euarchontans, Ignacius graybullianus, and
   Plesiadapis tricuspidens, and use the approach described here to show
   that these taxa likely did not have a functional stapedial artery. The
   implications of these findings for auditory function and phylogenetic
   studies are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   INTERACTIONS},
Journal = {ECOTROPICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-52},
Abstract = {Due to their principally arboreal way of life, primates can potentially
   interact with flowers from a broad diversity of tropical and subtropical
   plants. In fact the consumption of flowers and/or nectar has been
   reported for many primate species, but the role in primate diets is
   generally underestimated. Also, evidence has been provided for the role
   of some primate species as pollinators. This paper aims at reviewing
   information on the interactions between primates and flowers and to
   examine factors like body mass and dietary strategy as determinants for
   the type of interaction, i.e. whether entire flowers or nectar are
   consumed. I also review the available evidence for pollination by
   primates and the consequences of flower predation for subsequent fruit
   set. I conclude that (a) the contribution of flowers and/or nectar to
   primate diets can be substantial, at least seasonally, and therefore (b)
   primate-flower interactions (flower predation, pollination) are more
   prevalent and may have larger impact on affected plants than previously
   thought. Accepted 27 January 2011.},

   African continent has vast resources that are incredibly valuable to
   this endeavor, including an enormous variety of extant species, as well
   as a rich fossil record covering human evolution and many aspects of
   vertebrate evolution. This paper briefly outlines the current situation
   in terms of collections in Africa, most of which are found in South
   Africa. It is hoped that these brief descriptions will increase
   international scientific interest in the available collections.},

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {82},
Number = {3},
Pages = {177-188},
Abstract = {Among primates, apes and monkeys are known to use their hands and to
   exhibit independent control of their fingers. In comparison, Prosimii
   are thought to have less digital individualization and to use their
   mouth more commonly for prehension. Unfortunately, prehension and
   manipulation studies in Prosimii have been conducted in conditions
   constraining the subject to grasp with the hand. Moreover, the effect of
   food size remains unexplored, even though it could affect the use of the
   hands versus the mouth. Thus, whether prosimians use the hand or the
   mouth to grasp and manipulate food items of different sizes in
   unconstrained conditions remains unclear. To address this question, we
   characterized the eating and manipulation patterns of Microcebus murinus
   in unconstrained conditions, using three food sizes. The results showed
   that M. murinus showed (i) an eating pattern similar to that of rodents,
   with smaller food items being grasped with the mouth, (ii) a greater
   tendency to use the hands for prehension of larger foods, and (iii)
   plasticity during food manipulation similar to that which has been
   observed in rodents. These results are discussed in the framework of
   grasping in mammals and are used to discuss the origins of prehension in
   primates. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {This introductory article sketches the history of tarsier research
   beginning with the first description of a tarsier in 1706, and
   continuing with early anatomical and embryological investigations in the
   middle and by the end of the 19th century. The first half of the 20th
   century produced a considerable number of more or less episodic studies
   often focusing on behavioral biology of (short-term) captive
   observations. A systematic collection of tarsiers in the 1940 s by
   Wharton, transported to the United States, and several tarsiers brought
   to Germany by Harrisson led to the first long-term field study in
   Borneo. This study investigated the functional anatomy of the skin,
   biometry and corresponding evolutionary interpretations, anatomy, and
   locomotion in Bornean tarsiers as well as many aspects of their
   behavior. It also recorded diseases and traumatological data and
   interpreted these with regard to fitness and the survival of the
   species. I close this abbreviated history of tarsier research before the
   last 20 yr with 2 studies, 1 on the physiology and evolution of brown
   adipose tissue and 1 on convergent evolution with owls.},

   Miocene (similar to 20 Ma) deposits in East Africa. A recent analysis of
   partial mandibles and maxillae of Eochrysochloris, Jawharia, and
   Widanelfarasia, from the latest Eocene and earliest Oligocene of Egypt,
   led to the suggestion that the derived ``zalambdomorph{''} molar
   occlusal pattern (i.e., extreme reduction or loss of upper molar
   metacones and lower molar talonids) seen in tenrecoids and
   chrysochloroids evolved independently in the two lineages, and that
   tenrecoids might be derived from a dilambdomorph group of
   ``insectivoran-grade{''} placentals that includes forms such as
   Widanelfarasia. Here I describe the oldest afrosoricid from the Fayum
   region, similar to 37 Ma Dilambdogale gheerbranti gen. et sp. nov., and
   the youngest, similar to 30 Ma Qatranilestes oligocaenus gen. et sp.
   nov. Dilambdogale is the most generalized of the Fayum afrosoricids,
   exhibiting relatively broad and well-developed molar talonids and a
   dilambdomorph arrangement of the buccal crests on the upper molars,
   whereas Qatranilestes is the most derived in showing relatively extreme
   reduction of molar talonids. These occurrences are consistent with a
   scenario in which features of the zalambdomorph occlusal complex were
   acquired independently and gradually through the later Paleogene.
   Phylogenetic analysis places Dilambdogale and Widanelfarasia as sister
   taxa to the exclusion of crown afrosoricids, but derived features that
   these taxa share with early Miocene Protenrec hint at the possibility
   that both taxa might be stem tenrecoids. Late Paleocene Todralestes and
   Afrodon from Morocco are similarly placed as stem afrosoricids,
   indicating that African adapisoriculids (including Garatherium) might
   also be relevant to the origin of the tenrecoid and chrysochloroid
   clades.},

Abstract = {Isotopic studies of wild primates have used a wide range of tissues to
   infer diet and model the foraging ecologies of extinct species. The use
   of mismatched tissues for such comparisons can be problematic because
   differences in amino acid compositions can lead to small isotopic
   differences between tissues. Additionally, physiological and dietary
   differences among primate species could lead to variable offsets between
   apatite carbonate and collagen. To improve our understanding of the
   isotopic chemistry of primates, we explored the apparent enrichment
   (epsilon{*}) between bone collagen and muscle, collagen and fur or hair
   keratin, muscle and keratin, and collagen and bone carbonate across the
   primate order. We found that the mean epsilon{*} values of proteinaceous
   tissues were small (a parts per thousand currency sign1aEuro degrees),
   and uncorrelated with body size or phylogenetic relatedness.
   Additionally, epsilon{*} values did not vary by habitat, sex, age, or
   manner of death. The mean epsilon{*} value between bone carbonate and
   collagen (5.6 +/- A 1.2aEuro degrees) was consistent with values
   reported for omnivorous mammals consuming monoisotopic diets. These
   primate-specific apparent enrichment values will be a valuable tool for
   cross-species comparisons. Additionally, they will facilitate dietary
   comparisons between living and fossil primates.},

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {Madagascar has an exceptionally large fauna of more than 250 species of
   endemic dung beetles. Based on molecular phylogenies, the species
   descend from eight independent overseas colonisations, of which four
   have given rise to big radiations. Here, we analyse the tribe Canthonini
   with three parallel radiations following the respective colonisations at
   64-44 Mya (Arachnodes-Epilissus, 101 species), 30-19 Mya (Epactoides, 37
   species), and 24-15 Mya (Apotolamprus-Nanos, 61 species). All three
   radiations have taken place in forests, but there are also substantial
   differences between them. The oldest radiation exhibits the greatest
   ecological diversification, including monophyletic groups of primate and
   cattle dung specialists and multiple shifts to arboreal foraging.
   Analysis of pairs of sister species suggests allopatric speciation in
   the oldest and the youngest, apparently non-adaptive, radiations,
   whereas in Epactoides closely related species have diverged ecologically
   and have largely overlapping geographical ranges, suggestive of adaptive
   radiation in parapatry or regional sympatry. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Moonstruck Primates: Owl Monkeys (Aotus) Need Moonlight for Nocturnal
   Activity in Their Natural Environment},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {Primates show activity patterns ranging from nocturnality to diurnality,
   with a few species showing activity both during day and night. Among
   anthropoids (monkeys, apes and humans), nocturnality is only present in
   the Central and South American owl monkey genus Aotus. Unlike other
   tropical Aotus species, the Azara's owl monkeys (A. azarai) of the
   subtropics have switched their activity pattern from strict nocturnality
   to one that also includes regular diurnal activity. Harsher climate,
   food availability, and the lack of predators or diurnal competitors,
   have all been proposed as factors favoring evolutionary switches in
   primate activity patterns. However, the observational nature of most
   field studies has limited an understanding of the mechanisms responsible
   for this switch in activity patterns. The goal of our study was to
   evaluate the hypothesis that masking, namely the stimulatory and/or
   inhibitory/disinhibitory effects of environmental factors on
   synchronized circadian locomotor activity, is a key determinant of the
   unusual activity pattern of Azara's owl monkeys. We use continuous
   long-term (6-18 months) 5-min-binned activity records obtained with
   actimeter collars fitted to wild owl monkeys (n = 10 individuals) to
   show that this different pattern results from strong masking of activity
   by the inhibiting and enhancing effects of ambient luminance and
   temperature. Conclusive evidence for the direct masking effect of light
   is provided by data showing that locomotor activity was almost
   completely inhibited when moonlight was shadowed during three lunar
   eclipses. Temperature also negatively masked locomotor activity, and
   this masking was manifested even under optimal light conditions. Our
   results highlight the importance of the masking of circadian rhythmicity
   as a determinant of nocturnality in wild owl monkeys and suggest that
   the stimulatory effects of dim light in nocturnal primates may have been
   selected as an adaptive response to moonlight. Furthermore, our data
   indicate that changes in sensitivity to specific environmental stimuli
   may have been an essential key for evolutionary switches between diurnal
   and nocturnal habits in primates.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {85},
Number = {3},
Pages = {545-569},

Abstract = {Huddling allows individuals to maximise energy savings by (1) decreasing
   their cold-exposed body surface area, (2) reducing their heat loss
   through warming of ambient temperatures surrounding the group, and (3)
   eventually lowering their body temperature through physiological
   processes. Huddling provides substantial energy savings and is estimated
   to reduce energy expenditure by between 6 and 53\%. Broad variations in
   the energetic benefits of huddling depend on the number of individuals
   and species involved in huddles, the ambient temperatures to which
   individuals are exposed and the density of the aggregations. It has been
   shown that huddling individuals have increased survival, a lower food
   intake, a decreased body mass loss, increased growth rate, reduced water
   loss, and/or a more constant body temperature together with a
   significant reduction in metabolic rate. Though huddling has been
   studied widely, this review reveals the intricacies of this adaptive
   behaviour.},

Abstract = {The United States Congress has set ambitious goals for the diffusion of
   e-government initiatives. One of congress' goals for the 2007 tax year
   was for 80\% of tax and informational returns to be filed electronically
   (IRS., 2004). In 2008,90 million Americans choose to e-file (IRS.,
   2009); however, Congress' goal of 80\% adoption has still fallen short.
   This paper integrates the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of
   Technology (UTAUT) model, online trust, perceived risk, and optimism
   bias into a comprehensive model of e-file adoption. To empirically test
   the model a survey is administered to 260 United States taxpayers.
   Structural equation modeling is used to evaluate relationships between
   these concepts and intention to use. Results indicate performance
   expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and optimism bias
   all have a significant impact on e-file intention. Trust in the internet
   and trust in the e-file provider were shown to significantly influence
   perceived risk. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

   lofty goal has fallen well short. This research proposes a model of
   e-filing adoption. To test the model a survey is administered to 260
   participants. The instrument assesses citizen perceptions of trust, risk
   and optimism bias. Structural equation modeling is used to evaluate the
   relationships between these three concepts and intention to use. The
   results indicate that trust of the Internet, trust of the e-filer,
   perceived risk and optimism bias all have an impact on intention to use
   e-filing. Implications for practice and research are discussed.},

Title = {The Climatic Niche Diversity of Malagasy Primates: A Phylogenetic
   Perspective},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 11},
Abstract = {Background: Numerous researchers have posited that there should be a
   strong negative relationship between the evolutionary distance among
   species and their ecological similarity. Alternative evidence suggests
   that members of adaptive radiations should display no relationship
   between divergence time and ecological similarity because rapid
   evolution results in near-simultaneous speciation early in the clade's
   history. In this paper, we performed the first investigation of
   ecological diversity in a phylogenetic context using a mammalian
   adaptive radiation, the Malagasy primates.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We collected data for 43 extant species
   including: 1) 1064 species by locality samples, 2) GIS climate data for
   each sampling locality, and 3) the phylogenetic relationships of the
   species. We calculated the niche space of each species by summarizing
   the climatic variation at localities of known occurrence. Climate data
   from all species occurrences at all sites were entered into a principal
   components analysis. We calculated the mean value of the first two PCA
   axes, representing rainfall and temperature diversity, for each species.
   We calculated the K statistic using the Physig program for Matlab to
   examine how well the climatic niche space of species was correlated with
   phylogeny.
   Conclusions/Significance: We found that there was little relationship
   between the phylogenetic distance of Malagasy primates and their
   rainfall and temperature niche space, i.e., closely related species tend
   to occupy different climatic niches. Furthermore, several species from
   different genera converged on a similar climatic niche. These results
   have important implications for the evolution of ecological diversity,
   and the long-term survival of these endangered species.},

Title = {Ecological biogeography of Malagasy non-volant mammals: community
   structure is correlated with habitat},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1144-1159},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aim
   To examine the relationship between ecoregions, as a proxy for regional
   climate and habitat type, and mammalian community structure, defined by
   species composition and richness (e.g. taxonomic structure) and
   ecological diversity (e.g. ecological structure) of non-volant species.
   Location
   Madagascar.
   Methods
   Faunal lists of non-volant mammal species occurring in 35 communities
   from five World Wildlife Fund ecoregions were collected from published
   and unpublished sources. Species were assigned to ecological groups
   defined by trophic status, locomotor habits, activity cycle and body
   mass. We used Mantel tests, cluster analysis and principal coordinates
   analysis to evaluate geographic patterning in taxonomic composition and
   species richness. We used stepwise multiple discriminant analysis to
   characterize patterns in the ecological diversity of the mammalian
   communities from each ecoregion. Communities from transitional habitats
   (e.g. representing more than one ecoregion) were used to test the
   predictive power of the analyses.
   Results
   Non-volant mammal communities divided into clusters that correspond to
   ecoregions. There was a strong distance effect in the taxonomic
   structure of communities across the island and within both humid and dry
   forest communities, but this effect was weak within humid forest
   communities. Mammalian species richness was significantly lower in dry
   forest than in humid forest communities. The ecological structure of
   communities was also correlated with ecoregions. Changes in the relative
   percentages of omnivory, arboreal quadrupedalism, terrestrial/arboreal
   quadrupedalism and two body mass classes accounted for 98.1\% of the
   variation in ecological structure. Transitional communities were
   projected in intermediate positions by the discriminant model.
   Main conclusions
   Our analysis demonstrates that the broad-scale habitat and climate
   variables captured by the ecoregion model have shaped the assembly of
   non-volant mammal communities in Madagascar over evolutionary time. The
   spatial pattern is consistent with ecological sorting of species ranges
   along environmental gradients. Historical processes, such as recent
   extinction and migration, may have also affected the structure of mammal
   communities, although these factors have played a secondary role.},

Title = {A fossil primate of uncertain affinities from the earliest late Eocene

Abstract = {Paleontological work carried out over the last 3 decades has established
   that three major primate groups were present in the Eocene of
   Africa-anthropoids, adapiforms, and advanced strepsirrhines. Here we
   describe isolated teeth of a previously undocumented primate from the
   earliest late Eocene (approximate to 37 Ma) of northern Egypt, Nosmips
   aenigmaticus, whose phylogenetic placement within Primates is unclear.
   Nosmips is smaller than the sympatric adapiform Afradapis but is
   considerably larger than other primate taxa known from the same
   paleocommunity. The species bears an odd mosaic of dental features,
   combining enlarged, elongate, and molariform premolars with simple upper
   molars that lack hypocones. Phylogenetic analysis across a series of
   different assumption sets variously places Nosmips as a stem anthropoid,
   a nonadapiform stem strepsirrhine, or even among adapiforms. This
   phylogenetic instability suggests to us that Nosmips likely represents a
   highly specialized member of a previously undocumented, and presumably
   quite ancient, endemic African primate lineage, the subordinal
   affinities of which have been obscured by its striking dental
   autapomorphies. Discriminant functions based on measurements of lower
   molar size and topography reliably classify extant prosimian primates
   into their correct dietary groups and identify Nosmips and Afradapis as
   omnivores and folivores, respectively. Although Nosmips currently defies
   classification, this strange and unexpected fossil primate nevertheless
   provides additional evidence for high primate diversity in northern
   Africa approximate to 37 million years ago and further underscores the
   fact that our understanding of early primate evolution on that continent
   remains highly incomplete.},

Title = {Nlcam modulates midline convergence during anterior neural plate

Journal = {DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {339},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {During development, different cell types must undergo distinct
   morphogenetic programs so that tissues develop the right dimensions in
   the appropriate place. In early eye morphogenesis, retinal progenitor
   cells (RPCs) move first towards the midline, before turning around to
   migrate out into the evaginating optic vesicles. Neighbouring forebrain
   cells, however, converge rapidly and then remain at the midline. These
   differential behaviours are regulated by the transcription factor Rx3.
   Here, we identify a downstream target of Rx3, the Ig-domain protein
   Nlcam, and characterise its role in regulating cell migration during the
   initial phase of optic vesicle morphogenesis. Through sophisticated live
   imaging and comprehensive cell tracking experiments in zebrafish, we
   show that ectopic expression of Nlcam in RPCs, as is observed in Rx3
   mutants, causes enhanced convergence of these cells. Expression levels
   of Nlcam therefore regulate the migratory properties of RPCs. Our
   results provide evidence that the two phases of optic vesicle
   morphogenesis: slowed convergence and outward-directed migration, are
   under different genetic control. We propose that Nlcam forms part of the
   guidance machinery directing rapid midline migration of forebrain
   precursors, where it is normally expressed, and that its ectopic
   expression upon loss of Rx3 imparts these migratory characteristics upon
   RPCs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Primates are traditionally considered to be microsmatic, with decreased
   reliance on olfactory senses in comparison to other sensory modalities
   such as vision. This is particularly the case for Old World monkeys and
   apes (catarrhines). However, various lines of evidence suggest that
   chemical communication may be important in these species, including the
   presence of a sternal scent-gland in the mandrill. We investigated the
   volatile components of mandrill odor using gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry. We identified a total of 97 volatile components in 88
   swabs of the sternal gland secretion and 95 samples of sternal gland
   hair saturated with scent-gland secretion collected from 27 males and 18
   females. We compared odor profiles with features of the signaler using
   principle components and discriminant function analyses and found that
   volatile profiles convey both variable (age, dominance rank in males)
   and fixed (sex, possibly individual identity) information about the
   signaler. The combination of an odor profile that signals sex, age, and
   rank with increased motivation to scent-mark and increased production of
   secretion in high-ranking males leads to a potent signal of the presence
   of a dominant, adult male with high testosterone levels. This may be
   particularly relevant in the dense Central African rain forest which
   mandrills inhabit. By contrast, we were unable to differentiate between
   either female cycle stage or female rank based on odor profiles, which
   accords with behavioral studies suggesting that odor signals are not as
   important in female mandrills as they are in males. The similarity of
   our findings to those for other mammals and in primates that are more
   distantly related to humans suggests a broader role for odor in primate
   communication than is currently recognized.},

Abstract = {Mammals chew more rhythmically than lepidosaurs. The research presented
   here evaluated possible reasons for this difference in relation to
   differences between lepidosaurs and mammals in sensorimotor systems.
   Variance in the absolute and relative durations of the phases of the
   gape cycle was calculated from kinematic data from four species of
   primates and eight species of lepidosaurs. The primates exhibit less
   variance in the duration of the gape cycle than in the durations of the
   four phases making up the gape cycle. This suggests that increases in
   the durations of some gape cycle phases are accompanied by decreases in
   others. Similar effects are much less pronounced in the lepidosaurs. In
   addition, the primates show isometric changes in gape cycle phase
   durations, i.e. the relative durations of the phases of the gape cycle
   change little with increasing cycle time. In contrast, in the
   lepidosaurs variance in total gape cycle duration is associated with
   increases in the proportion of the cycle made up by the slow open phase.
   We hypothesize that in mammals the central nervous system includes a
   representation of the optimal chew cycle duration maintained using
   afferent feedback about the ongoing state of the chew cycle. The
   differences between lepidosaurs and primates do not lie in the nature of
   the sensory information collected and its feedback to the feeding
   system, but rather the processing of that information by the CNS and its
   use feed-forward for modulating jaw movements and gape cycle phase
   durations during chewing.},

Title = {Attitudes and practices of dermatologists and primary care physicians
   who treat patients for MPHL: results of a survey},
Journal = {CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {345-354},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objectives:
   The study's objectives were (a) to characterize physicians' attitudes
   and practices in relation to treating male pattern hair loss (MPHL), (b)
   to examine differences vis-a-vis physician distinctions, and (c) to
   consider the findings in relation to published research on MPHL
   patients' treatment-seeking experiences.
   Methods:
   The online survey across six countries (United States, France, Germany,
   Spain, Japan, and Korea) involved 466 physicians (263 dermatologists and
   203 primary care physicians {[}PCPs]) who at least occasionally treat
   patients for MPHL.
   Results:
   Over 50\% of physicians were cognizant of patients' concerns and the
   impact of hair loss on patients' quality of life. Moreover, 65\% were
   comfortable talking about MPHL with patients, and 62\% were comfortable
   recommending treatment. On the other hand, about one-third of surveyed
   physicians were not especially comfortable assessing and treating MPHL.
   Relative to PCPs, dermatologists reported a significantly greater
   likelihood of spending time answering questions about MPHL and
   treatments (89 vs. 74\%, p<0.001), providing informational materials or
   brochures about MPHL (58 vs. 28\%, p<0.001), and letting the patient
   know that he/she frequently treats MPHL (40 vs. 28\%, p<0.006). Similar
   significant differences were evident in comparisons of frequent and
   non-frequent treaters. The primary goal physicians set for patients was
   prevention of additional hair loss (79\%); secondary goals included
   preventing additional hair thinning/loss with potential for re-growth
   (65\%) and informing patients they would see visible results within a
   year (63\%). Study limitations include a lack of verification that
   physicians' responses reflect their actual clinical practice and the
   possibility that physicians enrolled in a research database do not
   represent the general physician population.
   Conclusions:
   In contrast to physicians less experienced with MPHL treatment,
   dermatologists and other physicians frequently treating MPHL have
   attitudes and practices that may foster a favorable context for MPHL
   patient care.},

Title = {A primitive hyracoid (Mammalia, Paenungulata) from the early Priabonian
   (Late Eocene) of Egypt},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC PALAEONTOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {213-244},
Abstract = {A new hyracoid genus and species, Dimaitherium patnaiki from the early
   Late Eocene (early Priabonian) Birket Qarun Formation in the Fayum
   Depression, Egypt, is described. The material is approximately 37
   million years old and three million years older than any other hyracoid
   known from the Fayum area. A partial cranium preserves features that are
   likely primitive within Paenungulata, such as a postorbital process made
   up solely of the frontals (without a parietal contribution), a
   restricted jugal contribution to the anterior orbital margin, and an
   anteriorly positioned orbit. The internal mandibular fenestra, a
   peculiar feature seen in many younger Fayum hyracoids, is primitively
   absent in Dimaitherium, but a coronoid canal is present at the base of
   the ascending ramus as in later hyracoids. The dentition of Dimaitherium
   shows several primitive characteristics, such as poorly molarised
   premolars, but otherwise differs little from many younger hyracoids.
   Phylogenetic analysis consistently places younger hyracoids, including
   procaviids, in a clade to the exclusion of Dimaitherium and the much
   older Seggeurius and Microhyrax. Given the phylogenetic hypotheses
   proposed here, the presence of `broken' hypocristids on the lower molars
   is likely to have evolved more than once during hyracoid evolution.
   Evidence from the humerus, astragalus and calcaneum indicate that
   Dimaitherium may have been an agile climber, and was likely capable of
   rapid movement but was not cursorially adapted. Of the other two small
   Fayum hyracoids, Dimaitherium was more similar to Thyrohyrax than to
   Saghatherium. The presence of only this single genus and species in the
   Birket Qarun localities cannot be explained by depositional biases, and
   makes an ancient origin for the Fayum hyracoid lineages unlikely. The
   poorly known large-bodied Early Eocene hyracoids `Megalohyrax' gevini
   and `Titanohyrax' mongereaui and tantulus from Algeria and Tunisia were
   not placed with Fayum species of Megalohyrax or Titanohyrax in our
   phylogenetic analyses. It is unlikely that these species belong to those
   genera and provide no compelling evidence for an Early Eocene or
   Paleocene divergence of the Fayum hyracoid lineages.},

Abstract = {Governments and corporations are increasingly considering the use of the
   Internet for individuals to cast votes. Yet, not everyone has access to
   and is comfortable with the use of technology. This is the problem of
   the digital divide. This study explores the impact of the digital divide
   on Internet voting (I-voting). A model of I-voting and the digital
   divide is proposed. The proposed model suggests that age, income,
   education and frequency of Internet use have an impact on I-voting
   utilization. To test the model both an online and paper-based version of
   the survey was administered to a large sample of citizens. The results
   of multiple linear regressions indicate that age and income (access and
   skills) have a significant impact on Internet voting. These findings
   indicate that, like other e-government services, I-voting is subject to
   the barriers associated with the digital divide, and this digital divide
   introduces several challenges to government agencies.},

Title = {Adaptive phenotypic plasticity and resilience of vertebrates to
   increasing climatic unpredictability},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {135-147},
Abstract = {As ecosystems undergo global changes, there is increasing interest in
   understanding how organisms respond to changing environments. Recent
   evidence drawn from available vertebrate studies suggests that most of
   the phenotypic responses to climate change would be due to plasticity.
   We hypothesize that organisms that have evolved in unpredictable
   environments inform us about the mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity
   which provide an adaptive response to climate instability. As climate
   changes increase climatic hazards, these resilience mechanisms are
   expected to spread within species, populations and communities. We
   review studies that have demonstrated the importance of phenotypic
   plasticity in different life-history traits in overcoming climate
   uncertainty. We focus on organisms from unstable, recurrently
   energetically restrictive environments which possess a variety of
   morphological, physiological and/or behavioural adaptations to
   climate-driven selective pressures. First, we treat plastic
   morphological changes in response to fluctuating food availability.
   Adjustment of morphometric traits and/or organ size to energy supply
   would be essential in harsh environments. Second, we review the role of
   flexible energy-saving mechanisms, such as daily torpor, hibernation and
   energy storage, in overcoming climate-driven energetic shortages.
   Lastly, we address the role of plastic modulation of reproduction in
   fine-tuning the energy allocation to offspring production according to
   environmental conditions, with an emphasis on opportunistic breeding.
   Overall, we predict that species (or genotypes) possessing these
   efficient physiological mechanisms of resilience to unpredictable water
   and food fluctuations will be selectively advantaged in the face of
   increasing climatic instability.},

Title = {Intergroup Aggression in Primates and Humans: The Case for a Unified
   Theory},
Booktitle = {MIND THE GAP: TRACING THE ORIGINS OF HUMAN UNIVERSALS},
Year = {2010},
Pages = {171-195},
Abstract = {Human warfare and intergroup aggression among primates have
   traditionally been considered to be largely unrelated phenomena.
   Recently, however, chimpanzee intergroup violence has been proposed to
   show evolutionary continuities with war among small-scale societies
   because both systems involve interactions among temporary subgroups,
   deliberate attempts to hunt and maim, and demographically significant
   death rates. Here, we ask whether the functional similarities between
   intergroup aggression among humans and chimpanzees can be extended to
   troop-living primates. In most primates, patterns of intergroup
   aggression involve brief encounters among stable troops, rare violence,
   and almost no killing. Although they, therefore, show little behavioral
   resemblance to warfare, growing evidence indicates that intergroup
   dominance is adaptively important in primates because it predicts
   long-term fitness. This suggests that in all primates, including humans,
   individuals use coalitions to maintain or expand access to resources by
   dominating their neighbors. Thus, while the style of coalitionary
   aggression depends on each species' evolutionary ecology, we propose
   that the essential functional reasons for intergroup competition are
   consistent across group-living primates and humans: strength in numbers
   predicts long-term access to resources.},

Abstract = {This article reports the first genetic study of the mating system of the
   Sichuan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana), an endemic and
   endangered species in China. The investigation was carried out in a
   population (WRT) in the Qinling Mountains using data from both field
   observation and paternity analysis through microsatellite DNA profiling.
   During a mating season, a male on an average copulated with 5.7 females.
   Approximately 18\% of the females were observed to copulate with more
   than one male over the study period. The majority of copulations
   (94.5\%) were initiated by females. Twenty-eight of 430 observed matings
   were extra-unit copulations. Eight polymorphic microsatellite loci were
   used for paternity analysis. The number of alleles at each locus ranged
   from 3 to 7 (mean=4.3). Observed heterozygosity ranged between 0.32 and
   0.79. None of the loci showed significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg
   equilibrium. Results from paternity exclusion showed that 12 of 21
   (57.1\%) immature individuals were sired by extra-unit males. Although
   the basic social unit of snub-nosed monkeys is consistent with a
   polygynous mating system, both field observation and genetic data
   suggests that their mating system is polygamous. Infanticide and
   inbreeding avoidance are the most likely explanations for the
   promiscuity of female snub-nosed monkeys. Am. J. Primatol. 72:25-32,

Abstract = {Diversity and longitudinal species turnover of small mammals in the
   forests of watersheds of western Madagascar. - The species diversity of
   Malagasy small mammals is assessed along three different east-west
   flowing rivers passing through different forest formations and of
   different length: Soahany (short river), Manambolo (medium-length
   river), and the Mangoky (long river). The levels of species replacement
   (beta-diversity) are evaluated along these three different longitudinal
   gradients. Twenty-two sites were inventoried, six along the Soahany
   River, five along the Manambolo River, and 11 along the Mangoky River.
   Thirty-five species of small mammals were documented at these sites,
   composed of 21 species of endemic Afrosoricida (Tenrecidae); two species
   of Soricomorpha including one endemic (Suncus madagascariensis) and one
   introduced (S. murinus); and 12 species of Rodentia including 10
   endemics (Nesomyidae) and two introduced species (Ratios rattus and Mus
   musculus). There was a correlation between species richness and the
   length of each river basin: Mangoky has the greatest species richness
   (29 taxa), followed by the Manambolo (11 taxa) and the Soahany (10
   taxa). alpha-diversity augments with increasing habitat complexity and
   surface area. Humid forest sites in the central highlands near the
   Zomandao River (the source of the Mangoky) possess high alpha-diversity.
   For dry forest sites, those towards the interior in relatively large
   forested areas have greater alpha-diversity measures than those of
   smaller or coastal forest sites. beta-diversity augments along the river
   systems with increasing habitat heterogeneity. The transect along the
   Soahany River has the highest beta-diversity values, indicating higher
   levels of species turnover than the other two river systems.},

Abstract = {In 2008, 90 million citizens in the United States used electronic tax
   filing to submit their federal tax returns Yet these adopters represent
   only a subset of the population Citizen concerns regarding the security
   of this electronic option still serve as a barrier to e-file adoption In
   this study, we propose a model of e-file adoption that integrates
   technology acceptance, optimism bias, reputation and perceived security
   control to explain intention to use e-filing To test the model, we
   administered a survey to over 300 taxpayers The results of structural
   equation modeling indicate that reputation and perceived security
   control have a significant impact on risk perceptions Also, perceived
   risk, performance expectancy and social influence all have a significant
   impact on intention to use an e-file system Implications for research
   and practice are discussed},

   androstadienone-chemicals that are shown to affect physiological
   responses in humans. In this study, we analyzed the in vitro function of
   OR7D4 in primate evolution. Orthologs of OR7D4 were cloned from
   different primate species. Ancestral reconstruction allowed us to
   reconstitute additional putative OR7D4 orthologs in hypothetical
   ancestral species. Functional analysis of these orthologs showed an
   extremely diverse range of OR7D4 responses to the ligands in various
   primate species. Functional analysis of the nonsynonymous changes in the
   Old World Monkey and Great Ape lineages revealed a number of sites
   causing increases or decreases in sensitivity. We found that the
   majority of the functionally important residues in OR7D4 were not
   predicted by the maximum likelihood analysis detecting positive
   Darwinian selection.},

Abstract = {In the United States, congress set a goal for 80\% tax and informational
   returns to be filed electronically in 2007(IRS, 2004). Although e-file
   adoption has grown incrementally the past, 80\% has not been reached.
   This study proposes a model of e-filing adoption that incorporates risk
   perceptions and optimism bias to explain e-file diffusion. To test the
   model we surveyed 260 taxpaying U.S. citizens. Results of a multiple
   regression analysis are consistent with our predictions; effort
   expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, perceived risk,
   and optimism bias significantly influence intention to e-file.
   Implications of results for practice and research are discussed.},

   Cryptic and Paraphyletic Species: Examples from the Diminutive
   Long-fingered Bats (Chiroptera: Miniopteridae: Miniopterus) on
   Madagascar},

Abstract = {Based on nearly complete (1125 bp) cytochrome-b sequence data and
   morphological characters, two new endemic species of Miniopterus are
   described from Madagascar that were previously identified as M. manavi.
   Using phylogenetic analysis, the basal nodes of major lineages in the
   Malagasy members of this genus are weakly supported, while, in most
   cases, the branches leading to each of the clades are well resolved.
   Miniopterus mahafaliensis, new species, occurs in the southwestern
   semidesert areas and M. brachytragos, new species, has a broad
   distribution across the northern half of the island, ranging across
   several different biomes. Phylogenetic inference indicates that these
   two new taxa are not closely related to M. manavi sensu stricto, with
   average genetic distances of 9.2\% and 5.7\% from this taxon,
   respectively. On the basis of this and previous revisions, the former M.
   manavi complex is now recognized to represent at least five taxa, which
   do not form a monophyletic group with respect to one another, and
   represent extraordinary examples of convergent evolution. Miniopterus
   brachytragos is closely related to the recently named M. aelleni, while
   M. mahafaliensis is not closely associated with any of these species.
   Molecular phylogenetic analysis was imperative to resolve the species
   limits of these taxa and morphology then provided the means to
   corroborate the recovered clades. There are localities on the island,
   specifically limestone karstic zones, where four species of the former
   M. manavi sensu lato complex occur in strict sympatry. These species
   often use the same day-roost caves and have similar external and
   craniodental measurements. This raises intriguing questions as to how
   these animals divide their worlds with regard to dietary regimes and
   foraging strategies, as well as their speciation history.},

Abstract = {Mammalian females generally carry the bulk of reproductive costs. They
   gestate for relatively long periods of time and provide the majority of
   parental care for dependent offspring. For this reason, many studies
   have examined how females deal with the energetic costs of reproduction.
   Here, we examine the influence of reproductive state on activity
   budgets, diet quality, and sociality in free-living female chimpanzees
   (Pan troglodytes) at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. After controlling
   for dominance rank, we found that pregnant and lactating females
   consumed higher quality foods than nonpregnant, nonlactating females.
   However, pregnant females also traveled less. This result did not
   reflect differences in sociality, as the pregnant female group sizes
   included in our analyses were comparable to those in other reproductive
   categories.},

Abstract = {A multidrug-resistant (MDR) clone of Plasmodium falciparum (C2A) from

Abstract = {The early evolutionary and paleobiogeographic history of the diverse
   rodent clade Hystricognathi, which contains Hystricidae (Old World
   porcupines), Caviomorpha (the endemic South American rodents), and
   African Phiomorpha (cane rats, dassie rats, and blesmols) is of great
   interest to students of mammalian evolution, but remains poorly
   understood because of a poor early fossil record. Here we describe the
   oldest well-dated hystricognathous rodents from an earliest late Eocene
   (approximate to 37 Ma) fossil locality in the Fayum Depression of
   northern Egypt. These taxa exhibit a combination of primitive and
   derived features, the former shared with Asian ``baluchimyine'' rodents,
   and the latter shared with Oligocene phiomorphs and caviomorphs.
   Phylogenetic analysis incorporating morphological, temporal, geographic,
   and molecular information places the new taxa as successive sister
   groups of crown Hystricognathi, and supports an Asian origin for stem
   Hystricognathi and an Afro-Arabian origin for crown Hystricognathi, stem
   Hystricidae, and stem Caviomorpha. Molecular dating of early divergences
   within Hystricognathi, using a Bayesian ``relaxed clock'' approach and
   multiple fossil calibrations, suggests that the split between
   Hystricidae and the phiomorph-caviomorph clade occurred approximate to
   39 Ma, and that phiomorphs and caviomorphs diverged approximate to 36
   Ma. These results are remarkably congruent with our phylogenetic results
   and the fossil record of hystricognathous rodent evolution in
   Afro-Arabia and South America.},

Title = {On the origin, homologies and evolution of primate facial muscles, with

Abstract = {The mammalian facial muscles are a subgroup of hyoid muscles (i.e.
   muscles innervated by cranial nerve VII). They are usually attached to
   freely movable skin and are responsible for facial expressions. In this
   study we provide an account of the origin, homologies and evolution of
   the primate facial muscles, based on dissections of various primate and
   non-primate taxa and a review of the literature. We provide data not
   previously reported, including photographs showing in detail the facial
   muscles of primates such as gibbons and orangutans. We show that the
   facial muscles usually present in strepsirhines are basically the same
   muscles that are present in non-primate mammals such as tree-shrews. The
   exceptions are that strepsirhines often have a muscle that is usually
   not differentiated in tree-shrews, the depressor supercilii, and lack
   two muscles that are usually differentiated in these mammals, the
   zygomatico-orbicularis and sphincter colli superficialis. Monkeys such
   as macaques usually lack two muscles that are often present in
   strepsirhines, the sphincter colli profundus and mandibulo-auricularis,
   but have some muscles that are usually absent as distinct structures in
   non-anthropoid primates, e.g. the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi,
   levator labii superioris, nasalis, depressor septi nasi, depressor
   anguli oris and depressor labii inferioris. In turn, macaques typically
   lack a risorius, auricularis anterior and temporoparietalis, which are
   found in hominoids such as humans, but have muscles that are usually not
   differentiated in members of some hominoid taxa, e.g. the platysma
   cervicale (usually not differentiated in orangutans, panins and humans)
   and auricularis posterior (usually not differentiated in orangutans).
   Based on our observations, comparisons and review of the literature, we
   propose a unifying, coherent nomenclature for the facial muscles of the
   Mammalia as a whole and provide a list of more than 300 synonyms that
   have been used in the literature to designate the facial muscles of
   primates and other mammals. A main advantage of this nomenclature is
   that it combines, and thus creates a bridge between, those names used by
   human anatomists and the names often employed in the literature dealing
   with non-human primates and non-primate mammals.},

Abstract = {New information about the early cercopithecoids Prohylobates tandyi
   (Wadi Moghra, Egypt) and Prohylobates sp. indet. (Buluk and Nabwal,
   Kenya) is presented. Comparisons are made among all major collections of
   Early and Middle Miocene catarrhine monkeys, and a systematic revision
   of the early Old World monkeys is provided. Previous work involving the
   systematics of early Old World monkeys (Victoriapithecidae;
   Cercopithecoidea) has been hampered by a number of factors, including
   the poor preservation of Prohylobates material from North Africa and
   lack of comparable anatomical parts across collections. However, it is
   now shown that basal cercopithecoid species from both northern and
   eastern Africa can be distinguished from one another on the basis of
   degree of lower molar bilophodonty, relative lower molar size, occlusal
   details, symphyseal construction, and mandibular shape. Results of
   particular interest include: 1) the first identification of features
   that unambiguously define Prohylobates relative to Victoriapithecus; 2)
   confirmation that P tandyi is incompletely bilophodont; and 3)
   recognition of additional victoriapithecid species. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Journal = {ZOOTAXA},

Abstract = {We provide a synthesis of all mammal taxa described from the African
   mainland, Madagascar and all surrounding islands in the 20 years since
   1988, thereby supplementing the earlier works of G. M. Allen (1939) and
   W. F. H. Ansell (1989), and bringing the list of African mammals
   described over the last 250 years current to December 2008. We list 175
   new extant taxa, including five new genera, one new subgenus, 138 new
   species and 31 new subspecies, including remarks, where relevant, on the
   current systematic position of each taxon. Names of seven species of
   primates are emended, according to the requirements of the ICZN. The
   taxonomic group in which the largest number of new taxa has been
   described is the Primates, with two new genera, 47 new species and 11
   new subspecies, while geographically the biggest increase in new species
   descriptions has been on the island of Madagascar, accounting for
   roughly half (67) of all new species described in the past 20 years.
   Nearly half of all new species listed currently are assessed as Data
   Deficient on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (49 of 101 listed
   species) suggesting further research is urgently needed to help clarify
   the status of those recently described species.},

Journal = {RADIO SCIENCE},

Volume = {44},
Month = {AUG 5},
Abstract = {The concept of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) has become a
   productive area of research in the field of wireless communications with
   the aim of delivering increased data throughput. However, to date, MIMO
   research has focused primarily on short-range communications within the
   VHF, UHF, and SHF bands, and very little research has been conducted
   toward exploiting MIMO techniques for long-range communications within
   the HF band. Between September 2007 and September 2008, several
   experimental campaigns were conducted to investigate the feasibility of
   applying MIMO techniques within the HF band. The results of measurements
   over a 255 km path from Durham to Leicester within the United Kingdom
   are presented in this paper with particular emphasis on the use of
   heterogeneous antenna arrays at the transmitter and receiver.},

Title = {Seasonal and social influences on fecal androgen and glucocorticoid
   excretion in wild male long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis)},
Journal = {PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {98},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {168-175},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Whereas it is well known that in strictly seasonal breeding primates
   (income breeders), alike other vertebrates, males show pronounced
   changes in testicular and adrenal hormone levels concurrent with
   reproductive activity, hormonal patterns in males of non-strictly
   seasonal breeding primate species (capital breeders) and their relation
   to seasonal and social correlates remain largely unknown. In the present
   study, we examined the annual pattern of fecal androgen and
   glucocorticoid excretion and their relationship to environmental
   (rainfall, temperature) and social factors (number of cycling females,
   male aggression and copulation rates, male dominance rank) in a group of
   wild long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis), a species with a
   moderate degree of reproductive seasonality and classified as capital
   breeder. The study was carried out in the Gunung Leuser National Park,
   North Sumatra. Indonesia over a period of ten months encompassing the
   conception and the birth season. Our results show that male long-tailed
   macaques exhibit a distinct annual variation in both androgen and
   glucocorticoid levels. Androgen (but not glucocorticoid) levels were
   significantly elevated during the conception period in association with
   elevated rates of male-male aggression and copulatory activity, both
   strongly related to the number of cycling females in the group. Neither
   glucocorticoid nor androgen levels were related to male dominance rank
   or to the environmental parameters investigated. Interestingly, levels
   of both hormones started to increase in the late birth season and thus
   1-2 months prior to the mating season, suggesting that male long-tailed
   macaques go through pre-breeding hormonal changes in preparation for
   prospective challenges. Our data thus provide the first evidence that
   males of a non-strictly seasonal breeding species/capital breeder show
   endocrine patterns generally similar to those found in strictly
   seasonal/income breeders. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Dental data from 22 Swedish brown bears (Ursus arctos) were collected
   during April and May 2008, during the annual capture of free-ranging
   brown bears in Dalarna County, Sweden by the Scandinavian Brown Bear
   Research Project. The bears were of different genders and ages. All
   animals were weighed and subjected to physical examination and all were
   found to be in good condition. The oral cavity was inspected and
   photographed and abnormalities were recorded on a dental chart. One bear
   had mild class II malocclusion. All yearlings had varying numbers of
   incompletely erupted permanent teeth. All adult bears were missing one
   or more premolars. Tooth wear increased with age; the most affected
   teeth were the incisors followed by the canines, premolars and molars.
   Complicated fractures most commonly affected the canines. Fifteen
   animals had gross evidence of enamel defects, but the aetiology of these
   was not determined. There was a low prevalence of calculus and
   periodontal disease and none of the bears had caries infections. The
   mean pH of saliva collected from these animals was 9.75. Further
   studies, based on a larger sample size followed over time, will be
   required in order to evaluate the progression of dental disease in brown
   bears. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   tropical aromatic tree species important for their antibacterial and
   antifungal medicinal qualities amongst many other functions. Many

   developed a simple and fast CTAB (cetyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide)based
   extraction protocol for routine isolation of high-quality nucleic acids.

   for PCR amplification, restriction endonuclease digestion, Southern

Title = {Attitudes, behaviors, and expectations of men seeking medical treatment
   for male pattern hair loss: results of a multinational survey},
Journal = {CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {25},
Number = {7},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objectivs: The study's objectives were to characterize the concerns and
   self-treating efforts of men seeking medical treatment for male pattern
   hair loss (MPHL) and to describe expectations and actual experiences of
   a physician consultation.
   Methods: The online survey in six countries (United States, France,
   Germany, Spain, Japan and Korea) involved 604 men (25-49 years old)
   self-identifying with MPHL.
   Results: Approximately 75\% of the study's treatment-seeking men were
   concerned, very concerned, or extremely concerned about their hair loos
   96\% were at leat some-what concerned. This high level of concern
   translated into multiple information seeking actions (53.9\% reported
   two or three actions; 24.85 reported four or five actions) and multiple
   self-treatments prior to physician consultation. Only 16\% of the sample
   had not tried and treatment. Many treatment-motivated men with MPHL were
   uncomfortable (21\%) or only moderately comfortable (37\%) consulting
   with a physician and delayed this consultation. Factors motivating men
   with MPHL to consult a physician induced a concern about worsening hair
   loss (82\%), a desire to benefit from physicians' treatment expertise
   (85\%) or physician-prescribed products (75\%), and dissatisfaction with
   non-prescription products (73\%). Expectations for the physician's
   treatment actions were met less often than was desired, resulting in
   dissatisfaction among one-fourth of the men. Dissatisfaction stemmed
   from lack of specific treatment recommendations (66\%), unanswered
   questions (54\%), and a perception that the doctor was uncomfortable or
   uninterested in discussing their hair loss (52\%). Potential study
   limitations included self-identification of MPHL, reliance on
   respondents' recall, and a lack of verification of professed future
   physician consultations.
   Conclusions: The typical man seeking MPHL treatment has significant
   concerns about the condition and has already in considerable efforts to
   obtain information and to self-treat. Individualized consideration of
   attitudes, concerns, self-treating efforts, and expectations is crucial
   for effective management of men seeking medical treatment for MPHL.},

Abstract = {We are developing a radiation attenuated Plasmodium falciparum
   sporozoite (PfSPZ) malaria vaccine. An important step was to determine
   the minimum dose of irradiation required to adequately attenuate each
   sporozoite. This was studied in the Plasm odium yoelii rodent model
   system. Exposure to 100 Gy completely attenuated P. yoelii sporozoites
   (PySPZ). Next we demonstrated that immunization of mice intravenously
   with 3 doses of 750 PySPZ that had received 200 Gy, double the radiation
   dose required for attenuation, resulted in 100\% protection. These
   results support the contention that a radiation attenuated sporozoite
   vaccine for malaria will be safe and effective at a range of radiation
   doses. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The pharmaceutical industry, particularly the small molecule domain,
   faces unprecedented challenges of escalating costs, high attrition as
   well as increasing competitive pressure from other companies and from
   new treatment modes such as biological products. In other industries,
   process improvement approaches, such as Lean Sigma, have delivered
   benefits in speed, quality and cost of delivery. Examining the medicinal
   chemistry contributions to the iterative improvement process of
   design-make-test-analyse from a Lean Sigma perspective revealed that
   major improvements could be made. Thus, the cycle times of synthesis, as
   well as compound analysis and purification, were reduced dramatically.
   Improvements focused on team, rather than individual, performance. These
   new ways of working have consequences for staff engagement, goals,
   rewards and motivation, which are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Different applications of radio systems are based on the implementation
   of antenna arrays. Classically, radio direction finding operates with a
   multi channel receiving system connected to an array of receiving
   antennas. More recently, MIMO architectures have been proposed to
   increase the capacity of radio links by the use of antenna arrays at
   both the transmitter and receiver.
   The first part of this paper describes some novel experimental work
   carried out to examine the feasibility of applying MIMO techniques for
   communications within the HF radio band. A detailed correlation analysis
   of a variety of different antenna array configurations is presented. The
   second section of the paper also deals with HF MIMO Communications,
   focusing on the problem from a modelling point of view. The third part
   presents a sensitivity analysis of different antenna array structures
   for HF direction finding applications. The results demonstrate that when
   modelling errors, heterogeneous antenna arrays are more robust in
   comparison to homogeneous structures.},

Abstract = {We investigated long-term site fidelity of gray-cheeked mangabey
   (Lophocebus albigena) groups in Kibale National Park, Uganda.
   Concurrently, we monitored shifts in home range by individual females
   and subadult and adult males. We documented home range stability by
   calculating the area of overlap in successive years, and by recording
   the drift of each group's monthly centroid from its initial location.
   Home ranges remained stable for 3 of our 4 groups (overlap over 10 yr >
   60\%). Core areas were more labile, but group centroids drifted an
   average of only 530 m over the entire decade. Deviations from site
   fidelity were associated with dispersal or group fission. During natal
   dispersal, subadult males expanded their home ranges over many months,
   settling a parts per thousand currency sign4 home ranges away. Adult
   males, in contrast, typically dispersed within a few days to an adjacent
   group in an area of home range overlap. Adult males made solitary
   forays, but nearly always into areas used by their current group or by a
   group to which they had previously belonged. After secondary dispersal,
   they expanded their ranging in the company of their new group,
   apparently without prior solitary exploration of the new area. Some
   females also participated in home range shifts. Females shifted home
   ranges only within social groups, in association with temporary or
   permanent group splits. Our observations raise the possibility that male
   mangabeys use a finder-joiner mechanism when moving into new home ranges
   during secondary dispersal. Similarly, females might learn new resource
   locations from male immigrants before or during group fission.},

Title = {Mate-Guarding as a Male Reproductive Tactic in Propithecus verreauxi},

Abstract = {Sexual selection theory predicts that in group-living mammals, male
   reproductive tactics can lead to high reproductive skew in favor of
   dominant individuals. In sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), a group-living
   primate with extremely seasonal reproduction, male reproductive success
   is highly skewed because dominant males sire almost all offspring
   despite a tendency toward an even adult group sex ratio. To understand
   the underlying behavioral mechanism resulting in this rank-related
   reproductive skew in male sifakas, we studied mate-guarding as a
   potential reproductive tactic. Behavioral observations of dominant males
   and adult females in combination with hormonal determination of timing
   of female receptivity in 9 groups at Kirindy Forest revealed that
   dominant males spent more time in proximity to females when they were
   receptive and were responsible for the maintenance of this proximity.
   Results also indicated that monopolization of receptive females was
   facilitated by both estrous asynchrony within groups and by the ability
   of dominant males to obtain olfactory cues as to the timing of female
   receptivity. Although dominant males engaging in mate-guarding are
   expected to experience various costs, there was no evidence for
   decreased foraging behavior and only a trend toward increased aggression
   between dominant and subordinate non-natal males within groups. Our
   results are in accordance with the hypothesis that dominant males use
   mate-guarding to monopolize receptive females and that it is one
   proximate mechanism that contributes to the high reproductive skew
   observed within the population of male sifakas at Kirindy.},

Abstract = {The responses of plural breeding mammals to environmental stressors are
   little understood in free-ranging populations, but recent studies of
   singular breeders suggest that ecological factors and social milieu
   influence the variable physiological stress responses observed among
   individuals. Our previous studies examining faecal glucocorticoid
   (fGC)-behaviour interactions in plural breeding male sifaka (Propithecus
   verreauxi) show that fGC elevations coincide with specific dispersal
   events, particularly the eviction of subordinates by resident alpha
   males. This study examined the utility of fGC assays for assessing the
   stress responses of male sifaka to demographic changes in the population
   during the birth season. Analyses were based on 889 faecal samples
   collected over five birth seasons from 124 adult males residing in 55
   different groups at Beza Mahafaly, Madagascar. Results show that fGC
   levels in males are unrelated to age, residence, group stability or
   rank, but are significantly and positively correlated with the presence
   of infants, annual elevations in weekly mean fGC concentrations in males
   paralleling increasing numbers of infants born annually in the
   population. These data are the first to show that in seasonal plural
   breeding species such as sifaka, elevated fGC in males reflects specific
   events related to reproduction rather than states or social context
   during the birth season.},

Abstract = {Adiponectin has been reported to regulate systemic insulin sensitivity
   as a part of a broader control mechanism in energy balance. However, it
   is not clear whether adiponectin exerts its positive effects insulin
   sensitivity equally in a wide range of obesity. We investigated the
   association of plasma adiponectin concentration with insulin resistance
   (W) in a cross-sectional sample of 98 middle-aged premenopausal women
   with a wide range of obesity. In addition, We studied the relationship
   between adiponectin, body composition, and blood biochemical and
   cardiorespiratory fitness variables. Body composition and fiat
   distribution were measured via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in
   normal-weight (NW) (n = 41, body mass index {[}BMI] <25 kg/m(2)) and
   overweight (OW) (n = 57, BMI >= 25 kg/m(2)) women. Fasting blood samples
   were obtained adiponectin, leptin, insulin, glucose, and insulin-like
   growth factor-I were measured; and IR index was calculated. The IR index
   from fasting plasma insulin and plasma (glucose levels was estimated
   using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), as follows: fasting
   plasma insulin (in microliter units per milliliter) x tasting plasma
   glucose (in millimoles per liter)/ 22.5. Adiponectin was significantly
   higher (P = .0001) in NW (14.7 +/- 4.7 mu g/mL) compared with OW (9.9
   +/- 3.1 mu g/mL) women. Significant differences (P <.003) in body mass,
   BMI, percentage of fat mass, fat mass, trunk fat, trunk fat-leg fat
   ratio, leptin, insulin, and HOMA were also observed between NW and OW
   groups. Leptin was independently related to plasma adiponectin (beta =
   -.259, P = .001) in the overall study group. Plasma adiponectin was only
   related to trunk fat-leg fat ratio (beta = -.242 P = .002) among NW
   subjects, whereas plasma adiponectin was related to fat-free mass (beta
   = .182, P = -.0001) and HOMA (beta = -.576 P = .002) among OW women. The
   inverse relationship between adiponectin and leptin concentrations
   suggests that leptin may be involved in the regulation of adiponectin in
   middle-aged premenopausal women. Our data also demonstrate that
   adiponectin may play an important role in sustaining insulin sensitivity
   only in OW middle-aged premenopausal women. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Numerous studies in group-living animals with stable compositions have
   demonstrated the complex and dynamic nature of social behaviour.
   Empirical studies occasionally provide principles that cannot be applied
   directly to other group-living species. Because of this, researchers are
   required to address fine-scaled conceptual questions and to incorporate
   species-specific characteristics of the study species. In this paper, I
   raise three key topics that will promote our understanding of animal
   sociality: the effects of heterogeneous social relationships on the
   pattern, distribution, and function of social interactions; conflict
   management for maintaining group living; and meta-dyad-level
   perspectives for understanding dyadic social relationships and
   behaviours. Through the discussion of these topics together with
   examples of group-living mammals, I emphasise the importance of direct
   behavioural observations and functional analyses in studies of species-
   or taxonomic-group-specific characteristics of social behaviour in a
   wide range of taxonomic groups. In addition to approaches focusing on
   specificity, another approach that examines the general principles or
   common characteristics found across different taxonomic groups could
   provide synthetic and reductive frameworks to understand divergent
   sociality. The complementary use of these two approaches will offer a
   comprehensive understanding of social evolution in group-living animals.},

Abstract = {We present the first demonstration of oral transmission of Trypanosoma
   cruzi to raccoons (Procyon lotor), a natural reservoir host in the
   United States, by ingestion of trypomastigotes and infected bugs. but
   not infected tissue. To investigate an alternative, non-vector-bused
   transmission method, we tested the hypothesis that raccoons scavenging
   on infected hosts results in patent infection. Macerated tissue from
   selected organs infected with amastigote stages of T. cruzi was orally
   administered to experimental groups of raccoons (n = 2/group) at 2, 12,
   or 24 In after collection of the tissue samples. Additionally, raccoons
   (n = I) in control groups were inoculated intravenously or per os with
   trypomastigotes. To further elucidate transmission routes of T. cruzi to
   raccoons, infected Rhodnius prolixus were fed to raccoons (n = 2).
   Raccoons did not become infected after ingestion of amastigote-infected
   tissues as evidenced by negative polymerase chain reaction results from
   blood and tissue, lack of seroconversion, and negative parasitemias.
   However. per os transmission can occur by ingestion of the infective
   trypomastigote stage or infected reduviid bugs. We conclude from these
   findings that oral transmission of T. cruzi may he a route of infection
   for wildlife in sylvatic cycles, but the scavenging behavior of animals
   is not likely;1 Significant transmission route.},

Abstract = {While much can be learned about primates by means of observation, the
   slow life history of many primates means that even decades of dedicated
   effort cannot illuminate long-term evolutionary processes. For example,
   while the size of a contemporary population can be estimated from field
   censuses, it is often desirable to know whether a population has been
   constant or changing in size over a time frame of hundreds or thousands
   of years. Even the nature of ``a population{''} is open to question, and
   the extent to which individuals successfully disperse among defined
   populations is also difficult to estimate by using observational methods
   alone. Researchers have thus turned to genetic methods to examine the
   size, structure, and evolutionary histories of primate populations. Many
   results have been gained by study of sequence variation of maternally
   inherited mitochondrial DNA, but in recent years researchers have been
   increasingly focusing on analysis of short, highly variable
   microsatellite segments in the autosomal genome for a high-resolution
   view of evolutionary processes involving both sexes. In this review we
   describe some of the insights thus gained, and discuss the likely impact
   on this field of new technologies such as high-throughput DNA
   sequencing.},

Abstract = {Many taxa, including dung beetles, exhibit small-scale microendemism in
   Madagascar, which has contributed to the high level of species'
   diversity on the island. Species in the genus Nanos are numerically
   dominant in the dung beetle communities in rainforests in eastern
   Madagascar, but typically just one species occurs in any one locality.
   The two northern species, N. clypeatus and N. dubitatus, cannot be
   distinguished by either a mitochondrial or a nuclear genetic marker
   (cytochrome oxidase subunit I and internal transcription spacer 2). One
   population of the southern N. viettei is genetically highly divergent,
   although morphologically indistinguishable. Genetic data indicate that
   introgression occurred from N. dubitatus to N. viettei 1-2 Mya, and
   these species may continue to hybridize. Complex genetic patterns have
   mostly evolved within the last 2 Myr. During this time, the glacial
   cycles in the northern hemisphere were reflected in the oscillating
   climatic conditions in Africa, which repeatedly fragmented and re-united
   the rainforests in eastern Madagascar, possibly leading to the observed
   complex phylogeographical patterns in Nanos. (C) 2009 The Linnean

Abstract = {Larval settlement is a vital transition period for marine invertebrates
   and can have far-reaching effects on the ecology and evolution of a
   species. To explore the molecular mechanisms of this critical process in
   a nonmodel organism, the abalone Haliotis asinina, we employed cDNA
   microarrays. By comparing gene expression profiles through mid- to late
   larval development and metamorphosis, we identified 144 genes as
   candidates for a role in competence and/or metamorphosis. Gene
   characterization indicates similar to 60\% of these are significantly
   similar to known genes from other taxa, while similar to 40\% are novel.
   A high 49.3\% of genes are gastropod or abalone specific, but none
   appears to be Lophotrochozoan specific, even though metamorphosis is
   thought to have had a separate origin in this group. Differentially
   expressed larval and postlarval genes can be clustered into five
   categories that reveal strikingly different temporal transcriptional
   patterns occurring during this phase of development. Some gene
   activation is contingent upon exogenous cues and correlates with
   initiation of settlement. Importantly, there is also extensive gene
   activity associated with the endogenous attainment of competence, which
   occurs before, and independent of, the exogenous induction of
   settlement. Our results show that as the haliotid veliger larva matures,
   it requires coordinated regulation of temporally different batteries of
   genes involved in a wide range of physiological and developmental
   processes associated with benthic colonization. Although the signalling
   pathways operating at metamorphosis may be conserved across the animal
   kingdom, it appears they regulate the expression of novel genes specific
   to abalone, gastropods and molluscs during H. asinina metamorphosis.},

Abstract = {Health and disease are critical factors for understanding primate
   evolution and for developing effective conservation and management
   strategies. However, comprehensive health assessments of wild primate
   populations are rare, in part because of the difficulty and risk of
   chemically immobilizing subjects to obtain the necessary biological
   samples. We report here the results of a health assessment, as well as
   the methods and drug dosages used to capture white-faced capuchins
   (Cebus capucinus) on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We captured and
   measured 24 capuchins as part of an ongoing radiotelemetry study, and
   collected biological samples from 9 of them for a comprehensive health
   survey. TelazolA (R) was very effective for immobilizing and capturing
   capuchins, although the doses we used were higher than those recommended
   for captive capuchins. High Telazol doses immobilized individuals
   quickly, ensuring that we were able to find and recover the sedated
   monkeys. The capuchins were generally in good condition, and had few
   ecto-, hemo-, or intestinal parasites. However, all but 1 of the adults
   had substantial dental abnormalities. In addition, 1 juvenile had
   indeterminate genitalia that we believe to be the result of hypospadias.
   Seven of the capuchins tested positive for exposure to Herpesvirus
   tamarinus and all individuals tested positive for exposure to Cebus
   cytomegalovirus. Hematology, serum chemistry, and plasma mineral levels
   from the wild individuals were, for the most part, comparable to those
   recorded for captive Cebus capucinus, and contribute to establishing
   baseline health values for the species.},

Journal = {ANNUAL REVIEW OF ANTHROPOLOGY},
Series = {Annual Review of Anthropology},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {115-130},
Abstract = {Among primates, intense paternal care is manifested in only a few
   distantly related species, including humans. Thus, neither purely
   phylogenetic nor socioecological hypotheses can explain its presence or
   the variability in the expression of paternal behaviors. Traditional
   theoretical models for the evolution of paternal care can now be
   reexamined, focusing on male-female interactions as a possible key to
   understanding parental strategies. At a proximate level, the existing
   evidence implies a common physiological substrate for both paternal
   behavior and pairbonds. Vasopressin, and perhaps prolactin and
   testosterone, apparently underlies the endocrinological bases of
   paternal care, and neuroanatomical reward pathways may be involved in
   the formation of attachment bonds. Understanding of the genetic
   structure of primate populations and the neurogenetics of social
   behavior is also emerging. A multidisciplinary approach that also
   considers epigenetic and transgenerational effects promises to open new
   avenues to explain the flexible nature of paternal care in primates.},

Abstract = {Vampyravus orientalis, from the Oligocene of Fayum, Egypt was the first
   fossil bat described from Africa. It is represented by a single,
   relatively large humerus from an unknown horizon in the Jebel Qatram
   Formation Based on regression analyses of skeletal proportions of modern
   bats, we developed a set of equations to estimate body mass of fossil
   bats from known skeletal elements in order to test the hypothesis that
   Vampyravus could have been within the body size range or other Fayum
   bats, including several recently described taxa from the Jebel Qatrani
   and underlying Birket Qarun Formations. Our findings indicate that only
   Witwatia could have had a body mass similar to Vampyravus Witwatia is
   known only from Quarry BQ-2 (Late Eocene, Priabonian) in the Birket
   Qarun Formation Therefore Vampyravus is between 2 and 7 million years
   younger, depending on where within the Jebel Qatrani Formation it was
   found Also, a recently discovered distal humerus of Witwatia from BQ-2
   demonstrates that this taxon differs substantially from Vampyravus in
   comparable morphology Vampyravus is distinct from all other Fayum fossil
   bats Vampyravus shares characteristics of the proximal and distal
   humerus with several extant bat groups including phyllostomids, some
   rhinolophoids, natalids, emballonurids, and rhinopomatids The latter two
   families are represented by fossil forms in the Fayum Although
   Vampyravus is much larger than either the Fayum emballonurid or
   rhinopomatid, relatively large size typifies many taxa representing
   modern bat groups in the Fayum, making it all the more conceivable that
   Vampyravus could belong to one of these families},

Abstract = {Health care providers' opinions can influence how parents place their
   infant to sleep. Neonatal nurses can improve how they teach and model
   safe infant sleep practices to parents. To increase neonatal nurses'
   knowledge, a sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) prevention program was
   implemented. Program components included a computerized teaching tool, a
   crib card, sleep sacks, and discharge instructions. Initial program
   evaluation showed that 98 percent of infants slept supine and 93 percent
   slept in sleep sacks in open cribs. However, nurses continued to swaddle
   some infants with blankets to improve thermoregulation. To increase
   nursing compliance in modeling safe infant sleep practices, Halo
   SleepSack Swaddles were provided for nurses to use in place of a blanket
   to regulate infant temperature. Recent data show that 100 percent of
   infants in open cribs are now sleeping supine wearing a Halo Swaddle or
   a traditional Halo SleepSack. This model program can easily be
   replicated to enhance neonatal nurses' knowledge about SIDS prevention.},

   140 clones from a genomic library were examined and 38 potential loci
   tested across both closely and distantly related lizards. Of the 18 loci
   reported here, more than half (10) work in closely related zonosaurines
   although only one successfully amplified a homologous fragment in the
   distantly related iguanid (Oplurus). Sequences of these loci revealed a
   high frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms, supporting previous
   reports of high levels of intraspecific variation in lizards.},

Abstract = {Under the dispersal/foraging efficiency model, colobines are predicted
   to be `indifferent mothers', neither facilitating philopatry for their
   daughters nor evicting them from the natal home range because food
   competition is thought to be slight. We observed six groups of Colobus
   vellerosus at the Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary in Ghana (2000-2007)
   and recorded changes in female composition caused by observed (N = 11)
   and inferred (N = 12) emigrations and immigrations (N = 3). We also
   observed 14 immigration attempts. Most emigrating females were subadult
   and nulliparous. Parallel emigration was frequent. Resident females
   behaved aggressively to immigrating females and immigration attempts
   were rarely successful. Voluntary female emigration (N = 10) occurred
   mostly when male group membership was unstable or in association with
   the immigration of all-male bands. Involuntary emigrations (N = 13)
   associated with increased female-female aggression occurred in the two
   largest groups, where parous females targeted nulliparous maturing
   females. Larger groups tended to lose females and female immigration was
   successful only in the study group with the lowest number of females.
   Females appear to emigrate to reduce infanticide threat although feeding
   competition is reduced in smaller groups as well. C. vellerosus at BFMS
   are better described as `incomplete suppressors'.},

Title = {Mandibular corpus bone strain in goats and alpacas: Implications for
   understanding the biomechanics of mandibular form in selenodont
   artiodactyls},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANATOMY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {214},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-78},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The goal of this study is to clarify the functional and biomechanical
   relationship between jaw morphology and in vivo masticatory loading in
   selenodont artiodactyls. We compare in vivo strains from the mandibular
   corpus of goats and alpacas to predicted strain patterns derived from
   biomechanical models for mandibular corpus loading during mastication.
   Peak shear strains in both species average 600-700 mu epsilon on the
   working side and approximately 450 mu epsilon on the balancing side.
   Maximum principal tension in goats and alpacas is directed at
   approximately 30 degrees dorsocaudally relative to the long axis of the
   corpus on the working side and approximately perpendicular to the long
   axis on the balancing side. Strain patterns in both species indicate
   primarily torsion of the working-side corpus about the long axis and
   parasagittal bending and/or lateral transverse bending of the
   balancing-side corpus. Interpretation of the strain patterns is
   consistent with comparative biomechanical analyses of jaw morphology
   suggesting that in goats, the balancing-side mandibular corpus is
   parasagittally bent whereas in alpacas it experiences lateral transverse
   bending. However, in light of higher working-side corpus strains,
   biomechanical explanations of mandibular form also need to consider that
   torsion influences relative corpus size and shape. Furthermore, the
   complex combination of loads that occur along the selenodont artiodactyl
   mandibular corpus during the power stroke has two implications. First,
   added clarification of these loading patterns requires in vivo
   approaches for elucidating biomechanical links between mandibular corpus
   morphology and masticatory loading. Second, morphometric approaches may
   be limited in their ability to accurately infer masticatory loading
   regimes of selenodont artiodactyl jaws.},

Abstract = {Tree shrews are small mammals living in the tropical forest of Southeast
   Asia. The habitus of species within the genus Tupaia is often quite
   similar, so that it is difficult to differentiate the species based on
   their morphology. We applied comparative bioacoustics, a tool
   successfully used to discriminate cryptic species of nocturnal mammals,
   to investigate whether species in the diurnal genus Tupaia can be
   recognized noninvasively on the basis of a conspicuous loud call, the
   chatter. We studied to what extent the chatter call of 2 tree shrew
   species, Tupaia glis and T. belangeri, differed in acoustic structure.
   We also acoustically analyzed the chatter call of T. chinensis, a
   subspecies or closely related parapatric species of T. belangeri.
   Analyzed acoustic features allowed assigning chatter calls with a
   probability of more than 73\% to the species that produced them.
   Bioacoustical differences are in line with subtle morphological
   differences, supporting species status for all 3 studied tree shrew
   species and corroborating immunodiffusion and genetic data that
   differentiate T. glis and T. belangeri. Loud calls may offer a reliable
   noninvasive tool for species diagnosis and discrimination in cryptic
   species of this diurnal mammalian group.},

Abstract = {Many proteins necessary for sound transduction have been identified
   through positional cloning of genes that cause deafness(1-3). We report
   here that mutations of LRTOMT are associated with profound nonsyndromic
   hearing loss at the DFNB63 locus on human chromosome 11q13.3-q13.4.
   LRTOMT has two alternative reading frames and encodes two different
   proteins, LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2, detected by protein blot analyses.
   LRTOMT2 is a putative methyltransferase. During evolution, new
   transcripts can arise through partial or complete coalescence of
   genes(4). We provide evidence that in the primate lineage LRTOMT evolved
   from the fusion of two neighboring ancestral genes, which exist as
   separate genes (Lrrc51 and Tomt) in rodents.},

Abstract = {Three species of boid snakes are recognized in Madagascar, namely the
   genus Sanzinia (one species and two subspecies) and the genus
   Acrantophis (two species). In the present study, we studied the patterns
   of genetic variation of these species across Madagascar using a fragment
   of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene in 77 specimens. To support the
   phylogenetic relationships of the lineages identified, three further
   gene fragments (cytochrome b, 12S rRNA and c-mos) were analyzed in a
   reduced but representative set of samples. The results obtained
   corroborate that the genus Sanzinia includes two highly divergent
   mitochondrial lineages that evolved independently from each other on the
   east versus the west side of Madagascar. Each of these lineages presents
   a further subdivision that separates northern from southern groups. The
   nuclear marker showed no variation among the Malagasy boas, indicating
   either very low substitution rates in this gene or relatively recent
   speciation events coupled with high mitochondrial substitution rates.
   Because the broad geographic sampling detected no admixture among
   haplotypic lineages within Sanzinia, it is hypothesized that these may
   represent distinct species. Deviant haplotypes of snakes morphologically
   similar to Acrantophis dumerili indicate that this taxon may be a
   complex of two species as well. (c) 2008 The Linnean Society of London,

Title = {Female reproductive synchrony predicts skewed paternity across primates},

Abstract = {Recent studies have uncovered remarkable variation in paternity within
   primate groups. To date, however, we lack a general understanding of the
   factors that drive variation in paternity skew among primate groups and
   across species. Our study focused on hypotheses from reproductive skew
   theory involving limited control and the use of paternity
   ``concessions{''} by investigating how paternity covaries with the
   number of males, female estrous synchrony, and rates of extragroup
   paternity. In multivariate and phylogenetically controlled analyses of
   data from 27 studies on 19 species, we found strong support for a
   limited control skew model, with reproductive skew within groups
   declining as female reproductive synchrony and the number of males per
   group increase. Of these 2 variables, female reproductive synchrony
   explained more of the variation in paternity distributions. To test
   whether dominant males provide incentives to subordinates to resist
   matings by extragroup males, that is, whether dominants make concessions
   of paternity, we derived a novel prediction that skew is lower within
   groups when threat from outside the group exists. This prediction was
   not supported as a primary factor underlying patterns of reproductive
   skew among primate species. However, our approach revealed that if
   concessions occur in primates, they are most likely when female
   synchrony is low, as these conditions provide alpha male control of
   paternity that is assumed by concessions models. Collectively, our
   analyses demonstrate that aspects of male reproductive competition are
   the primary drivers of reproductive skew in primates.},

Abstract = {Three decades of systematic observations provided evidence that
   peacemaking, like aggression, is a natural aspect of primate social
   behaviour. Inspired by the work on non-human primates, researchers in
   the USA, Europe, and Japan set Out to investigate peacemaking in young
   children, using the methods of observation developed for peacemaking
   research on non-human primates. The findings from these early child
   studies suggest that across cultures young children show peacemaking
   that is remarkably similar in form and timing as has been observed in
   non-human primates. In this paper I compare and contrast the main
   findings from the early child Studies with some of the key findings of
   the non-human primate work. I present this comparative evidence of
   natural peace processes within the context of the ethology of peace. I
   propose an operational definition of peace and discuss the various
   themes within the processes of peace that can be investigated based on
   this proposed multilevel definition. I also present specific ideas for
   future research and collaboration with related disciplines. In
   conclusion I argue that peace ethology is uniquely positioned to make an
   important contribution toward our understanding of how proximate and
   ultimate factors combine to bring about and constrain peace.},

Title = {Female-Biased Dispersal and Gene Flow in a Behaviorally Monogamous
   Mammal, the Large Treeshrew (Tupaia tana)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {3},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 17},
Abstract = {Background: Female-biased dispersal (FBD) is predicted to occur in
   monogamous species due to local resource competition among females, but
   evidence for this association in mammals is scarce. The predicted
   relationship between FBD and monogamy may also be too simplistic, given
   that many pair-living mammals exhibit substantial extra-pair paternity.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: I examined whether dispersal and gene
   flow are female-biased in the large treeshrew (Tupaia tana) in Borneo, a
   behaviorally monogamous species with a genetic mating system
   characterized by high rates (50\%) of extra-pair paternity. Genetic
   analyses provided evidence of FBD in this species. As predicted for FBD,
   I found lower mean values for the corrected assignment index for adult
   females than for males using seven microsatellite loci, indicating that
   female individuals were more likely to be immigrants. Adult female pairs
   were also less related than adult male pairs. Furthermore, comparison of
   Bayesian coalescent-based estimates of migration rates using maternally
   and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers suggested that gene flow is
   female-biased in T. tana. The effective number of migrants between
   populations estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequence was three times
   higher than the number estimated using autosomal microsatellites.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results provide the first evidence of
   FBD in a behaviorally monogamous species without mating fidelity. I
   argue that competition among females for feeding territories creates a
   sexual asymmetry in the costs and benefits of dispersal in treeshrews.},

Abstract = {E-government diffusion is an international phenomenon. This study
   compares e-government adoption in the U.K. to adoption in the U.S. In
   particular, this study seeks to determine if the same factors are
   salient in both countries. Several studies have explored citizen
   acceptance of e-government services in the U.S. However, few studies
   have explored this phenomenon in the U.K. To identify the similarities
   and differences between the U.K. and the U.S. a survey is conducted in
   the U.K. and the findings are compared to the literature that
   investigates diffusion in the U.S. This study proposes a model of
   e-government adoption in the U.K. based on salient factors in the U.S. A
   survey is administered to 260 citizens in London to assess the
   importance of relative advantage, trust and the digital divide on
   intention to use e-government. The results of binary logistic regression
   indicate that there are cultural differences in e-government adoption in
   the U.K. and the U.S. The results indicate that of the prevailing
   adoption constructs, relative advantage and trust are pertinent in both
   the U.S. and the U.K., while ICT adoption barriers such as access and
   skill may vary by culture. Implications for research and practice are
   discussed.},

   100-222 (NRP) and 501-596 repeat peptides induced effector B- and T-cell
   responses in terms of antigen-driven antibodies and/or specific

   were protected following immunization with either the NRP region alone
   or the NRP combined with the R2 repeat region, as compared with controls

Abstract = {The patterns of heterothermy were measured in Lesser Hedgehog Tenrecs,
   Echinops telfairi, under semi-natural conditions in an outdoor enclosure
   during the austral mid-winter in southwestern Madagascar. The animals
   were implanted with miniaturized body temperature (T-b) loggers
   (iButtons) that measured body temperature every 42 min for 2 months (May
   and June). The tenrecs entered daily torpor on all 60 consecutive days
   of measurement, that is, on 100\% of animal days, with body temperature
   closely tracking ambient temperature (T-a) during the ambient heating
   phase. The mean minimum daily T-b of the tenrecs was 18.44 +/- 0.50
   degrees C (n = 174, N = 3), and never exceeded 25 degrees C whereas,
   apart from a few hibernation bouts in one animal, the mean maximum daily
   T (b) was 30.73 +/- 0.15 degrees C (n = 167, N = 3). Thus during winter,
   tenrecs display the lowest normothermic T (b) of all placental mammals.
   E. telfairi showed afternoon and early evening arousals, but entered
   torpor before midnight and remained in torpor for 12-18 h each day. One
   animal hibernated on two occasions for periods of 2-4 days. We consider
   E. telfairi to be a protoendotherm, and discuss the relevance and
   potential of these data for testing models on the evolution of
   endothermy.},

Title = {Formal submission, tolerance and socioecological models: a test with

Abstract = {Patterns of agonistic relationships among group-living mammalian females
   are suggested to reflect differences in feeding competition.
   Socioecological models predict that within-group contest (WGC)
   competition leads to despotic relationships that are linear, consistent,
   and stable, in which subordinate individuals use formal submission to
   acknowledge rank. Between-group contest ( BGC) competition and risk of
   infanticide are predicted to add tolerance, as evidenced by frequent
   reconciliation, low-intensity aggression and counteraggression. We
   examined the predicted effects for formal submission and two criteria of
   tolerance for a group of Hanuman langurs ( Semnopithecus entellus) in a
   population known to experience WGC and BGC as well as high rates of
   infanticide. Results were based on focal animal sampling of eight of 13
   adult females ( 419 h) and ad libitum sampling of all 13 females ( 711
   contact hours) in the group Kailana I ( Jodhpur, India). The behaviour
   `presenting' ( N= 281) qualified as formal submission, adhering to most
   proposed criteria ( e. g. linear, consistent, predictive of other
   agonistic relationships and hierarchies, 40.9\% spontaneous). Thus,
   regarding formal submission, the predicted effects of WGC hold, and
   support the explanatory value of this aspect of socioecological models.
   In contrast, agonistic relationships were nontolerant, with frequent
   high-intensity aggression ( 48.9\% of N= 231) and almost no
   counteraggression (< 1\%). This suggests that either the criteria used
   in assessing BGC require reconsideration or the predicted effects of BGC
   on tolerance should be revisited. The latter adds to growing evidence of
   BGC as a weak predictor of within-group relationships. (c) 2008 The

Abstract = {Businesses involved in logistics and supply chain management rely on
   information technology to deliver services ``on time{''} with highest

   capabilities and diversified its mission to become The O-J Group, a
   multi-service transportation and logistics enterprise. Strategically
   seizing opportunities, the CEO in 1998 expanded the company to become a
   global supplier to the automotive divisions whose mission is to optimize
   the customer's supply chain infrastructures and processes by designing
   and implementing complex supply chain solutions and leverag-ing
   information technology to reduce costs and improve service. This study
   assesses the diffusion of information technology within the compnay by

Abstract = {Citizen confidence in government and technology is imperative to the

   disposition to trust, trust of the Internet (TOI), trust of the
   government (TOG) and perceived risk. Results from a citizen survey
   indicate that disposition to trust positively affects TOI and TOG, which
   in turn affect intentions to use an e-government service. TOG also
   affects negatively perceived risk, which affects use intentions as well.

Title = {Contexts of rubbing behavior in Alouatta guariba clamitans: A

Year = {2008},
Volume = {70},
Number = {6},
Pages = {575-583},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Rubbing behaviors are well known in several primate species and are
   usually seen as scent-marking behaviors, with several functions proposed
   but still widely debated. The genus Alouatta is highly sexually
   dimorphic and a suitable subject for the study of sexual and
   hierarchical divergences associated with rubbing behavior: males should
   mark more than females, and dominant individuals more than subordinate
   ones. Three wild groups of Southern brown howler monkeys, Alouatta
   guariba clamitans, were studied at Morro Geisler, Indaial, Brazil, from
   September 2004 to February 2005. One hundred and twenty-three rubbing
   episodes were registered; data on performers and associated contexts
   showed that anogenital, dorsum and hyoid regions were the most often
   rubbed. Adult males rubbed significantly above expected levels, whereas
   subordinated females and juveniles tended to rub below the expected
   levels. Females were the main performers of anogenital rubbing, often
   preceded by defecation. The predominance of rubbing in males probably
   serves an important function in intrasexual communication and social
   interactions. Intrasexual competition can also lead to a relationship
   between rubbing and social status in females. Hyoid and sternum rubbing
   by males are probably agonistic signals associated with extragroup
   conflict. The possible cleaning function of anogenital rubbing does not
   preclude a communicative function. Whether rubbing behavior in howlers
   is solely for the function of scent marking or can also be a visual
   signal (e.g. as a display or to color the substrate with pigment)
   requires further study.},

Abstract = {Eulemur fulvus rufus has been described as having stable
   multi-male/multi-female groups, a male-biased sex ratio, and female
   philopatry. However, in a 16-year study of this subspecies we documented
   a great deal of demographic change as several groups permanently
   fissioned, some groups disappeared, and new groups formed. We split the
   dataset into two periods, 1988 to 1993 and 1994 to 2003, which coincided
   with the first disappearance of a study group (in August 1994) and the
   first permanent group fission (in December 1994). The average group size
   decreased by nearly half between the study periods (10.5-5.6), while the
   frequency of group membership changes increased (2.0-8.3 times/year),
   and the birth rate decreased (0.56-0.38). Females, as well as males,
   immigrated into study groups and transferred between groups, something
   that has been rarely seen in this subspecies. We also found a
   significant decline in the amount of fruit from the earliest part of the
   study to the latter part of the study. Study groups did not switch to
   other types of foods during periods of fruit shortage, but traveled
   outside of their home range areas more often over the study period.
   Finally, the density E. f rufus decreased in the study area while the
   densities of their main food competitors, Varecia variegata and Eulemur
   rubriventer, increased. Although few primate populations are numerically
   stable over time, we suggest that female behavioral responses to
   decreases in fruit availability may have influenced some of the
   demographic changes we witnessed in this study.},

Abstract = {Females of species that live in matrilineal hierarchies may compete for
   temporally limited resources, yet maintain social harmony to facilitate
   cohesion. The relative degree of aggressive and nonaggressive
   interactions may depend on the reproductive condition of sender and
   receiver. Individuals can benefit by clearly signaling and detecting
   reproductive condition. Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) live in social
   matrilineal herds. Females have long estrous cycles (14-16 weeks)
   composed of luteal (8-12 weeks) and follicular (4-8 weeks) phases. In
   this study, we observed the behavior of four captive Asian elephant
   females during multiple estrous cycles over 2 years. We evaluated
   whether investigative, aggressive, and tail flicking behaviors were
   related to reproductive condition. Investigative trunk tip contacts
   showed no distinct pattern by senders, but were more prevalent toward
   female elephants that were in their follicular compared with their
   luteal phase. The genital area was the most frequently contacted region
   and may release reproductively related chemosignals. Aggression did not
   differ significantly with estrus; however, rates of aggression were
   elevated when senders were approaching ovulation and receivers were in
   the luteal phase. Females in the follicular phase may honestly advertise
   their condition. Contacts by conspecifics may serve to assess condition
   and reduce aggression. A behavior termed ``tail flicking{''} was
   performed mainly during the mid-follicular phase when estrogen and
   luteinizing hormone levels are known to spike. Tail flicking may
   disperse chemical signals in urine or mucus as well as act as a tonic
   signal that could provide a means of anticipating forthcoming ovulation
   by elephants and also for human observers and caretakers.},

   embryonic and postnatal gene function in a broad range of species.
   Although some genetic mutations cause obvious morphological change,
   other mutations can be more subtle and, without adequate observation and
   quantification, might be overlooked. For the increasing number of
   genetic model organisms examined by the growing field of phenomics,
   standardized but sensitive methods for quantitative analysis need to be
   incorporated into routine practice to effectively acquire and analyze
   ever-increasing quantities of phenotypic data. In this study, we present
   platform-independent parameters for the use of microscopic x-ray
   computed tomography (microCT) for phenotyping species-specific skeletal
   morphology of a variety of different genetic model organisms. We show
   that microCT is suitable for phenotypic characterization for prenatal
   and postnatal specimens across multiple species.},

Abstract = {The order Proboscidea includes extant elephants and their extinct
   relatives and is closely related to the aquatic sirenians (manatees and
   dugongs) and terrestrial hyracoids (hyraxes). Some analyses of
   embryological, morphological, and paleontological data suggest that
   proboscideans and sirenians shared an aquatic or semiaquatic common
   ancestor, but independent tests of this hypothesis have proven elusive.
   Here we test the hypothesis of an aquatic ancestry for advanced
   proboscideans by measuring 5180 in tooth enamel of two late Eocene
   proboscidean genera, Barytherium and Moeritherium, which are sister taxa
   of Oligocene-to-Recent proboscideans. The combination of low 5180 values
   and low 5180 standard deviations in Barytherium and Moeritherium matches
   the isotopic pattern seen in aquatic and semiaquatic mammals, and
   differs from that of terrestrial mammals. delta C-13 values of these
   early proboscideans suggest that both genera are likely to have consumed
   freshwater plants, although a component of C-3 terrestrial vegetation
   cannot be ruled out. The simplest explanation for the combined evidence
   from isotopes, dental functional morphology, and depositional
   environments is that Barytherium and Moeritherium were at least
   semiaquatic and lived in freshwater swamp or riverine environments,
   where they grazed on freshwater vegetation. These results lend new
   support to the hypothesis that Oligocene-to-Recent proboscideans are
   derived from amphibious ancestors.},

Abstract = {Recent field and revisionary studies of Madagascar's endemic rodents
   (Muroidea: Nesomyidae: Nesomyinae) have dramatically improved our
   understanding of species-level diversity within this group. However,
   such studies have generally focused on taxa from the island's relatively
   well-studied eastern humid forests and have relied solely on
   morphometric comparisons. Herein, we undertake a study of morphometric
   and genetic variation within Macrotarsomys bastardi, a rodent endemic to
   Madagascar's dry forest habitats. In particular, we evaluate existing
   subspecific boundaries using comparisons of cranial and external
   measurements from 84 museum specimens. We then assess phylogeographic
   structure across the geographic range of the species using sequence
   variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene from a subset of these
   specimens. We conclude that there is little basis for recognizing
   established subspecies, but that molecular data reveal novel patterns of
   diversity and geographic structure within this species. These results,
   coupled with emerging patterns of diversity in other endemic Malagasy
   mammals, suggest that there is underestimated diversity and
   biogeographic structure within Madagascar's western habitats.},

Title = {Do meerkats engage in conflict management following aggression?

Volume = {75},

Abstract = {Group-living primates and other animals use postaggression ( PA)
   behavioural strategies to reduce the social costs of aggression.
   However, the relative frequency with which individuals use these
   conflict management strategies is unclear in many species, and
   functional analyses of these behaviours are rare. We observed aggression
   by dominant individuals against group members in cooperatively breeding
   meerkats, Suricata suricatta, and examined the incidents and effects of
   PA affiliation between the opponents ( reconciliation), avoidance and
   submission. Aggression had a negative effect on the social relationship
   between opponents because of an elevated probability of aggression
   occurrence and an increased time interval until the first nonagonistic
   PA encounter compared to nonagonistic ( control) encounters. The
   probability of aggression reoccurrence did not decrease with increasing
   time interval until the first PA encounter, indicating that aggression
   had long-lasting negative effects on social relationships. Evidence of
   reconciliation following aggression was not confirmed in this species.
   Avoidance and submission by the victim characterized the social
   behaviour following aggression. Although avoidance by victims in the
   first PA encounter reduced the probability of aggression reoccurrence,
   submission during aggression neither reduced the probability of
   aggression reoccurrence nor shortened the time interval until the first
   PA encounter. These results suggest that avoidance is the only
   behavioural option for victims of aggression to deal with PA hostility.
   Reconciliation and other forms of conflict management may be more
   important in species with low reproductive skew and with opportunities
   for negotiating relationships between group members than in despotic
   singular cooperative breeders. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {Some non-human primates produce acoustically distinct alarm calls to
   different predators, such as eagles or leopards. Recipients respond to
   these calls as if they have seen the actual predator, which has led to
   the notion of functionally referential alarm calls. However, in a
   previous study with free-ranging putty-nosed monkeys (Cercopithecus
   nictitans martini), we demonstrated that callers produced two
   acoustically distinct alarm calls to eagle shrieks and leopard growls,
   but both alarm calls were given to both predators. We can think of two
   basic explanations for this surprising result, a methodological and
   theoretical one. Firstly, acoustic predator models may not always be
   suitable to test alarm call behaviour in primates, sometimes causing
   uncharacteristic behaviour. Secondly, referential alarm calling may not
   be a universal feature of primate alarm call systems. Considering the
   methodological and theoretical importance of these possibilities, we
   conducted a follow-up study using life-sized leopard, eagle, and human
   models on the same population and compared the resulting vocal responses
   to those given to acoustic predator models. We compared the alarm call
   series given to each of these predator model types and found a
   considerable degree of consistency suggesting that the mode of
   presentation did not affect anti-predator calling strategies. However,
   evidence for audience effects on calling behaviour was inconclusive.
   While it appears that predator class is reliably encoded by different
   call series types irrespective of the mode of presentation, observations
   of these same call series given in non-predatory contexts indicate that
   predator class is unlikely to be the relevant organising principle
   underlying the alarm-calling behaviour in this species. We conclude by
   offering an alternative, non-referential, account of the alarm-calling
   system exhibited by this species.},

Title = {E-government diffusion: a comparison of adoption constructs},
Journal = {TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT- PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {147-161},
Abstract = {Purpose - E-government adoption is the focus of many research studies.
   However, few studies have compared the adoption factors to identify the
   most salient predictors of e-government use. The purpose of this paper
   is to compare popular adoption constructs to identify the most
   influential.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey was administered to elicit
   citizen perceptions of e-government services.
   Findings - The results of stepwise regression indicate perceived
   usefulness, trust of the internet, previous use of an e-government
   service and perceived ease of use all have a significant impact on one's
   intention to use an e-government service. Perceived usefulness emerges
   as the most important factor in predicting e-government adoption. This
   factor alone explains 74.8 percent of the variance in intention to use.
   Research limitations/implications - In light of these findings,
   researchers should still explore the role of adoption factors in
   e-government diffusion. The proposed model is a robust, yet parsimonious
   way to explore the key factors that influence technology acceptance.
   This study includes the adoption perceptions of citizens from one state
   in the USA. Future studies should overcome this limitation by
   incorporating citizens from other regions and nations.
   Practical implications - This study illustrates the elements of
   e-government use that are most salient to citizens. Government agencies
   should focus on these factors when designing and promoting e-services.
   Originality/value - This study shows that the integration of a
   technology acceptance model, trust and previous e-government experience
   work together to explain a large percentage of variance in intention to
   use e-government. In particular, perceived usefulness (aka relative
   advantage, aka performance expectancy) is the most salient predictor.},

Abstract = {Molecular estimates for the divergence of Chrysochloridae (golden moles)
   and Tenrecoidea (tenrecs) date back to near the K-T boundary, but at
   present the oldest undoubted fossil members of these clades are early
   Miocene in age (similar to 20 Ma). The only Paleogene African genus that
   has been proposed as a possible stem tenrecoid is late Eocene (similar
   to 34 Ma) Widanelfarasia from Egypt, heretofore known only from the
   lower dentition. Here we employ high-resolution computed tomography to
   reveal the morphology of the maxillary post-canine dentition of
   Widanelfarasia, and describe fragmentary dental and mandibular remains
   of early Oligocene Jawharia (gen. nov.) and Eochrysochloris (gen. nov.).
   The upper molar dentition of Widanelfarasia provides evidence for an
   intermediate morphological stage between moderate dilambdodonty and
   incipient zalambdodonty. Phylogenetic analysis employing the
   morphological character matrix of Asher and Hofreiter (2006) places
   Widanelfarasia within crown Tenrecoidea, but an alternative placement of
   that genus as a stem tenrecoid could not be statistically rejected.
   Additional support for the latter hypothesis, and for the hypothesis of
   convergent evolution of zalambdodonty within Afrosoricida, is provided
   by Eochrysochloris gen. nov., which shares apomorphic premolar features
   with Miocene Prochrysochloris and extant chrysochlorids, but retains a
   well-developed talonid basin on its lower molars. Jawharia gen. nov. is
   interpreted as an advanced stem tenrecoid that provides additional
   support for the hypothesis that tenrecoid zalambdodonty evolved from
   moderate dilambdodonty. Some of the apomorphic morphological features
   shared by Widanelfarasia and early Miocene Protenrec are also seen in
   Todralestes, from the oldest (late Paleocene) placental mammal-bearing
   locality in Africa. As such Todralestes may be a stem or crown
   afrosoricid, and, if so, the oldest known Afro-Arabian member of
   Afrotheria.},

Abstract = {Tenrecs (Tenrecidae) are a widely diversified assemblage of small
   eutherian mammals that occur in Madagascar and Western and Central
   Africa. With the exception of a few early karyotypic descriptions based
   on conventional staining, nothing is known about the chromosomal
   evolution of this family. We present a detailed analysis of G-banded and
   molecularly defined chromosomes based on fluorescence in situ
   hybridization (FISH) that allows a comprehensive comparison between the
   karyotypes of 11 species of two closely related Malagasy genera,
   Microgale (10 species) and Oryzorictes (one species), of the subfamily
   Oryzorictinae. The karyotypes of Microgale taiva and M. parvula (2n =
   32) were found to be identical to that of O. hova (2n = 32) most likely
   reflecting the ancestral karyotypes of both genera, as well as that of
   the Oryzorictinae. Parsimony analysis of chromosomal rearrangements that
   could have arisen following Whole Arm Reciprocal Translocations (WARTs)
   showed, however, that these are more likely to be the result of
   Robertsonian translocations. A single most parsimonious tree was
   obtained that provides strong support for three species associations
   within Microgale, all of which are consistent with previous molecular
   and morphological investigations. By expanding on a recently published
   molecular clock for the Tenrecidae we were able to place our findings in
   a temporal framework that shows strong chromosomal rate heterogeneity
   within the Oryzorictinae. We use these data to critically examine the
   possible role of chromosomal rearrangements in speciation within
   Microgale.},

Abstract = {Behavioral monogamy in mammals varies from male-female pairs that spend
   most of their time in close spatial contact (associated pair-living) to
   pairs that occupy exclusive territories but travel, forage, and sleep
   alone (dispersed pair-living). We present radiotelemetry data on 46
   adult large treeshrews (Tupaia tana) from 2 populations in Sabah,
   Malaysia, that indicate that this species forms dispersed pairs across a
   range of ecological conditions. Dispersed pair-living was the primary
   behavioral mating system in primary forest during a major fruit masting
   event, in nonmasting primary forest, and in selectively logged forest
   with significantly higher fruitfall than in primary forest. Territories
   of behavioral partners were spatially concordant, but both male and
   female territories typically overlapped the boundaries of 1-3 extra-pair
   territories. Comparison between masting and nonmasting forests indicated
   that females exhibited better body condition during masting, whereas
   males exhibited larger home-range areas and longer daily movements. Both
   males and females exhibited better body condition in selectively logged
   versus primary forests, but ranging patterns were not significantly
   different between these habitats. We argue that intraspecific foraging
   competition is the most likely explanation for the evolution of
   dispersed pair-living in T. tana.},

Abstract = {The need to develop conservation plans calls for the ability to identify
   ecological factors that influence population density. Because stress is
   known to affect fecundity and mortality, increasing stress may provide a
   warning of potential population declines. We examined the effects of
   temporal variation in nutrition and parasitism on stress in endangered
   red colobus monkeys in Kibale National Park, Uganda. First, we tested
   the hypothesis that parasitism and nutrition would individually affect
   stress levels. We found that periods of poor-quality diet corresponded.
   with an increase in cortisol. Similarly, increases in parasite
   infections were associated with increased cortisol. Next, we predicted
   that a poor-quality diet would facilitate increased parasite infections,
   and that together, they would lead to amplified stress. However, we
   found no support for such amplification, likely because the quality of
   the diet had little effect on parasite infections. Third, we tested
   whether individuals in a larger group were subject to food stress due to
   greater within-group competition, which would intensify nutritional
   stress and parasitism, and lead to reduced reproduction. Although we
   found no evidence to support a group size effect on parasites, cortisol
   levels in the large group tended to be higher than those in the small
   group, and the large group had fewer infants per female. The results
   suggest that parasitism and poor nutrition lead to increased stress
   which, because they are known to be associated with reduced fecundity
   and increased mortality, may lead to population declines.},

Title = {Platyrrhine dental eruption sequences},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {134},
Number = {2},
Pages = {226-239},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To determine dental eruption sequences of extant platyrrhines, 367
   mandibles and maxillae of informative juvenile specimens from all 16
   genera were scored for presence of permanent teeth including three
   intermediate eruption stages following Harvati (Am J Phys Anthropol 112
   (2000) 69-85). The timing of molar eruption relative to that of the
   anterior dentition is variable in platyrrhines. Aotus is precocious,
   with all molars erupting in succession before replacement of any
   deciduous teeth, while Cebus is delayed in M2-3 eruption relative to
   I1-2. Callitrichines have a distinct tendency toward delayed canine and
   premolar development. Platyrrhine eruption sequences presented here show
   some evidence of conformity to Schultz's Rule, with relatively early
   replacement of deciduous dentition in ``slower{''}-growing animals. The
   relationship of dental eruption sequences to degree of folivory, body
   mass, brain mass, of molars relative to anterior teeth in Pithecia,
   Chiropotes, and Cacajao, in comparison to genera such as Ateles,
   Lagothrix, and Alouatta, showing relatively later eruption of the
   molars, appears to be consistent with current phylogenetic hypotheses.
   Schultz (Am J Phys Anthropol 19 (1935) 489-581) postulated early
   relative molar eruption as the primitive dental eruption schedule for
   primates. The extremely early molar eruption of Aotus versus Callicebus
   (where both incisors erupt before M2 and M3, with M3 usually last) may
   lend support to the status of Aotus as a basal taxon. The early relative
   molar eruption of the fossil platyrrhine species Branisella boliviana is
   also consistent with this hypothesis (Takai et al.: Am J Phys Anthropol
   111 (2000) 263-281).},

Title = {Changes in fecal progestagen profile after excretion in miniature pigs},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the fecal progestagen
   (progesterone and its metabolites) levels of miniature pigs would change
   after excretion at room temperature. Our initial investigation focused
   on the correlations between the fecal progestagen concentrations with
   and without ether extraction and between the plasma progesterone and
   fecal progestagen concentrations in order to develop an enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for fecal progestagen without ether
   extraction. There were significant correlations between fecal
   progestagen concentrations with and without ether extraction (r=0.880)
   and between fecal progestagen concentrations without ether extraction
   and plasma progesterone (r=0.763). The fecal progestagen concentration
   obtained by ELISA without ether extraction was almost identical to that
   obtained with ether extraction. These results validate the ELISA method
   without ether extraction, which was therefore used for the latter
   experiment. Fecal samples collected from the pigs were preserved for
   0-24 h at room temperature, and then their fecal progestagen
   concentrations were measured. The fecal samples preserved for 0 to 24 h
   were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and
   ELISA. The concentrations of all samples significantly increased with
   time after preservation. The progestagen concentration of fresh feces (0
   h) with high progestagen concentration (>1000 ng/g) increased
   significantly after 3 h. The concentration increased significantly after
   12 h for fresh feces containing about 500 ng/g progestagen. HPLC
   analysis is showed that the fecal progesterone concentration, but not
   its other metabolites, doubled 24 h after excretion compared with the
   concentration at 0 h. These results suggest that dynamic changes in the
   profile of progesterone metabolites occur in feces after excretion.},

Title = {Female feeding priority in bonobos, Pan paniscus, and the question of
   female dominance},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {69},
Number = {8},
Pages = {837-850},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The question of whether bonobos show feeding priority and female
   dominance has been proposed and examined, both in the wild and in
   captive studies, with differing results. The relationship between female
   dominance and female feeding priority has been best studied in prosimian
   primates. These studies use established criteria of females consistently
   evoking submissive behavior from males in dyadic encounters for
   determining female dominance. Although the relationship is complex,
   female dominance in prosimians is associated with preferential access to
   food. Data from studies of wild habituated bonobos in the Lomako Forest,
   Democratic Republic of the Congo, are examined for evidence of both
   female feeding priority and female social dominance using similar
   criteria as used for prosimians. Bonobos showed evidence of female
   feeding priority in small, but not in large, food patches. Male-male
   competition for mating opportunities at the start of the food bout was
   related to some, but not all, differences in time spent feeding between
   the sexes. Female dominance similar to that seen in prosimians was not
   observed in these bonobos. Males were consistently dominant in dyadic
   interactions. Female feeding priority with male dyadic social dominance
   implies that male deference during feeding cannot be excluded as one
   explanation of interpretations of female dominance in bonobos.
   Additionally, dominance of male bonobos by females appears to require
   the presence of female coalition partners. As in other primates with
   female feeding priority, bonobo females express this trait where food is
   economically defendable. Unlike prosimians, however, bonobo female
   feeding priority may result from male deference and the importance of
   female coalitions in nondyadic interactions.},

Abstract = {The mammalian masticatory apparatus is distinguished from the intra-oral
   processing systems of other amniotes by a number of morphological and
   functional features, including transverse movements of the teeth during
   the power stroke, precise occlusion, suspension of the teeth in the
   socket by a periodontal ligament, diphyodonty (reduction to two
   generations of teeth), a hard palate, and the presence of a single bone
   (the dentary) in the lower jaw which articulates with the skull at the
   temporomandibular jaw joint. The evolution of these features is commonly
   argued to have improved the efficiency of food processing in the oral
   cavity. The present aricle highlights the existence in mammals of the
   fusimotor system and afferent fibers from the periodontal ligament
   through which the CNS modulates the responses by the muscle spindles.
   Published data suggest that the fusimotor system and the periodontal
   afferents are important components in feed-forward (or anticipatory)
   control of chewing behavior. We hypothesize that this feed-forward
   control is used to maintain relatively constant cycle lengths in mammals
   in the face of intra-sequence and inter-sequence variation in material
   properties of the food, and that this enables them to maintain a higher
   average chewing frequency than that of lizards. These predictions were
   evaluated using data on mean cycle length and its variance from the
   literature and from our own files. On average, mammals have less
   variable cycle lengths than do lizards and shorter cycle lengths than do
   lizards of similar size. We hypothesize that by decreasing variance in
   cycle length, presumably close to the natural frequency of their feeding
   systems, mammals minimize energy expenditure during chewing, allowing
   them to chew for longer, thereby maintaining the high rates of food
   intake required for their high metabolic rates.},

Title = {Physiological ecology of cheirogaleid primates: variation in hibernation
   and torpor},
Journal = {ACTA ETHOLOGICA},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-21},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Torpor (i.e. the reduction of body temperature and metabolic rate for
   less than 24 h) and hibernation (i.e. torpor phases longer than 24 h)
   are among the most extreme adaptations to seasonality in primate
   habitats. Although widespread among mammals, this form of extreme
   thermoregulation is rare among primates and is reported only for species
   of the cheirogaleid family. Understanding their physiological ecology is
   crucial for many aspects of cheirogaleid socioecology like their social
   organization and their mating systems. This paper first provides an
   overview of published information on hibernation and torpor and
   identifies a patchy distribution for the occurrence of hibernation
   across genera, species and populations. Based on a review of published
   studies from the wild and from captivity, we then propose a possible
   explanation for variation in hibernation behavior among Microcebus
   species and populations. Accordingly, the amount of energy that can be
   saved during torpor early in the lean dry season, which is determined by
   the minimum ambient temperature will be decisive. Only where
   temperatures are low, early dry season torpor bouts will be long enough
   to save enough energy to build up fat reserves for longer bouts of
   hibernation. Finally, we summarize information on the causal factors for
   the occurrence of hibernation by analyzing sex differences within
   populations. Further physiological studies on other cheirogaleid species
   are needed to identify the phylogenetic origin of hibernation in
   primates.},

Abstract = {Amblyomma americanum is an aggressive ixodid tick that has been
   implicated as a vector for several bacterial agents. Among these is
   Ehrlichia chaffeensis, which causes human monocytic (or monocytotropic)
   ehrlichiosis. In this study, experimental tick transmission of E.
   chaffeensis from infected lone star ticks to deer was revisited, and the
   question of whether it would be possible to re-isolate the organism from
   deer was asked, because this had not been done previously. Here, we were
   able to transmit a wild strain of E. chaffeensis from acquisition-fed
   lone star ticks to white-tailed deer. Ehrlichia chaffeensis was
   re-isolated from one white-tailed deer on multiple days during the
   infection and from another deer on one day during the infection. Peak
   rickettsemias for E. chaffeensis-infected deer were 17 DPI with
   acquisition-fed ticks and 14 DPI with needle-inoculated deer. This study
   supports the role of the lone star tick and white-tailed deer as vector
   and reservoir host for E. chaffeensis, demonstrating culture
   re-isolation of E. chaffeensis in deer infected by experimental tick
   transmission for the first time.},

Abstract = {Gibbons of both sexes have been observed emigrating from their natal
   groups, but the consequences of dispersal in gibbons are poorly
   understood, and it is unclear whether these Eire the same for both
   sexes. I sequenced a 350-bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA from 18 adults
   in seven siamang (Symphalangus syndactylus) groups at the Way Canguk
   Research Station in southern Sumatra to assess patterns of matrilineal
   relatedness among and within siamang groups, and to assess their fit
   with different patterns of sex-specific dispersal. A total of 11
   haplotypes were identified in the seven study groups; 50\% of adult
   males in five contiguous groups shared a haplotype with a member of an
   immediately adjacent group, whereas only 16.7\% of females shared a
   haplotype with a neighbor. The apparent difference persisted if only
   same-sex individuals were considered (37.5\% of males vs. 0\% of
   females). Four of the seven study groups contained two adult males and a
   single adult female. In three multimale groups, the three adults all had
   different haplotypes, suggesting that neither male was the retained
   adult offspring of the female, whereas in the fourth group, the
   haplotype of one male was identical with that of the adult female. The
   high diversity of haplotypes and the absence of clustering among female
   haplotypes in the study neighborhood suggest that female dispersal to
   territories adjacent to the natal group may be relatively rare. The
   presence of some clustering of male haplotypes suggests that shorter
   dispersal distances may be more common in males.},

Title = {A remarkable female cranium of the early Oligocene anthropoid
   Aegyptopithecus zeuxis (Catarrhini, Propliopithecidae)},

Abstract = {The most complete and best-preserved cranium of a Paleogene anthropoid
   ever found, that of a small female of the early Oligocene (approximate
   to 29-30 Ma) stem catarrhine species Aegyptopithecus zeuxis, was
   recovered from the Jebel Qatrani Formation (Fayurn Depression, Egypt) in
   2004. The specimen is that of a subadult and, in craniodental
   dimensions, is the smallest Aegyptopithecus individual known.
   High-resolution computed tomographic (microCT) scanning of the
   specimen's well preserved cranial vault confirms that Aegyptopithecus
   had relatively unexpanded frontal lobes and a brain-to-body mass ratio
   lower than those of living anthropoids. MicroCT scans of a male cranium
   recovered in 1966 {[}Egyptian Geological Museum, Cairo (CGM) 40237]
   reveal that previous estimates of its endocranial volume were too large.
   Thus, some amount of encephalization evolved independently in
   platyrrhine and catarrhine anthropoids, and the relative brain size of
   the last common ancestor of crown Anthropoidea was probably
   strepsir-rhine-like or smaller. A. zeuxis shows extreme sexual
   dimorphism in craniodental morphology (apparently to a degree otherwise
   seen only in some highly dimorphic Miocene catarrhines), and the crania
   of female Aegyptopithecus lack a number of morphological features seen
   in larger males that have been accorded phylogenetic significance in
   catarrhine systematics (e.g., a well developed rostrum, elongate
   sagittal crest, and frontal trigon). Although a unique pattern of
   craniofacial sexual dimorphism may have characterized advanced stem and
   basal crown catarrhines, expression of various allegedly ``discrete{''}
   craniofacial features may have been intraspecifically variable in early
   catarrhine species due to high levels of dimorphism and so should be
   treated with caution in phylogenetic analyses.},

Abstract = {Sex-biased dispersal is an almost ubiquitous feature of mammalian life
   history, but the evolutionary causes behind these patterns still require
   much clarification. A quarter of a century since the publication of
   seminal papers describing general patterns of sex-biased dispersal in
   both mammals and birds, we review the advances in our theoretical
   understanding of the evolutionary causes of sex-biased dispersal, and
   those in statistical genetics that enable us to test hypotheses and
   measure dispersal in natural populations. We use mammalian examples to
   illustrate patterns and proximate causes of sex-biased dispersal,
   because by far the most data are available and because they exhibit an
   enormous diversity in terms of dispersal strategy, mating and social
   systems. Recent studies using molecular markers have helped to confirm
   that sex-biased dispersal is widespread among mammals and varies widely
   in direction and intensity, but there is a great need to bridge the gap
   between genetic information, observational data and theory. A review of
   mammalian data indicates that the relationship between direction of
   sex-bias and mating system is not a simple one. The role of social
   systems emerges as a key factor in determining intensity and direction
   of dispersal bias, but there is still need for a theoretical framework
   that can account for the complex interactions between inbreeding
   avoidance, kin competition and cooperation to explain the impressive
   diversity of patterns.},

Abstract = {Dispersal and philopatry influence gene flow and thus the spatio-genetic
   structure within and between populations. In callitrichids the flexible
   social and mating system corresponds with a variable migration pattern
   where both sexes might be philopatric or might disperse. We investigated
   the relationship between the spatiogenetic structure and migration
   patterns in a population of mustached tamarins, Saguinus mystax. Using
   the rapidly evolving hypervariable region I (HVI) of the mitochondrial
   control region and 11 microsatellite markers we detected a high
   variation (HVI: 16 haplotypes in 69 individuals; micro-satellites: H-O =
   0.75, average: 7.45 alleles/locus), with mating partners usually not
   sharing the same haplotype, indicating that matings are generally
   between partners that are not closely related. Similar high variance of
   haplotype differences for male-male and female-female pairs, along with
   a slightly higher number of haplotype differences in males show that
   both sexes habitually migrate. Spatial analyses suggest that females
   usually migrate longer distances, corresponding to very limited breeding
   positions for females in a polyandrous social mating system.},

Title = {Fiber type distribution in the shoulder muscles of the tree shrew, the
   cotton-top tamarin, and the squirrel monkey related to shoulder
   movements and forelimb loading},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {52},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Muscle fiber type composition of intrinsic shoulder muscles was examined
   in tree shrews, cotton-top tamarins, and squirrel monkeys with respect
   to their shoulder kinematics and forelimb loading during locomotion.
   Enzyme- and immunohistochemical techniques were applied to differentiate
   muscle fiber types on serial cross-sections of the shoulder. In the
   majority of the shoulder muscles, the proportions of fatigue resistant
   slow-twitch fibers (SO) and fatigable fast-twitch fibers (FG) were
   inversely related to each other, whereas the percentage of intermediate
   FOG-fibers varied independently. A segregation of fatigue resistant
   SO-fibers into deep muscle regions is indicative of differential
   activation of histochernically distinct muscle regions in which deep
   regions stabilize the joint against gravitational loading. In all three
   species, this antigravity function was demonstrated for both the
   supraspinatus and the cranial subscapularis muscle, which prevent
   passive joint flexion during the support phase of the limb. The
   infraspinatus muscle showed a high content of SO-fibers in the primate
   species but not in the tree shrew, which demonstrates the `' new `' role
   of the infraspinatus muscle in joint stabilization related to the higher
   degree of humeral protraction in primates. In the tree shrew and the
   cotton-top tamarin, a greater proportion of the body weight is carried
   on the forelimb, but the squirrel monkey exhibits a weight shift to the
   hind limbs. The lower amount of forelimb loading is reflected by an
   overall lower proportion of fatigue resistant muscle fibers in the
   shoulder muscles of the squirrel monkey. Several muscles such as the
   deltoid no longer function as joint stabilizers and allow the humerus to
   move beyond the scapular plane. These differences among species
   demonstrate the high plasticity of the internal muscle architecture and
   physiology which is suggested to be the underlying reason for different
   muscle activity patterns in homologous muscles. Implications for the
   evolution of new locomotor modes in primates are discussed. (c) 2006

Abstract = {We investigated patterns of jaw-muscle coordination during rhythmic
   mastication in three species of ungulates displaying the marked
   transverse jaw movements typical of many large mammalian herbivores. In
   order to quantify consistent motor patterns during chewing,
   electromyograms were recorded from the superficial masseter, deep
   masseter, posterior temporalis and medial pterygoid muscles of goats,
   alpacas and horses. Timing differences between muscle pairs were
   evaluated in the context of an evolutionary model of jaw-muscle
   function. In this model, the closing and food reduction phases of
   mastication are primarily controlled by two distinct muscle groups,
   triplet I (balancing-side superficial masseter and medial pterygoid and
   working-side posterior temporalis) and triplet II (working-side
   superficial masseter and medial pterygoid and balancing-side posterior
   temporalis), and the asynchronous activity of the working- and
   balancing-side deep masseters. The three species differ in the extent to
   which the jaw muscles are coordinated as triplet I and triplet II.
   Alpacas, And to a lesser extent, goats, exhibit the triplet pattern
   whereas horses do not. In contrast, all three species show marked
   asynchrony of the working-side and balancing-side deep masseters, with
   jaw closing initiated by the working-side muscle and the balancing-side
   muscle firing much later during closing. However, goats differ from
   alpacas and horses in the timing of the balancing-side deep masseter
   relative to the triplet II muscles. This study highlights interspecific
   differences in the coordination of jaw muscles to influence transverse
   jaw movements and the production of bite force in herbivorous ungulates.},

Abstract = {Modulation of force during mammalian mastication provides insight into
   force modulation in rhythmic, cyclic behaviors. This study uses in vivo
   bone strain data from the mandibular corpus to test two hypotheses
   regarding bite force modulation during rhythmic mastication in mammals:
   (1) that bite force is modulated by varying the duration of force
   production, or (2) that bite force is modulated by varying the rate at
   which force is produced. The data sample consists of rosette strain data
   from 40 experiments on 11 species of mammals, including six primate
   genera and four nonprimate species: goats, pigs, horses and alpacas.
   Bivariate correlation and multiple regression methods are used to assess
   relationships between maximum (epsilon(1)) and minimum (epsilon(2))
   principal strain magnitudes and the following variables: loading time
   and mean loading rate from 5\% of peak to peak strain, unloading time
   and mean unloading rate from peak to 5\% of peak strain, chew cycle
   duration, and chew duty factor. Bivariate correlations reveal that in
   the majority of experiments strain magnitudes are significantly (P <
   0.001) correlated with strain loading and unloading rates and not with
   strain loading and unloading times. In those cases when strain
   magnitudes are also correlated with loading times, strain magnitudes are
   more highly correlated with loading rate than loading time. Multiple
   regression analyses reveal that variation in strain magnitude is best
   explained by variation in loading rate. Loading time and related
   temporal variables (such as overall chew cycle time and chew duty
   factor) do not explain significant amounts of additional variance. Few
   and only weak correlations were found between strain magnitude and chew
   cycle time and chew duty factor. These data suggest that bite force
   modulation during rhythmic mastication in mammals is mainly achieved by
   modulating the rate at which force is generated within a chew cycle, and
   less so by varying temporal parameters. Rate modulation rather than time
   modulation may allow rhythmic mastication to proceed at a relatively
   constant frequency, simplifying motor control computation.},

Abstract = {We determined if data on strepsirhine body and home range sizes support
   an optimal body size (OBS) model of 100 g, as predicted from studies of
   energetics in terrestrial mammals. We also tested the following
   predictions of the OBS model: 1) relationships between body and home
   range sizes will change slope and sign above and below the OBS threshold
   of 100 g and 2) best-fit lines for OBS regression models (above and
   below the 100-g threshold) will intersect at ca. 100 9 (range of 80-250
   g). We collected data on body mass, home range size, and vertical
   ranging behavior for 37 strepsirhines from the literature. Linear
   regression analyses and phylogenetic independent contrasts methods
   revealed that body size is a significant determinant of both
   2-dimensional (ha) and 3-dimensional (km 3) home range sizes only in
   ta-va weighing >100 g. There were consistent changes in the sign of the
   slopes above and below the OBS threshold. The intersections of the
   best-fit lines were within the OBS range for the body size to
   3-dimensional home range comparisons. Thus, the data provide some
   support for the OBS model in strepsirhines. However, no regression model
   was statistically significant for the ta-va below the OBS threshold,
   which may reflect small sample sizes. Also, no slope differed
   significantly between taxa above and below the OBS. Significant
   correlations between body and home range sizes for the complete data
   sets refute the I-shaped constraint space predicted via the OBS model.},

Title = {Bimorphism in male Verreaux's sifaka in the Kirindy Forest of Madagascar},

Year = {2007},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Male primates in species with pronounced secondary sexual adornments can
   exhibit reversible or irreversible bimorphism, i.e., striking variation
   in the degree to which males express the adornments. Verreaux's sifaka
   (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) use scent marking as a form of
   communication and exhibit sex differences in scent glands. Some males
   exhibit a pronounced brown staining around their sternal gland, whereas
   others do not. We studied morphological and behavioral characteristics
   of males in 6 social groups in Kirindy Forest, Madagascar, from November
   2000 to March 2002 to evaluate the hypotheses that the bimorphism in
   male sifaka chest status represents alternative mating tactics and is a
   badge of status. Males are clearly divided into 2 categories: clean and
   stained chests, with rare, but informative, intermediate males. The
   chest staining probably results from the males scent marking with their
   sternal glands, because stained-chested males scent marked significantly
   more often than clean-chested males. Though sample sizes are small,
   chest status did not appear to depend on body size. Chest status is
   reversible and related to dominance rank. In each group, only I male,
   the dominant, was stained-chested, whereas all other (subordinate) males
   were clean-chested. These findings suggest that stained chests are
   visual and olfactory signals of dominance rank and that clean chests
   signal lack of competitive intent. Thus, this bimorphism may reflect
   alternative mating tactics used by males to maximize their reproductive
   success based upon their social environment.},

Abstract = {Regular endurance exercise has favorable effects on cardiovascular risk
   factors. However, the impact of an exercise-induced change in aerobic
   fitness on blood lipids is often inconsistent. The purpose of this study
   was to investigate the effect of nine consecutive months of training on
   aerobic fitness and blood lipids in untrained adults. Thirty subjects
   35-55 years of age (wt: 73.1 +/- 13.6 kg, height 171.1 +/- 9.0 cm,
   \%body fat 24.6 +/- 6.3\%, 14 males and 16 females) were randomly
   assigned to an exercise (EG) (N = 20) and control (CG) (N = 10) group.
   All subjects completed an incremental treadmill test, anthropometric
   measurements, and venous blood sample collection before and after the 9
   months of exercise. Participants in the exercise group were supervised
   and adjusted for improvements in running performance, whereas no change
   was administered for the control group. One-way and multivariate ANOVA
   was conducted to determine significant differences in means for time and
   group in selected variables {[}body mass, \% body fat, BMI; VO2peak,
   km/h at 2.0 (v-LA2) and 4.0 (v-LA4) mmol l(-1) blood lactate (LA)
   concentration, km/h of the last load (v-max); TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, Apo
   B, Apo A-1, and Lp (a)]. Correlation coefficients and multivariate
   regression analysis was used to determine the association between
   aerobic fitness and blood lipids. The exercise group improved
   significantly (P < 0.0001) in VO2peak, v-LA2, v-LA4, v-max and exhibited
   a significant decrease in Apo B (P < 0.04) compared to the control group
   (NS). In 9 months, E achieved 24\% increase in VO2peak and 18\%
   reduction in Apo B, denoting the impact of cardiovascular fitness on
   cardiovascular risk.},

Abstract = {An innovative system of digital transmission for long range applications
   in the HF band (3-30 MHz) is presented. The technical challenge is to
   increase significantly the data transfer rate when compared with
   standard modems (typically 4.8 kbits/s in a 3 kHz bandwidth). For this
   purpose, an original array of collocated receiving antennas is developed
   as support for the implementation of a blind spatio temporal
   equalization. Consequently, the effective bandwidth is extended up to 12
   kHz. An experimental 780 km range radio link is tested with a data
   transfer rate attaining 40kbits/s and a BER (bit error rate) remaining
   moderate. Still images are transmitted with a specific source-channel
   coding and the good quality of service is confirmed by the fidelity of
   the restored images. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Although it is difficult for observers to determine how non-human

   In this study, the sniffing behaviors of wild chimpanzees were divided
   into six categories, and sex differences were found in most categories.
   Males sniffed more frequently than females in sexual and social
   situations, while females sniffed more often during feeding and
   self-checking. Chimpanzees sniffed more frequently during the dry season
   than during the wet season, presumably due to the low humidity. This
   suggests that the environment affects olfactory use by chimpanzees and
   that chimpanzees easily gather new information from the ground via
   sniffing.},

Title = {Late Pleistocene bat fossils from Anjohibe Cave, northwestern Madagascar},
Journal = {ACTA CHIROPTEROLOGICA},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-65},
Abstract = {In spite of decades of research on Madagascar's unique and endemic modem
   fauna, the evolutionary history of the island's bat fauna remains
   largely unknown. Their origin and evolution is largely unknown because
   of the nature of the fossil record; the deepest well-dated glimpse of
   Madagascar's mammal groups comes from only 26,000 years ago. Bat remains
   have frequently been recovered from paleontological sites, but have been
   rarely identified or described. It therefore remains unknown whether
   bats underwent a reduction in species diversity similar to that seen in
   many of Madagascar's vertebrate clades. Herein I describe a collection
   of newly discovered subfossil bats from Anjohibe Cave, northwestern
   Madagascar, some estimated to have been deposited about 80,000 years
   ago. Five bat genera are represented as subfossil (Rousettus, Eidolon,
   Hipposideros, Triaenops, and Myotis) with four of these genera present
   in Anjohibe Cave today. The subfossil material has yielded two new
   species, indicating that Malagasy bats experienced recent species
   turnover, paralleling what is seen in much of the island's terrestrial
   vertebrate fauna.},

   important implications for interpreting an early lorisiform fossil
   record that is still composed primarily of jaws and isolated teeth.},

Abstract = {The 20S proteasome is a catalytic core of the 26S proteasome, a central
   enzyme in the degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. It is
   composed of 14 distinct gene products that form four stacked rings of
   seven subunits each, alpha(1-7)beta(1-7)beta(1-7)alpha(1-7). It is
   reported that the biogenesis of mammalian 20S proteasomes is assisted by
   proteasome-specific chaperones, named PAC1, PAC2, and hUmp1, but the
   details are still unknown. Here, we report the identification of a
   chaperone, designated PAC3, as a component of alpha rings. Although it
   can intrinsically bind directly to both alpha and beta subunits, PAC3
   dissociates before the formation of half-proteasomes, a process coupled
   with the recruitment of beta subunits and hUmp1. Knockdown of PAC3
   impaired alpha ring formation. Further, PAC1/2/3 triple knockdown
   resulted in the accumulation of disorganized half-proteasomes that are
   incompetent for dimerization. Our results describe a cooperative system
   of multiple chaperones involved in the correct assembly of mammalian 20S
   proteasomes.},

Volume = {68},
Number = {12},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Despite the persistent use of the word ``solitary{''} to describe
   nocturnal primate social behavior, increasing numbers of studies are
   revealing sophisticated levels of social interactions among nocturnal
   primates. This study explores the relationships among 11 adult Mysore
   slender lorises (Loris lydekkerianus lydekkerianus) studied over 10(1/2)
   months in Tamil Nadu, India. When all observations regarding dependent
   offspring are excluded, the animals spent on average 38\% of their
   activity in various forms of neutral, affiliative, and agonistic
   behaviors. Affiliative behaviors were the most common type of social
   interaction, and males in general were more social than females. Low
   values for Cole's index (CI) of association emphasize that females
   rarely interacted with same-sex conspecifics, but commonly interacted
   with males. In turn, males also formed strong affiliative relationships
   with other adult males. This index also indicates that levels of
   affiliation are strongest among animals that share sleeping sites. The
   Hinde index (HI) suggests that males control proximity to females more
   than the reverse. A female's tolerance of multiple males in her home
   range and at a sleeping site may be related to high spatial variability
   of food resources. Such resources may constrain females with costly
   reproductive strategies (up to two sets of twins per annum) to a small
   home range. With their larger home ranges, males may be able to
   monopolize females by initiating social interactions, and also provide a
   benefit to females by contributing to parental care.},

Abstract = {Background A table summarizing the primary literature on 19 species of
   longevous non-human primates, other than owl monkey, is presented.
   Methods We prospectively quantitated the sleep of a longevous female owl
   monkey (Aotus azarae), aged > 30 years, longitudinally for 2 years and
   also evaluated the senility-induced change in spinal curvature.
   Results The mean daily total sleep time (TST) of this monkey ranged
   between 790 and 1106 minutes, and was markedly higher in comparison with
   its female progeny (aged 16 years and used as a control) whose daily TST
   during the same experimental period ranged between 612 and 822 minutes.
   Conclusion The calculated kyphotic index (KI) of 2.27 for this monkey,
   compared with the KIs 4.83 and 5.42, for its progeny and female
   grandprogeny (aged 1 year) respectively, confirmed the prominent spinal

Volume = {98},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to measure changes in plasma adiponectin
   (ApN) over 24 months of exercise intervention in middle age adults with
   a predisposition to metabolic syndrome and to determine if changes in
   ApN were more affected by physical activity or physical fitness.
   Thirty-six subjects completed a 24 months home-based exercise program
   (cycling >= three times per week, >= 45 min/session at 50-65\% of
   VO2peak). Body composition, blood samples, and physical fitness were
   studied at baseline and after 12 and 24 months of participation in the
   study. The prescribed physical activity was monitored via self-reported
   exercise diary to determine MET levels, hours, and exercise compliance.
   Two-tailed repeated measures ANOVA and Spearman Rank Correlation
   Coefficients were used to detect significant differences and
   associations between the variables. ApN increased significantly (P <
   0.05) after 12 months in males (n = 17; 5.3 +/- 1.9-7.0 +/- 3.0 mu g
   ml(-1)) but not in females (n = 9; 8.6 +/- 3.8-11.5 +/- 4.0 mu g
   ml(-1)). The net change in ApN over 24 months was significantly
   correlated to the net change in VO2peak (physical fitness) (r = 0.66; P
   < 0.001), whereas exercise intensity was negatively correlated to ApN
   over 12 months (r = -0.4; P = 0.04) and 24 months (r = -0.45; P = 0.02).
   Based on our results, an improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness of
   15\% increased plasma ApN concentration. Our findings suggest that
   moderate physical activity performed over many months induces positive
   changes in the plasma ApN concentration in adults with a predisposition
   to metabolic syndrome.},

Abstract = {Researchers have conducted most studies on primate conflict management
   and resolution in captive settings. The few studies on groups of the
   same species in captivity and in the wild and the overall comparison
   across species of findings from studies in both settings have reported
   patterns of variation in the rates of various postconflict affinitive
   behaviors that may be setting related. In fact, some authors have
   claimed that the high rates of postconflict affiliation reported in
   captive studies could represent an artifact of captivity. I explored the
   claim and conclude that it is unjustified. I argue that the dichotomy
   captivity vs. wild is conceptually meaningless and scientists should
   abandon it as an explanatory variable, that differences across studies
   both in setting-related variables and in the methods used for assessing
   postconflict affiliation reduce the strength of comparisons within and
   across settings, that the empirical evidence thus far available neither
   allows adequate assessment nor supports any claim that links the rate of
   postconflict affiliation to captivity or wild conditions, and that
   studies conducted in both settings may be equally useful-and should be
   used-to test theoretically relevant hypotheses regarding the causes and
   predictors of variation in postconflict affiliation. Instead of asking
   the title question, I would ask which variables influence postconflict
   affiliation and then whether the variables are really associated only
   with one of the two settings.},

Abstract = {Posture and locomotion are two of the most primitive and basic motor
   manifestations of an organism's behavior. Although the restrictions they
   impose on other motor functions are evident, few studies have considered
   the possibility of asymmetries in these behaviors in human and nonhuman
   primates, and how they might impact other asymmetries at higher
   functional levels. The aim of the current study was to explore in a
   group of 10 chimpanzees at the Madrid Zoo-Aquarium the degree of
   asymmetry in four behaviors related to locomotion (walking, ascending,
   descending, and brachiating) and four behaviors associated with posture
   (sitting, lying, hanging, and changing postures). Few subjects showed
   individual preferences, but significant trends in the group for some of
   the behaviors were found, including right-hand use when initiating
   quadruped walking, and left-hand use when descending and hanging. Some
   significant correlations also emerged: a negative one between walking
   and descending, and a positive one between walking and brachiating and
   between sitting and changing postures. No correlations were found
   between locomotor and postural modes. Although we cannot make
   generalizations on the population level at this time, these findings
   highlight the importance of considering postural and locomotion factors
   when studying motor asymmetries in primates.},

Journal = {DEVELOPMENTAL CELL},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {To dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying convergent extension
   (CE), a prominent set of cell movements during Xenopus gastrulation, we
   performed a functional expression screen and identified a
   GTPase-activating protein for ADP ribosylation factors (ArfGAP), which
   we termed XGAP. We demonstrated that XGAP is required to confine or
   restrict the cellular protrusive activity to the mediolateral ends of
   cells, where XGAP is normally localized, and therefore for the proper
   intercalation of cells participating in CE. We also demonstrated that a
   C-terminal conserved domain of XGAP, but not its GAP activity, is
   required and sufficient for this intracellular localization and
   function. We further showed that XGAP physically interacts with the
   known polarity proteins 14-3-3 epsilon, aPKC, and PAR-6 and directs them

Abstract = {Analyses of dental variation in geographically restricted, wild
   populations of primates are extremely rare; however, such data form the
   best source for models of likely degrees of variation within and between
   fossil species. Data from dental casts of a geographically restricted
   population of moustached tamarins (Saguinus mystax mystax) from Padre
   Isla, Peru, document high levels of dental variability, as measured by
   coefficients of variation, in a nonsexually dimorphic species, despite
   its isolation and small population size. Like other primates, moustached
   tamarins show lower variability in the dimensions of the first molars
   and increased variability in the dimensions of the final molars in the
   toothrow. Moustached tamarins from Padre Isla have a distinctive pattern
   of variability in the remaining teeth, including more stable tooth
   lengths in the anterior and posterior portions of the toothrow, and more
   stable tooth widths in the midregion of the toothrow. High variability
   in incisor width may be due to age effects of a distinctive diet and
   pattern of dental wear.},

Abstract = {Regional cerebral atrophy was evaluated in APP/PS1 mice harboring
   mutated transgenes linked to familial Alzheimer's disease, using
   complementary methods. In vivo high resolution MRI was selected for
   measurements of brain atrophy and associated cerebrospinal fluid
   dilation; histological analysis was performed to reveal localized
   atrophies and to evaluate amyloid burden.
   Young APP/PS1 mice examined at a pre-amyloid stage (10 weeks) showed
   disruption in development (reduced intracranial and brain volumes).
   Comparison of young and old (24 months) mice, indicated that both
   APP/PS1 and control brains endure growth during adulthood. Aged APP/PS1
   animals showed a moderate although significant global brain atrophy and
   a dilation of CSF space in posterior brain regions. The locus of this
   atrophy was identified in the midbrain area and not, as expected, at
   isocortical/hippocampal levels. Atrophy was also detected in fiber
   tracts. The severity of brain atrophy in old APP/PS1 mice was not
   correlated with the extent of cerebral amyloidosis. The relevance of
   current transgenic mouse models for the study of brain atrophy related
   to Alzheimer's disease is discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {This special issue emerged from a symposium held during the 20th
   Congress of the International Primatological Society in Torino, Italy,
   in August 2004. The symposium brought together scientists studying
   several different aspects of olfaction in primates. The topics addressed
   ranged from the morphology and physiology of the sensory apparatus, the
   genetics and chemistry of olfactory signals and the use of such signals
   in primate communication, to a comparative analysis of the role of
   olfaction in neural evolution. The papers in this issue reflect a surge
   of interest in diverse aspects of olfaction-an interest that has been
   stimulated by the more rigorous theoretical approaches and new
   techniques that have recently become available. This introduction
   briefly reviews past research on primate olfaction, summarizes the scope
   of this special issue, and provides a somewhat speculative glimpse of
   the future.},

Abstract = {The endemic species richness on Madagascar, relative to landmass area,
   is unparalleled in the world. Many organisms on the island have
   restricted geographical ranges. A comprehensive hypothesis explaining
   the evolution of this microendemism has yet to be developed. Using an
   analysis of watersheds in the context of Quaternary climatic shifts, we
   provide a new mechanistic model to explain the process of explosive
   speciation on the island. River catchments with sources at relatively
   low elevations were zones of isolation and hence led to the speciation
   of locally endemic taxa, whereas those at higher elevations were zones
   of retreat and dispersion and hence contain proportionately lower levels
   of microendemism. These results provide a framework for biogeographic
   and phylogeographic studies, as well as a basis for prioritizing
   conservation actions of the remaining natural forest habitats on the
   island.},

Title = {Phylogenetic analyses of dimorphism in primates: Evidence for stronger
   selection on canine size than on body size},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {130},
Number = {1},
Pages = {50-59},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Phylogenetic comparative methods were used to analyze the consequences
   of sexual selection on canine size and canine size dimorphism in
   primates. Our analyses of previously published body mass and canine size
   data revealed that the degree of sexual selection is correlated with
   canine size dimorphism, as well as with canine size in both sexes, in
   haplorhine but not in strepsirrhine primates. Consistent with these
   results, male and female canine size was found to be highly correlated
   in all primates. Since canine dimorphism and canine size in both sexes
   in haplorhines were found to be not only related to mating system but
   also to body size and body size dimorphism (characters which are also
   subject to or the result of sexual selection), it was not apparent
   whether the degree of canine dimorphism is the result of sexual
   selection on canine size itself, or whether canine dimorphism is instead
   a consequence of selection on body size, or vice versa. To distinguish
   among these possibilities, we conducted matched-pairs analyses on canine
   size after correcting for the effects of body size. These tests revealed
   significant effects of sexual selection on relative canine size,
   indicating that canine size is more important in haplorhine male-male
   competition than body size. Further analyses showed, however, that it
   was not possible to detect any evolutionary lag between canine size and
   body size, or between canine size dimorphism and body size dimorphism.
   Additional support for the notion of special selection on canine size
   consisted of allometric relationships in haplorhines between canine size
   and canine size dimorphism in males, as well as between canine size
   dimorphism and body size dimorphism. In conclusion, these analyses
   revealed that the effects of sexual selection on canine size are
   stronger than those on body size, perhaps indicating that canines are
   more important than body size in haplorhine male-male competition. Am J

Abstract = {In mammals, males maintain significantly higher testosterone (T, `the
   male hormone') levels than females throughout the year and are typically
   dominant over females. Our study of the cooperatively breeding rock
   hyrax (Procavia capensis) demonstrated a distinct exception. In most
   hyrax social groups that we studied, adult females were at the highest
   social rank within the group and showed higher than or equal T levels to
   males. To our knowledge, this is the first reported instance of adult
   female mammals demonstrating higher T levels than adult males. However,
   although T levels significantly correlated with rank in males, in
   females such correlations were not detected, suggesting a more complex
   interplay between behavior and endocrine factors in this species. (C)

Abstract = {Interpretation of the adaptive profile of ancestral primates is

   comparative weight distributions of arboreal mammals and a phylogenetic
   reconstruction of ancestral primate body mass indicate that the
   reduction of functional claws to nails - a primate characteristic that
   had up until now eluded satisfactory explanation - resulted from an
   increase in body mass to around 1000 g or more in the primate stem
   lineage. The associated shift to a largely vegetarian diet coincided
   with increased angiosperm diversity and the evolution of larger fruit

Title = {Social play in bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes):
   Implications for natural social systems and interindividual

Abstract = {This study compares adult play behavior in the two Pan species in order
   to test the effects of phylogenetic closeness and the nature of social
   systems on play distribution. The social play (both with fertile and
   immature subjects) performed by adults did not differ between the two
   species. In contrast, in bonobos, play levels among fertile subjects
   were higher than in chimpanzees. Findings regarding levels of undecided
   conflicts (more frequent in bonobos) and formal submission displays
   (lacking in bonobos) confirm, in the two colonies under study, that
   bonobos exhibit ``egalitarianism{''} more than chimpanzees. Some authors
   emphasized the importance of play-fighting for social assessment when
   relationships among individuals are not codified and structured
   according to rank-rules. Indeed, adult bonobos played more roughly than
   chimpanzees. Moreover, adult bonobos displayed the full play-face at a
   high frequency especially during rough play sessions, whereas in
   chimpanzees, the frequency of play signals was not affected by roughness
   of play. The frequency of social play among bonobo females was higher
   than in any other sex combinations, whereas no difference was found for
   chimpanzees. As a matter of fact, social play can be viewed as a balance
   between cooperation and competition. Among bonobo females, characterized
   by social competence and affiliation, social play might enhance their
   behavioral flexibility and increase their socially symmetrical
   relationships which, after all, are the basis for their egalitarian
   society.},

Abstract = {Previous researchers found positive scaling of body size and sexual size
   dimorphism (SSD) in primates, known as Rensch's rule. The pattern is
   present in Haplorhini, but absent in Strepsirhini. I found that positive
   evolutionary correlations between size and SSD drive positive scaling
   relationships within Haplorhini as a whole and Platyrrhini,
   Cercopithecinae, Colobinae, and Hominoidea individually at the generic
   level and higher, but that evolutionary correlations within genera in
   these clades are often nonsignificant or negative. I suggest that
   positive evolutionary correlations result from greater change in male
   than in female size, usually because of sexual selection acting on
   polygynous populations. I suggest that negative evolutionary
   correlations result from greater change in female size, owing to either
   natural selection or, in Callitrichidae, sexual selection acting on
   polyandrous populations. The high incidence of negative evolutionary
   correlations within Haplorhini suggests a relatively large influence of
   natural selection on SSD, at least with regard to differences in SSD
   between congeners. I propose two possible explanations for the
   difference in intrageneric and supergeneric evolutionary patterns: 1)
   natural selection is a relatively weak force for modifying SSD and has a
   noticeable effect only when one compares related species experiencing
   similar levels of sexual selection, and 2) natural selection is a
   relatively strong force for modifying SSD but is less likely than sexual
   selection to affect higher level taxonomic comparisons noticeably
   because of the cumulative effect over time of marginal differences in
   mortality rates of these two types of selection. I discuss types of data
   required to test these explanations and implications for reconstructing
   fossil behavior.},

Abstract = {Although it has been shown that in test collection based studies,
   stemming improves retrieval effectiveness in an information retrieval
   system, morphological variations of queries searching on the same topic
   are less well understood. This work examines the broad morphological
   variation that searchers of an Arabic retrieval system put into their
   queries. In this study, 15 native Arabic speakers were asked to generate
   queries, morphological variants of query words were collated across
   users. Queries composed of either the commonest or rarest variants of
   each word were submitted to a retrieval system and the effectiveness of
   the searches was measured. It was found that queries composed of the
   more popular morphological variants were more likely to retrieve
   relevant documents that those composed of less popular.},

Abstract = {We introduce the hypergeometric models KL, DLH and DLLH using the DFR
   approach, and we compare these models to other relevant models of IR.
   The hypergeometric models are based on the probability of observing two
   probabilities: the relative within-document term frequency and the
   entire collection term frequency. Hypergeometric models are
   parameter-free models of IR. Experiments show that these models have an
   excellent performance with small and very large collections. We provide
   their foundations from the same IR probability space of language
   modelling (LM). We finally discuss the difference between DFR and LM.
   Briefly, DFR is a frequentist (Type I), or combinatorial approach,
   whilst language models use a Bayesian (Type II) approach for mixing the
   two probabilities, being thus inherently parametric in its nature.},

Abstract = {Collaborative Web search is a form of meta-search that manipulates the
   results of underlying Web search engines in response to the learned
   preferences of a given community of users. Results that have previously
   been selected in response to similar queries by community members are
   promoted in the returned results. However, promotion is limited to these
   previously-selected results and in this paper we describe and evaluate
   how relevant results without a selection history can also be promoted by
   exploiting snippet-text and title similarities.},

Abstract = {In-place and merge-based index maintenance are the two main competing
   strategies for on-line index construction in dynamic information
   retrieval systems based on inverted lists. Motivated by recent results
   for both strategies, we investigate possible combinations of in-place
   and merge-based index maintenance. We present a hybrid approach in which
   long posting lists are updated in-place, while short lists are updated
   using a merge strategy. Our experimental results show that this hybrid
   approach achieves better indexing performance than either method
   (in-place, merge-based) alone.},

Abstract = {When presented with a retrieved document, users of a search engine are
   usually left with the task of pinning down the relevant information
   inside the document. Often this is done by a time-consuming combination
   of skimming, scrolling and Ctrl+F. In the setting of a digital library
   for scientific literature the issue is especially urgent when dealing
   with reference works, such as surveys and handbooks, as these typically
   contain long documents. Our aim is to develop methods for providing a
   ``go-read-here{''} type of retrieval functionality, which points the
   user to a segment where she can best start reading to find out about her
   topic of interest. We examine multiple query-independent ways of
   segmenting texts into coherent chunks that can be returned in response
   to a query. Most (experienced) authors use paragraph breaks to indicate
   topic shifts, thus providing us with one way of segmenting documents. We
   compare this structural method with semantic text segmentation methods,
   both with respect to topical focus and relevancy. Our experimental
   evidence is based on manually segmented scientific documents and a set
   of queries against this corpus. Structural segmentation based on
   contiguous blocks of relevant paragraphs is shown to be a viable
   solution for our intended application of providing ``go-read-here{''}
   functionality.},

Abstract = {Although mobile information retrieval is seen as the next frontier of
   the search market, the rendering of results on mobile devices is still
   unsatisfactory. We present CREDINO, a clustering engine for PDAs based
   on the theory of concept lattices that can help overcome some specific
   challenges posed by small-screen, narrow-band devices. CREDINO is
   probably the first clustering engine for mobile devices freely available
   for testing on the Web. An experimental evaluation, besides confirming
   that finding information is more difficult on a PDA than on a desktop
   computer, suggests that mobile clustering engine is more effective than
   mobile search engine.},

Abstract = {Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is an established dimensionality
   reduction technique for Information Retrieval applications. However, LSI
   generated dimensions are not optimal in a classification setting, since
   LSI fails to exploit class labels of training documents. We propose an
   approach that uses class information to influence LSI dimensions whereby
   class labels of training documents are endoded as new terms, which are
   appended to the documents. When LSI is carried out on the augmented
   term-document matrix, terms pertaining to the same class are pulled
   closer to each other. Evaluation over experimental data reveals
   significant improvement in classification accuracy over LSI. The results
   also compare favourably with naive Support Vector Machines.},

   structure is an extension of previous index structures for phrases and
   achieves better query efficiency with negligible extra storage cost. In
   our experimental evaluation, a common phrase index has 5\% and 20\%
   improvement in query time for the overall and large queries (queries of
   long phrases) respectively over an auxiliary nextword index. Moreover,
   it uses only 1\% extra storage cost. Compared with an inverted index,
   our improvement is 40\% and 72\% for the overall and large queries

Abstract = {Textual Entailment has recently been proposed as an application
   independent task of recognising whether the meaning of one text may be
   inferred from another. This is potentially a key task in many NLP
   applications. In this contribution, we investigate the use of various
   lexical entailment models in Information Retrieval, using the language
   modelling framework. We show that lexical entailment potentially
   provides a significant boost in performance, similar to pseudo-relevance
   feedback, but at a lower computational cost. In addition, we show that
   the performance is relatively stable with respect to the corpus the
   lexical entailment measure is estimated on.},

Abstract = {Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) is concerned with the retrieval
   of documents based on both thematic and geographic content. An important
   issue in GIR, as for all IR, is relevance. In this paper we argue that
   spatial relevance should be considered independently from thematic
   relevance, and propose an initial scheme. A pilot study to assess this
   relevance scheme is presented, with initial results suggesting that
   users can distinguish between these two relevance dimensions, and that
   furthermore they have different properties. We suggest that spatial
   relevance requires greater assessor effort and more localised geographic
   knowledge than judging thematic relevance.},

Abstract = {Motion capturing has become an important tool in fields such as sports
   sciences, biometrics, and particularly in computer animation, where
   large collections of motion material are accumulated in the production
   process. In order to fully exploit motion databases for reuse and for
   the synthesis of new motions, one needs efficient retrieval and browsing
   methods to identify similar motions. So far, only ad-hoc methods for
   content-based motion retrieval have been proposed, which lack efficiency
   and rely on quantitative, numerical similarity measures, making it
   difficult to identify logically related motions. We propose an efficient
   motion retrieval system based on the query-by-example paradigm, which
   employs qualitative, geometric; similarity measures. This allows for
   intuitive and interactive browsing in a purely content-based fashion
   without relying on textual annotations. We have incorporated this
   technology in a novel user interface facilitating query formulation as
   well as visualization and ranking of search results.},

Abstract = {Current research in the field of automatic plagiarism detection for text
   documents focuses on algorithms that compare plagiarized documents
   against potential original documents. Though these approaches perform
   well in identifying copied or even modified passages, they assume a
   closed world: a reference collection must be given against which a
   plagiarized document can be compared.
   This raises the question whether plagiarized passages within a document
   can be detected automatically if no reference is given, e. g. if the
   plagiarized passages stem from a book that is not available in digital
   form. We call this problem class intrinsic plagiarism detection. The
   paper is devoted to this problem class; it shows that it is possible to
   identify potentially plagiarized passages by analyzing a single document
   with respect to variations in writing style.
   Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a taxonomy of plagiarism delicts
   along with detection methods, (ii) new features for the quantification
   of style aspects, (iii) a publicly available plagiarism corpus for
   benchmark comparisons, and (iv) promising results in non-trivial
   plagiarism detection settings: in our experiments we achieved recall
   values of 85\% with a precision of 75\% and better.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a SIMO system of trans horizon transmission through
   the ionospheric channel in the HF band (330 MHz). The technical
   challenge is to increase significantly the data transfer rate if
   compared with standard modems (typically 4.8 kbits/s in a 3 kHz
   bandwidth). A multi channel receiving system is connected to an original
   array of collocated antennas : this device appears as polarization
   sensitive and, consequently, makes the separation of the incident multi
   paths efficient though there is no spatial diversity. A blind spatio
   temporal equalization, based on the Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA),
   balances the distortions of the spectrum in an extended bandwidth of 9
   kHz. An experimental radio link has been tested with a range of 1300 km.
   The corresponding results underline the improvement of the bit transfer
   rate which attains 30 kbits/s in a 9 kHz bandwidth resorting to a 16 QAM
   waveform.},

   news stories, that an optimal number of terms can be identified to
   compose a new query for feedback and that in most cases; the number of
   documents employed for feedback does not have a great effect on these
   optimal numbers of terms.},

Abstract = {As a behavioural strategy, cathemerality is thought to confer
   considerable advantages by allowing animals to extend activity flexibly
   into either the diurnal or nocturnal phase in response to the prevailing
   ecological conditions. Factors such as temperature, access to food
   sources and minimising the risk of predation are all thought to be
   important in promoting cathemerality, although previous studies have
   produced inconsistent results. This paper adopts a different approach by
   first asking whether an obligate diurnal species, the chacma baboon (
   Papio hamadryas ursinus), exhibits seasonal variation in behavioural
   flexibility in response to annual cycles of day length. While short day
   lengths are an important constraint on the activity of the baboons at De
   Hoop Nature Reserve, South Africa, long summer days permit considerable
   flexibility in thermoregulatory response, diet selection and patterns of
   habitat choice. Given that baboons adapt flexibly in response to a
   relaxation of time constraints, the question thus arises as to why
   diurnal and nocturnal primates do not adopt cathemeral activity patterns
   when time is constrained? For baboons, the costs of predation appear to
   prohibit exploitation of the nocturnal phase and it is likely that such
   constraints are true of most primates. It thus follows that Madagascar's
   predatory environment must in some way permit or select for a cathemeral
   lifestyle. The importance of the predation by fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox)
   on the evolution of cathemerality is discussed. Copyright (c) 2006 S.

Abstract = {The quality of search engines depends usually on the content of the
   returned documents rather than on the text used to express this content.
   So ideally, search techniques should be directed more toward the
   semantic dependencies underlying documents than toward the texts
   themselves. The most visible examples in this direction are Latent
   Semantic Analysis (LSA), and the Hyperspace Analog to Language (HAL). If
   these techniques are really based on semantic dependencies, as they
   contend, then they should be applicable across languages.
   To investigate this contention we used electronic versions of two kinds
   of material with their translations: a novel, and a popular treatise
   about cosmology. We used the analogy of fingerprinting as employed in
   forensics to establish whether individuals are related. Genetic
   fingerprinting uses enzymes to split the DNA and then compare the
   resulting band patterns. Likewise, in our research we used queries to
   split a document into fragments. If a search technique really isolates
   fragments semantically related to the query, then a document and its
   translation should have similar band patterns.
   In this paper we (1) present the fingerprinting technique, (2) introduce
   the material used, and (3) report results of an evaluation for two
   semantic indexing techniques.},

Abstract = {Presentation of search results in Web-based information retrieval (IR)
   systems has been dominated by a textual form of information such as the
   title, snippet, URL, and/or file type of retrieved documents. On the
   other hand, document's visual aspects such as the layout, colour scheme,
   or presence of images have been studied in a limited context with regard
   to their effectiveness of search result presentation. This paper
   presents a comparative evaluation of textual and visual forms of
   document summaries as the additional document surrogate in the search
   result presentation. In our study, a sentence-based summarisation
   technique was used to create a textual document summary, and the
   thumbnail image of web pages was used to represent a visual summary. The
   experimental results suggest that both have the cases where the
   additional elements contributed to a positive effect not only in users'
   relevance assessment but also in query re/formulation. The results also
   suggest that the two forms of document summary are likely to have
   different contexts to facilitate user's search experience. Therefore,
   our study calls for further research on adaptive models of IR systems to
   make use of their advantages in appropriate contexts.},

Abstract = {The effectiveness of the information retrieval systems is largely
   dependent on term-weighting. Most current term-weighting approaches
   involve the use of term frequency normalization. We develop here a
   method to assess the potential role of the term frequency-inverse
   document frequency measures that are commonly used in text retrieval
   systems. Since automatic information retrieval systems have to deal with
   documents of varying sizes and terms of varying frequencies, we carried
   out preliminary tests to evaluate the effect of term-weighing items on
   the retrieval performance. With regard to the preliminary tests, we
   identify a novel factor (effective level of term frequency) that
   represents the document content based on its length and maximum
   term-frequency. This factor is used to find the maximum main terms
   within the documents and an appropriate subset of documents containing
   the query terms. We show that, all document terms need not be considered
   for ranking a document with respect to a query. Regarding the result of
   the experiments, the effective level of term frequency (EL) is a
   significant factor in retrieving relevant documents, especially in large
   collections. Experiments were undertaken on TREC collections to evaluate
   the effectiveness of our proposal.},

Abstract = {Experiments on the effectiveness of relevance feedback with real users
   are time-consuming and expensive. This makes simulation for rapid
   testing desirable. We define a user model, which helps to quantify some
   interaction decisions involved in simulated relevance feedback. First,
   the relevance criterion defines the relevance threshold of the user to
   accept documents as relevant to his/her needs. Second, the browsing
   effort refers to the patience of the user to browse through the initial
   list of retrieved documents in order to give feedback. Third, the
   feedback effort refers to the effort and ability of the user to collect
   feedback documents. We use the model to construct several simulated
   relevance feedback scenarios in a laboratory setting. Using TREC data
   providing graded relevance assessments, we study the effect of the
   quality and quantity of the feedback documents on the effectiveness of
   the relevance feedback and compare this to the pseudo-relevance
   feedback. Our results indicate that one can compensate large amounts of
   relevant but low quality feedback by small amounts of highly relevant
   feedback.},

Abstract = {PageRank inherently is massively parallelizable and distributable, as a
   result of web's strict host-based link locality. We show that the Gau
   beta-Seidel iterative method can actually be applied in such a parallel
   ranking scenario in order to improve convergence. By introducing a
   two-dimensional web model and by adapting the PageRank to this
   environment, we present efficient methods to compute the exact rank
   vector even for large-scale web graphs in only a few minutes and
   iteration steps, with intrinsic support. for incremental web crawling,
   and without the need for page sorting/reordering or for sharing global
   rank information.},

Abstract = {Our cultural heritage; as preserved in libraries, archives and museums,
   is made up of documents written many centuries ago. Large-scale
   digitization initiatives make these documents available to nonexpert
   users through digital libraries and vertical search engines. For a user,
   querying a historic document, collection may be a disappointing
   experience: queries involving modern words may not be very effective for
   retrieving documents that contain many historic terms. We propose a
   cross-language approach to historic document retrieval, and investigate
   (1) the automatic construction of translation resources for historic
   languages, and (2) the retrieval of historic documents using
   cross-language information retrieval techniques. Our experimental
   evidence is based on a collection of 17th century Dutch documents and a
   set of 25 known-item topics in modern Dutch. Our main findings are as
   follows: First, we are able to automatically construct rules for
   modernizing historic language based on comparing (a) phonetic sequence
   similarity, (b) the relative frequency of consonant and vowel sequences,
   and (c) the relative frequency of character n-gram sequences, of
   historic and modern corpora. Second, modern queries are not very
   effective for retrieving historic documents, but the historic language
   tools lead to a substantial improvement in retrieval effectiveness. The
   improvements are above and beyond the improvement due to using a modern
   stemming algorithm (whose effectiveness actually goes up when the
   historic language is modernized).},

   on average, more engaged in technology, entertainment, and politics than
   web searchers, with a particular interest in current, events. The user

Abstract = {Studies investigating heterothermy under natural conditions are
   particularly scarce for tropical species. However, heterothermy patterns
   in tropical and subtropical environments often differ markedly from
   those observed in arctic and temperate species. The investigation of
   heterothermy in strepsirhine primates has focussed largely on the
   Malagasy cheirogaleids. In addition, a physiological verification of
   torpor occurrence in mainland strepsirhines is important with regard to
   arguments pertaining to the colonization of Madagascar by strepsirhine
   primates. We measured body temperatures of 11 free-ranging Galago
   moholi, between February 2002 and September 2003, for 3 consecutive
   months for each animal. No incidents of heterothermy were recorded
   throughout the study period. We considered how physiological and
   ecological aspects of G. moholi biology might have obviated the use of
   torpor. It was suggested that the breeding pattern observed in G. moholi
   prevented torpor use whilst increasing fecundity, and that the
   ecological costs of torpor far outweighed the energetic costs. This
   study highlights the need for more studies on free- ranging animals to
   elucidate the physiological, ecological and phylogenetic constraints and
   determinants of torpor use. Furthermore, if convincing arguments are to
   be made regarding the possible role of heterothermy in species
   dispersal, more data from free-ranging animals are needed. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {Efficient and effective routing of content-based queries is an emerging
   problem in peer-to-peer networks, and can be seen as an extension of the
   traditional ``resource selection{''} problem. Although some approaches
   have been proposed, finding the best architecture (defined by the
   network topology, the underlying selection method, and its integration
   into peer-to-peer networks) is still an open problem. This paper
   investigates different building blocks of such architectures, among them
   the decision-theoretic framework, CORI, hierarchical networks,
   distributed hash tables and HyperCubes. The evaluation on a large
   test-bed shows that the decision-theoretic framework can be applied
   effectively and cost-efficiently onto peer-to-peer networks.},

Abstract = {In this paper we show how approximate matrix factorisations can be used
   to organise document summaries returned by a search engine into
   meaningful thematic categories. We compare four different factorisations
   (SVD, NMF, LNMF and K-Means/Concept Decomposition) with respect to topic
   separation capability, outlier detection and label quality. We also
   compare our approach with two other clustering algorithms: Suffix Tree
   Clustering (STC) and Tolerance Rough Set Clustering (TRC). For our
   experiments we use the standard merge-then-cluster approach based on the
   Open Directory Project web catalogue as a source of human-clustered
   document summaries.},

Abstract = {This paper. presents two sentence retrieval methods. We adopt the task
   definition done in the TREC Novelty Track: sentence retrieval consists
   in the extraction of the relevant sentences for a query from a set of
   relevant documents for that query. We have compared the performance of
   the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) retrieval model against the
   performance of a topic identification method, also based on Singular
   Value Decomposition (SVD)-but with a different sentence selection
   method. We used the TREC Novelty Track collections from years 2002 and
   2003 for the evaluation. The results of our experiments show that these
   techniques, particularly sentence retrieval based on topic
   identification, are valid alternative approaches to other more ad-hoc
   methods devised for this task.},

   Query profiles provide useful summarized previews on the retrieved
   answers to a given query. They outline ambiguity in the query and when
   combined with appropriate means of interactivity allow the user to
   easily adapt the final ranking. Statistical analysis of the profiles
   even enables the retrieval system to automatically suggest search
   restrictions or preferences. The paper shows a preliminary experimental
   study of the proposed feedback methods within the setting of TREC's

Abstract = {Keyword-based queries are an important means to retrieve information
   from XML collections with unknown or complex schemas. Relevance Feedback
   integrates relevance information provided by a user to enhance retrieval
   quality. For keyword-based XML queries, feedback engines usually
   generate an expanded keyword query from the content of elements marked
   as relevant or nonrelevant. This approach that is inspired by text-based
   IR completely ignores the semistructured nature of XML. This paper makes
   the important step from pure content-based to structural feedback. It
   presents a framework that expands a keyword query into a full-fledged
   content-and-structure query. Extensive experiments with the established
   INEX benchmark and our TopX search engine show the feasibility of our
   approach.},

Abstract = {Madagascar is a global biodiversity hotspot threatened by forest loss,
   degradation and fragmentation, all of which are detrimental to the
   future survival of forest-dwelling organisms. For conservation purposes
   it is essential to determine how species respond to habitat disturbance,
   specifically deforestation. In this study we investigated the impacts of
   deforestation on three vertebrate communities, lizards, small mammals
   and birds, in an area of spiny forest subjected to anthropogenic forest
   clearance. Spiny forest has high levels of endemism, but conservation in
   this unique ecosystem is hindered by the lack of research. We undertook
   standardised trapping, time-constrained and timed species searches to
   assess species richness, species abundance and community composition of
   lizards, small mammals and birds in six areas of `forest' and six
   `cleared' areas. From surveys and opportunistic sightings we recorded a
   total of 70 species of birds, 14 species of mammals and 38 species of
   reptiles and amphibians. We found forest clearing to have a negative
   effect on species richness and community structure of all groups and
   identified loss of canopy cover as a driving factor behind this.
   However, the response and sensitivity to clearing varied between groups
   and species. Lizards (50\%) and small mammals (40\%) had the greatest
   decline in species richness in response to clearing as compared to birds
   (26\%), although birds showed the greatest shift in community structure.
   The community in cleared areas contained more generalist and introduced
   species that have wider geographic ranges and habitat preferences, than
   those unique to the spiny forest. We found the first suite of species to
   suffer from forest clearance were those of high conservation priority
   due to their restricted geographic range. Our findings are discussed in
   relation to future spiny forest conservation and management. (c) 2005

   applications are user-specific; classification of retrieved Web contents
   into personalized topic hierarchies as well as automatic refinements of
   such taxonomies using unsupervised machine-learning methods (e.g.

   to construct the advanced decision model that takes the generalization
   performance of multiple `local' peer models into account. In addition,
   meta algorithms can be applied in a restrictive manner, i.e. by leaving
   out some `uncertain' documents. The results of our systematic evaluation
   show the viability of the proposed approach.},

Abstract = {The growing amount of online news posted on the WWW demands new
   algorithms that support topic detection, search, and navigation of news
   documents. This work presents an algorithm for topic detection that
   considers the temporal evolution of news and the structure of web
   documents. Then, it uses the results of the topic detection algorithm
   for searching and navigating in an online news source. An experimental
   evaluation with a collection of online news in Spanish indicates the
   advantages of incorporating the temporal aspect and structure of
   documents in the topic detection of news. In addition, topic-based
   clusters are well suited for guiding the search and navigation of news.},

Abstract = {URL usually contains meaningful information for measuring the relevance
   of a Web page to a query in Web search. Some existing works utilize URL
   depth priors (i.e. the probability of being a good page given the length
   and depth of a URL) for improving some types of Web search tasks. This
   paper suggests the use of the location of query terms occur in a URL for
   measuring how well a web page is matched with a user's information need
   in web search. First, we define and estimate URL hit types, i.e. the
   priori probability of being a good answer given the type of query term
   hits in the URL. The main advantage of URL hit priors (over depth
   priors) is that it can achieve stable improvement for both informational
   and navigational queries. Second, an obstacle of exploiting such priors
   is that shortening and concatenation are frequently used in a URL. Our
   investigation shows that only 30\% URL hits are recognized by an
   ordinary word breaking approach. Thus we combine three methods to
   improve matching. Finally, the priors are integrated into the
   probabilistic model for enhancing web document retrieval. Our
   experiments were conducted using 7 query sets of TREC2002, TREC2003 and
   TREC2004, and show that the proposed approach is stable and improve
   retrieval effectiveness by 4\%similar to 11\% for navigational queries
   and 10\% for informational queries.},

Abstract = {Structured document retrieval focusses on the retrieval of relevant

   structural and textual aspects.
   We focus here on the theory behind Bricks, a visual query formulation
   technique for structured document retrieval that aims at reducing the
   complexity of the query formulation process and required knowledge of
   the underlying document structure for the user, while maintaining full
   expression power, as offered by the NEXI query language for XML
   retrieval.
   In addition, we present the outcomes of a large scale usability
   experiment, which compared Bricks to a keyword-based and a NEXI-based
   interface. The results show that participants were more successful at
   completing a search assignments using Bricks. Furthermore, we observed
   that the participants were also able to successfully complete complex
   search assignments significantly faster, when using the Bricks

   Transportation Distance (PTD) is proposed in this paper. The proposed
   measure improves on the previously proposed similarity measure based on
   optimal matching by allowing many-to-many matching between subtopics of
   documents. After documents are decomposed into sets of subtopics, the
   Proportional Transportation Distance is employed to evaluate the
   similarity between sets of subtopics for two documents by solving a
   transportation problem. Experiments on TDT-3 data demonstrate its good
   ability for measuring document similarity and also its high robustness,
   i.e. it does not rely on the underlying document decomposition algorithm
   largely as the optimal matching based measure.},

Abstract = {Implicit acquisition of user preferences makes log-based collaborative
   filtering favorable in practice to accomplish recommendations. In this
   paper, we follow a formal approach in text retrieval to re-formulate the
   problem. Based on the classic probability ranking principle, we propose
   a probabilistic user-item relevance model. Under this formal model, we
   show that user-based and item-based approaches are only two different
   factorizations with different independence assumptions. Moreover, we
   show that smoothing is an important aspect to estimate the parameters of
   the models due to data sparsity. By adding linear interpolation
   smoothing, the proposed model gives a probabilistic justification of
   using TFxIDF-like item ranking in collaborative filtering. Besides
   giving the insight understanding of the problem of collaborative
   filtering, we also show experiments in which the proposed method
   provides a better recommendation performance on a music play-list data
   set.},

Abstract = {A new Relevance Feedback (RF) technique is developed to improve upon the
   efficiency and performance of existing techniques. This is based on
   propagating positive and negative weights from documents judged relevant
   and not relevant respectively, to other documents, which are deemed
   similar according to one of a number of criteria. The performance and
   efficiency improve since the documents are treated as independent
   vectors rather than being merged into a single vector as is the case
   with traditional approaches, and only the documents considered in a
   given neighbourhood are inspected. This is especially important when
   using large test collections.},

Abstract = {Reading news is one of the most popular activities when people surf the
   internet. As too many news sources provide independent news information
   and each has its own preference, detecting unbiased important news might
   be very useful for users to keep up to date with what are happening in
   the world. In this paper we present a novel method to identify important
   news in web environment which consists of diversified online news sites.
   We observe that a piece of important news generally occupies visually
   significant place in some homepage of a news site and import news event
   will be reported by many news sites. To explore these two properties, we
   model the relationship between homepages, news and latent events by a
   tripartite graph, and present an algorithm to identify important news in
   this model. Based on this algorithm, we implement a system TOPSTORY to
   dynamically generate homepages for users to browse important news
   reports. Our experimental study indicates the effectiveness of proposed
   approach.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a machine-learning approach for ranking web
   documents according to the proportion of procedural text they contain.
   By `procedural text' we refer to ordered lists of steps, which are very
   common in some instructional genres such as online manuals. Our initial
   training corpus is built up by applying some simple heuristics to select
   documents from a large collection and contains only a few documents with
   a large proportion of procedural texts. We adapt the Naive Bayes
   classifier to better fit this less than ideal training corpus. This
   adapted model is compared with several other classifiers in ranking
   procedural texts using different sets of features and is shown to
   perform well when only highly distinctive features are used.},

Abstract = {Parallel corpora are a valuable resource for tasks such as
   cross-language information retrieval and data-driven natural language
   processing systems. Previously only small scale corpora have been
   available, thus restricting their practical use. This paper describes a
   system that overcomes this limitation by automatically collecting high
   quality parallel bilingual corpora from the web. Previous systems used a
   single principle feature for parallel web page verification, whereas we
   use multiple features to identify parallel texts via a
   k-nearest-neighbor classifier. Our system was evaluated using a data set
   containing 6500 Chinese-English candidate parallel pairs that have been
   manually annotated. Experiments show that the use of a
   k-nearest-neighbors classifier with multiple features achieves
   substantial improvements over the systems that use any one of these
   features. The system achieved a precision rate of 95\% and a recall rate
   of 97\%, and thus is a significant improvement over earlier work.},

Abstract = {Genomic IR, characterized by its highly specific information need,
   severe synonym and polysemy problem, long term name and rapid growing
   literature size, is challenging IR community. In this paper, we are
   focused on addressing the synonym and polysemy issue within the language
   model framework. Unlike the ways translation model and traditional query
   expansion techniques approach this issue, we incorporate concept-based
   indexing into a basic language model for genomic IR. In particular, we
   adopt UMLS concepts as indexing and searching terms. A UMLS concept
   stands for a unique meaning in the biomedicine domain; a set of
   synonymous terms will share same concept ID. Therefore, the new approach
   makes the document ranking effective while maintaining the simplicity of
   language models. A comparative experiment on the TREC 2004 Genomics
   Track data shows significant improvements are obtained by incorporating
   concept-based indexing into a basic language model. The MAP (mean
   average precision) is significantly raised from 29.17\% (the baseline
   system) to 36.94\%. The performance of the new approach is also
   significantly superior to the mean (21.72\%) of official runs
   participated in TREC 2004 Genomics Track and is comparable to the
   performance of the best run (40.75\%). Most official runs including the
   best run extensively use various query expansion and pseudo-relevance
   feedback techniques while our approach does nothing except for the
   incorporation of concept-based indexing, which evidences the view that
   semantic smoothing, i.e. the incorporation of synonym and sense
   information into the language models, is a more standard approach to
   achieving the effects traditional query expansion and pseudo-relevance
   feedback techniques target.},

Abstract = {Understanding the rules that link communication and social behaviour is
   an essential prerequisite for discerning how a communication system as
   complex as human language might have evolved. The comparative method
   offers a powerful tool for investigating the nature of these rules,
   since it provides a means to examine relationships between changes in
   communication abilities and changes in key aspects of social behaviour
   over evolutionary time. Here we present empirical evidence from
   phylogenetically controlled analyses indicating that evolutionary
   increases in the size of the vocal repertoire among non-human primate
   species were associated with increases in both group size and time spent
   grooming (our measure of extent of social bonding).},

Abstract = {This report presents initial results of a multimodal analysis of tissue
   volume and microstructure in the brain of an aye-aye (Daubentonia
   madagascariensis). The left hemisphere of an aye-aye brain was scanned
   using T2-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
   diffasion-tensor imaging (DTI) prior to histological processing and
   staining for Nissl substance and myelinated fibers. The objectives of
   the experiment were to estimate the volume of gross brain regions for
   comparison with published data on other prosimians and to validate DTI
   data on fiber anisotropy with histological measurements of fiber spread.
   Measurements of brain structure volumes in the specimen are consistent
   with those reported in the literature: the aye-aye has a very large
   brain for its body size, a reduced volume of visual structures (V1 and
   LGN), and an increased volume of the olfactory lobe. This trade-off
   between visual and olfactory reliance is likely a reflection of the
   nocturnal extractive foraging behavior practiced by Daubentonia.
   Additionally, frontal cortex volume is large in the aye-aye, a feature
   that may also be related to its complex foraging behavior and
   sensorimotor demands. Analysis of DTI data in the anterior cingulum
   bundle demonstrates a strong correlation between fiber spread as
   measured from histological sections and fiber spread as measured from
   DTI. These results represent the first quantitative comparison of DTI
   data and fiber-stained histology in the brain. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The capital and income breeding framework has only recently been used to
   explain variation in female reproductive strategies in primates. The
   application of this framework to primates and other mammals with long
   reproductive cycles has not been consistent. We evaluated data on
   Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi) in the Kirindy
   Forest of western Madagascar to determine whether they are capital or
   income breeders. We found that Verreaux's sifaka can be classified as
   either capital or income breeders, depending on how these concepts are
   operationalized. These conflicting findings highlight why the
   capital/income framework is currently problematic and must be
   standardized if it is to be a useful framework for primatologists.},

Abstract = {Sixteen sifakas (11 Propithecus verreauxi coquereli, 2 Propithecus
   verreauxi verreauxi form majori, and 3 Propithecus tattersalli) were
   videotaped as they fed on leaves in an arboreal context. The hand used
   to feed and the hand used to maintain postural stability was coded. For
   each subject, the lateral bias of the hand used to feed was opposite the
   hand used in postural support. Seven sifakas displayed no bias for
   feeding or posture-related hand use, 7 sifakas displayed significant
   feeding-related reach preferences for pulling branches to the mouth (5
   left- and 2 right-hand preferences), and 9 sifakas exhibited significant
   hand preferences for postural support (2 left-, 7 right-hand preferent).
   Although these data do not strongly support the postural origins theory
   of behavioral lateralization, the modal preference pattern for sifakas
   that displayed significant hand preferences for posture and feeding
   involve a left bias for feeding and a right bias for postural support.},

Title = {Sex differences in scent-marking in Sifaka: Mating conflict or male

Volume = {128},
Number = {2},
Pages = {389-398},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Male and female interests can either be in conflict or serve as a basis
   for exchange. Communication is thus an important aspect of intersexual
   relationships. Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi uerreauxi), like
   many prosimians, uses chemical signals as one form of communication. The
   goals of this study were to determine 1) if males and females exhibit
   sex differences in their scent-marking behavior, and 2) if scent-marking
   is an example of mating conflict or cooperation. All occurrences of
   scent-marks, scent-mark context, and scent-mark style were collected on
   23 sifaka in the Kirindy Forest of western Madagascar for 7 months
   (September 2001-March 2002). Scent-mark rates were collected using
   continuous focal animal sampling from November 2000-March 2002.
   Homerange data were collected using monthly censuses and instantaneous
   focal sampling throughout those 17 months. The pressures of behavioral
   ecology seem to have shaped scent-marking in sifaka: the sexes exhibited
   significantly different scent-marking behavior. Results from this study
   are consistent with the hypotheses that 1) females scent-mark to
   advertise their presence and mark their resources, 2) clean-chested
   males use scent-marks as between-group communication to advertise their
   presence, and 3) stained-chested males use scent-marks as a form of
   olfactory mate-guarding. Scent-marking does not appear to be a
   ``service{''} that males provide to females, because overmarking limits
   female communication rather than adding to the overall number of
   scentmarks. Scent-marking behavior is a crucial aspect of the mating
   conflict and for understanding intersexual relationships in sifaka.},

Abstract = {The steroid hormone cortisol has been associated with different levels
   of ``stress{''} as well as different reproductive conditions in many
   primates. In callitrichids, cortisol has more often been reflective of
   female reproductive status than of chronic stress. In this study, we
   addressed the hypothesis that wild golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus
   rosalia) females, whose social structure is characterized by low
   aggression and high social support, would not show rank
   ({''}stress{''})-related differences in glucocorticoids but would show
   reproductive changes. We collected 710 fecal samples from 22 adult
   females in Pogo das Antas Reserve, Brazil, and nearby reintroduction
   areas, and assayed them for cortisol. Differences in cortisol levels
   were found between different reproductive conditions. Females in the
   first trimester of pregnancy had lower cortisol levels than nonpregnant
   females, although we did not differentiate between basal and ovulating
   levels in nonpregnant females. Cortisol rose in the third trimester of
   pregnancy. Primiparous females had a higher rise in the third trimester
   than multiparous females. No differences in cortisol levels were found
   among dominant females, ovulatory subordinate females, or anovulatory
   subordinate females. These results are similar to those obtained in
   other studies of callitrichid females. The lack of differences in
   cortisol excretion between dominants and subordinates is likely due to
   the low levels of overt aggression and the high level of social support
   available to subordinate females.},

Abstract = {Nocturnal prosimian primates are often seen alone during their nocturnal
   activities, and are therefore categorized as ``solitary.{''} Recent
   research has shown that these animals actually possess social networks
   that differ among species. Here we present new information on one of the
   lesser studied prosimian primates, the potto, derived from fieldwork in
   Cameroon that employed radiotelemetry and behavioral observations. An
   analysis of association patterns and home-range overlaps between animals
   revealed that pottos associated more frequently with conspecifics than
   expected for a supposedly solitary primate. Certain males and females
   that were seen together regularly throughout the study, but were not
   observed to have contact with other pottos of the opposite sex, were
   labeled as ``pairs.{''} These pairs were found to have higher levels of
   association with each other than with other conspecifics. The only
   affiliative and sexual behaviors observed between members of the
   opposite sex occurred within the pairs of pottos. Although given the
   secretive nature of these primates, the possibility of extrapair
   copulations cannot be ruled out, their relatively small testis size
   indicates that sperm competition is not so important for this species.},

Title = {Leaping behavior of Pithecia pithecia and Chiropotes satanas in eastern
   Venezuela},

Abstract = {I observed leaping behavior in the white-faced saki (Pithecta pithecia)
   and the black-bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas satanas) for 15 and 10
   months, respectively, as part of a larger study of positional behavior
   in the tribe Pitheciini. I used focal animal instantaneous sampling to
   observe the two species on separate islands in their natural habitat at
   Guri Lake, Venezuela. Leaping behavior correlates with patterns of
   forest use and body size, and differences between the species relate
   more to habitat preferences than to habitat differences per se. Pithecia
   usually chose vertical or highly angled supports of lower tree portions
   for take-off and landing, and took off from a stationary posture.
   Chiropotes took off from the main crown or terminal branches, gaining
   momentum from locomotor movement before performing a leaping take-off.
   Pithecia's vertical body orientation and longer leap distance allowed it
   to assume a mid-flight tuck to prepare for a hindlimb-first landing onto
   a solid support, and to absorb landing forces with its relatively longer
   hindlimbs. Chiropotes remained more pronograde throughout its leaps, and
   minimized landing forces by landing on all four limbs onto numerous
   flexible supports in the terminal branches. The smaller-bodied P.
   pithecia is specialized for vertical clinging and leaping, and exhibits
   behavioral and morphological parallels with other vertical clingers and
   leapers. The larger C. satanas is a generalized leaper that lacks
   morphological specializations for leaping. Pithecia's use of solid
   supports in the lower tree portions allows it to move quietly through
   the forest-one of a suite of behaviors related to predator avoidance.
   This example of variation within one behavioral category has
   implications for devising locomotor classifications and interpreting
   fossil remains.},

Abstract = {Reconciliation appears to repair the relationships of former opponents
   after being disturbed by aggressive interactions. Despite a consensus
   about the benefit of reconciliation, how former opponents achieve this
   benefit remains unclear. Variation within reconciliation is evident in
   many species, but understanding what causes the variation has been
   mostly neglected until now. We collected 178 events of reconciliation of
   both sexes in a community of wild chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes) in the
   Tai National Park, C (o) over cap te d'Ivoire. Our data provide evidence
   for the relationship-repair function of reconciliation, as aggression
   disturbed tolerance levels among former opponents and reconciliation
   restored tolerance to normal levels again. Partners with highly bene.
   cial relationships reconciled more often compared with partners of low
   mutual benefit. Latency and duration of reconciliation varied in
   combination, such that short reconciliations were initiated soon after
   the conflict, while long reconciliations were initiated later. Latency
   increased with the risk of further aggression, while duration decreased
   when costs were incurred from interruption of bene. cial activities. In
   contrast, the complexity of reconciliation varied according to the
   intensity of the preceding conflct, such that reconciliation was more
   complex after more intense conflicts. Our results suggest that
   relationships between opponents are increasingly disturbed with
   increasing conflict intensity and reconciliation repairs all
   relationships independent of their relationship value. We propose that
   the function of reconciliation is to reduce the disturbance created by
   aggression, but the more frequent the reconciliation, the more bene.
   cial it is for former opponents.onents.},

Title = {Alarm calls of white-faced capuchin monkeys: an acoustic analysis},
Journal = {ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {70},
Number = {1},
Pages = {165-176},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus) are threatened by several types of
   predators, including various aerial, arboreal and terrestrial predators.
   Whenever they encounter one of these threats, capuchin monkeys show
   different escape strategies and utter one of several types of alarm
   calls. These alarm calls constitute two acoustic categories, each of
   which is composed of several subtypes: the first category is composed of
   alarm calls given in response to aerial predators, humans and other
   capuchin monkeys, and the second is composed of alarm calls given in
   response to terrestrial predators and snakes. However, within these two
   broad categories the different subtypes of alarm calls appeared to show
   a graded continuum with transitions in between. Therefore, we performed
   an acoustic analysis to determine whether alarm calls between and within
   categories are characterized by distinct acoustic features. First, the
   two broad alarm call categories differed in call structure. Second,
   alarm calls of the first category, given in response to aerial
   predators, humans and other monkeys, differed in several acoustic
   variables and thus may convey context-specific information about the
   type of threat to listeners. Third, alarm calls of the second category,
   given in response to terrestrial predators and snakes, also differed in
   several acoustic variables; however, variants of these alarm calls are
   also given in response to caiman as well as during highly aggressive
   interactions between conspecifics and thus may not convey specific
   information about the type of predator or the threat to listeners.
   Capuchin monkey alarm calls may therefore have the potential to be
   functionally referential, general and/or urgency-based signals. Future
   research using detailed playback experiments with alarm calls and
   analyses of listeners' responses is required. (c) 2005 The Association

Volume = {37},

Pages = {32-43},

Abstract = {From January 2000 through December 2002, focal plant censuses were
   carried out to assess monthly leaf, flower, and ripe fruit presence for
   423 individual plants (96 plant species, 39 families) within the
   littoral forest of Sainte Luce, Madagascar. Fruit-on-trail counts were
   conducted additionally in 2000 to allow comparison between both
   phenological methods. Despite low climatic seasonality and the absence
   of a dry season in the littoral forest, interannual phenological
   patterns were seasonal. Within year variability was present with clear
   periods of abundance and scarcity. All phenophases were highly
   intercorrelated and peaked from November through February. This was
   found in other humid Malagasy forests as well, while in dry Malagasy
   forests phenophases were separated in time perhaps due to the more
   seasonal climate. Temperature and day length seemed to influence all
   phenophases, the latter showing the strongest effect, while rainfall was
   only weekly associated with flushing and flowering. Differences in the
   presence of ripe fruits when comparing between sampling methods can be
   explained by the differential contribution of several life forms.},

Abstract = {Ecogeographic size variations have been documented in some but not all
   sifakas. Few morphometric or body weight data have been available for
   two critically endangered subspecies of diademed sifakas: Perrier's
   sifakas (Propithecus diadema perrieri) and silky sifakas (Propithecus
   diadema candidus). The objectives of our study were to determine size
   variations in sifakas and if these variations are related to resource
   quality and/or resource seasonality. P. d. perrieri and P. d. candidus
   were captured, weighed, and measured in northern Madagascar. Body
   weights and morphometrics were compared with other subspecies of
   diademed sifakas and indris (Indri indri). Differences in body weights
   and morphometrics between taxa are particularly pronounced for P. d.
   perrieri compared to P. d. diadema, P. d. edwardsi, and L indri. Most
   morphometrics varied in comparisons between P. d. candidus and the other
   Indriidae (P. d. diadema, P. d. edwardsi, and L indri). Average body
   size in sifakas is positively correlated with annual rainfall and
   negatively correlated with length of dry season. Sifaka body size is not
   correlated with protein-to-fiber ratios. Thus, size variations in
   sifakas are related to resource seasonality rather than resource
   quality. The relationships between the temporal availability of food
   resources and sifaka. body size reflect complex and regionally varying
   causalities. Detailed, longitudinal information on the ecological
   factors underlying food selection and nutrient requirements in sifakas
   are needed to determine the relationship between ecogeographic variables
   and body size in sifakas. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   affected the thalamus almost exclusively. Upon correlating these MRI
   observations with a panel of different histologic staining techniques,
   it appeared that only plaques that were positive for both thioflavin-S

   plaques in the cortex that did not display iron staining remained
   invisible to MRI. The in vivo detection amyloid plaques in this mouse
   model, using the intrinsic MR contrast arising from the iron associated
   with the plaques creates an unexpected opportunity for the noninvasive

   to Madagascar and a further 21 are endemic to the Indian Ocean
   sub-region, consisting of Madagascar, the Comoros and the Mascarenes.
   The matrix habitats (Melaleuca forests, marecage swamp forest,
   Eucalyptus plantations and Erica grassland) that immediately surround
   the littoral forests were depauperate of bird species and contained few
   species that were found within the littoral forests. The geographic
   location of littoral forest remnants had an important role in
   determining what bird species occurred within them, with the northern
   remnants having similar bird communities to nearby humid forest whilst
   the most southern remnant had a bird community that resembled those of
   nearby spiny forest habitats. Eleven bird species that have been
   previously described as being habitat-restricted endemics to either
   spiny forests or humid forests, were found in littoral forest remnants.
   These results suggest that these littoral forests may play an important
   transitional role between the two other major natural habitats (spiny
   forest and humid forest) of southeastern Madagascar. On this basis we
   advocate that the littoral forest remnants of southeastern Madagascar
   should be afforded continuing conservation priority.},

Title = {How does the zoo environment affect the behaviour of captive primates?},

   Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA, AUG, 2002},
Abstract = {It is important for us to be able to understand the behaviour of
   primates in zoos for at least three reasons: firstly as a means towards
   ensuring their welfare. secondly to use that understanding to ensure a
   positive zoo experience for zoo visitors, and thirdly so that results of
   basic research undertaken on zoo primates can be properly evaluated.
   Often, however. the results of studies of how the zoo environment
   affects primate behaviour are not easy to interpret. We should recognize
   that the zoo environment is only one of a number of environments in
   which primates live. and should identify in which ways the zoo
   environment is different from those other environments. Here, it is
   suggested that the zoo environment may be defined in terms of three
   dimensions: regular presence of tame. numbers of unfamiliar humans,
   restricted space, and being managed. Individually all three of these can
   also be found in other. non-zoo environments, but all three together are
   characteristic of zoo environments. This paper is an initial attempt to
   compare studies of primate responses to the variables associated with
   each of these three dimensions across different primate environments. It
   is concluded that there is a need for at least two different types of
   study in future: comparisons across a range of primate environments
   using the same species and measures. and studies of the interactions
   between the three dimensions identified for zoo environments. (C) 2004

Abstract = {Reproductive success in male primates can be influenced by testosterone
   ( T) and cortisol ( C). We examined them in wild Saguinus mystax via
   fecal hormone analysis. Firstly, we wanted to characterize male hormonal
   status over the course of the year. Further we tested the influence of
   the reproductive status of the breeding female, social instability, and
   intergroup encounter rates on T levels, comparing the results with
   predictions of the challenge hypothesis (Wingfield et al., 1990). We
   also tested for interindividual differences in hormonal levels, possibly
   related to social or breeding status. We collected data during a 12-mo
   study on 2 groups of moustached tamarins at the Estacion Biologica
   Quebrada Blanco in northeastern Peru. We found fairly similar T and C
   levels over the course of the year for all males. Yet an elevation of T
   shortly after the birth of infants, during the phase of ovarian
   inactivity of the group's breeding female, was evident. Hormonal levels
   were not significantly elevated during a phase of social instability,
   did not correlate with intergroup encounter rates, and did not differ
   between breeding and nonbreeding males. Our results confirm the
   challenge hypothesis ( Wingfield et al., 1990). The data suggest that
   reproductive competition in moustached tamarins is not based on
   endocrinological, but instead on behavioral mechanisms, possibly
   combined with sperm competition.},

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},

Abstract = {Reconciliation is the post-conflict friendly reunion between opponents.
   A series of conditions and rules in order for reconciliation to take
   place has been recently proposed. One critical condition is that the
   relationship between opponents must be disrupted. We tested this
   condition using post-conflict and matched-control observations on 4
   small groups of tamarins ( Saguinus labiatus). Our previous lack of
   evidence for reconciliation was confirmed. No post-conflict relationship
   damage was therefore expected. We found evidence that relationships were
   disturbed following conflicts over food but, as in other primates, no
   evidence for reconciliation following such conflicts was found. For
   non-foodrelated conflicts there was no evidence that relationships were
   disturbed, as opponents were in close proximity to each other and
   resumed the exact same activity as frequently in the post-conflict
   observations as they did in the matched-control observations. We
   conclude that `everyday' aggression may not disrupt the relationships
   among individuals from the same family group and therefore
   reconciliation is not needed.},

   services by citizens between the ages of 18-24.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study uses model of e-government
   adoption to assess young voters' intention to use an online voting
   system. The study integrates constructs from technology acceptance,
   diffusion of innovation, and web trust models. A survey is administered
   to 208 young voters. The data is analyzed using multiple regression
   analysis.
   Findings - Results indicate that user perceptions of compatibility,
   usefulness, and trust significantly impact their intention to use an
   electronic-voting system. The model explains 76 percent of the variance
   in young voters' intention to use an e-voting system.
   Research limitations/implications - The study only explores the
   perceptions of one age group. Future studies could use the model to
   access adoption perceptions of a more diverse pool of citizens.
   Practical implications - Government agencies should emphasize the
   benefits of this electronic service to young voters. If marketed
   properly, the convenience and compatibility of e-voting may be
   influential enough to motivate this normally apathetic demographic to
   participate in the election process.
   Originality/value - This study explores adoption of internet voting by
   young citizens. An understanding of the factors that influence this
   demographics' intention to use e-voting systems can be used to increase
   voter participation. The findings of this study also lay the foundation
   for future studies on e-voting adoption.},

Abstract = {Madagascar's lowland littoral forests are rich in endemic taxa and
   considered to be seriously threatened by deforestation and habitat
   fragmentation. In this study I examined how littoral forest bird
   communities have been affected by fragmentation at the landscape scale.
   Bird species composition within 30 littoral forest remnants of differing
   size and isolation was determined using point counts conducted in
   October - December in 2001 and 2002. Each remnant was characterised by
   measures of remnant area, remnant shape, and isolation. Step-wise
   regression, nestedness analysis, and binomial logistic regression
   modelling was used to test the relationship between bird species and
   landscape variables. Bird species richness in remnants was significantly
   (p < 0.01) explained by remnant area but not by any measure of isolation
   or landscape complexity. The bird communities in the littoral forests
   were significantly (p < 0.01) nested. The majority of forest-dependent
   species had significant (p < 0.01) relationships with remnant area. As
   deforestation and fragmentation are still significant issues in
   Madagascar, I recommend that large (> 200 ha) blocks of littoral forest
   are awarded protected status to preserve what remains of their unique
   bird community.},

Abstract = {Interactions among fleshy fruits and frugivore assemblages are presented
   from a 1-y study in the littoral forest of Sainte Luce, south-eastern
   Madagascar. This community-level approach allowed us to determine food
   selection by all consumer species and to evaluate the role different
   frugivores play in seed dispersal and predation. For this, interactions
   between 13 6 consumed fruit species and 13 frugivorous species were
   studied. Fruit and seed size were the most important physical factors
   determining food selection of all consumer species. Nutritionally birds
   favoured and mammals avoided lipid-rich fruits. For Cheirogaleus spp.,
   that go into torpor, there was a trend to select sugar-rich fruit pulp.
   However, for numerous fruit traits the consumer species had no clear
   feeding preferences and they seemed to be quite flexible, eating
   whatever was available. This might be related to unpredictable fruit
   availability and low fruit productivity in the littoral forest, which
   may also partially explain the low number of frugivores present.
   Nevertheless frugivores have different impacts on seed dispersal.
   Eulemur fulvus collaris is particularly important for the dispersal of
   large-seeded species, while frugivorous birds and flying foxes ensure
   plant regeneration between and outside forest fragments. In terms of
   conservation, heterogeneous seed transport is particularly important for
   this severely degraded littoral forest.},

Abstract = {All animals including primates show regular variations in their
   behavioural activities and physiological functions. In numerous species
   diel, ultradian, infradian, annual and/or lunar rhythms have been
   established; however, the use of the focal sampling method does not
   provide information on hour-to-hour nor day-to-day variations. In
   behavioural field studies dealing with primate activity rhythms and
   their modulation by environmental variables the possible dual,
   synchronizing and/or masking effect of these variables is often ignored.
   In the present study, we analyze the relation between astronomical and
   meteorological parameters and various parameters of the rest-activity
   rhythm in Ateles geoffroyi, a species scarcely investigated with respect
   to biological rhythms. These Ateles were kept under semi-natural
   conditions, exposed to natural light, temperature and humidity cycles,
   and sky state. Motor activity was recorded with actiwatch accelerometers
   during 180 days (5-min intervals), starting from the autumn equinox.
   Results: Ateles is active throughout the day, rests during the night and
   presents bimodal activity. Activity time, onset and end of activity as
   well as the times of their two activity peaks were significantly
   correlated with duration of the solar day and sunrise or sunset time.
   The behavioural parameters also correlated with ambient temperature.
   Climate factors and sky-state significantly influenced the duration and
   times of onset and end of activity. Our findings identified a clear
   modulation of the rest activity pattern by astronomical variables
   serving as Zeitgebers, such as the natural light-dark cycle, and by
   masking effects of meteorological factors (temperature, weather and
   cloudiness), as well as of artificial variables introduced by the
   interaction with man. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Measuring energy expenditure in cardiac patients using the Body Media
   (TM) Armband versus indirect calorimetry - A validation study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE AND PHYSICAL FITNESS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {44},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Aim. The purpose of this study was to compare differences in energy
   expenditure using the newly developed SenseWear(TM) Armband body monitor
   to indirect calorimetry in cardiac rehabilitation patients.
   Methods. Twenty-four (62+/-8.1 years) patients completed steady state
   exercise for 8 minutes on 4 modes of exercise (arm ergometry, treadmill
   walking, recumbent stepping and rowing ergometry). Total cumulative
   kilojoules were recorded simultaneously by indirect calorimetry and the
   SenseWear(TM) Armband. Statistical analyses assessed the degree of
   agreement between the 2 measurement methods and 3 different versions of
   the SenseWear software.
   Results. The correlations between indirect calorimetry and version 2.2
   of the SenseWear armband for arm and rowing ergometry, the treadmill and
   recumbent stepper were r=0.90, r=0.67, r=0.80 and r=0.74, respectively.
   There were no between method differences during arm ergometry (p<1.000)
   and the recumbent stepper (p<0.102). Bland and Altman plots revealed the
   greatest spread of scores for the rower and the treadmill. Between
   method differences were minimal when using the preliminary cardiac
   software. The correlations for arm and rowing ergometry, the treadmill
   and recumbent stepper were r=0.90, r=0.84, r=0.78 and r=0.82,
   respectively.
   Conclusion. The accuracy of the BodyMedia(TM) SenseWear Armband appears
   to be exercise modality dependent in those with heart disease when using
   software developed for the general population. Therefore, the
   information should be interpreted cautiously, particularly during
   treadmill walking and rowing. Initial experiments with cardiac-focused
   software are promising, but preliminary.},

Title = {Illumination of cryptic species boundaries in long-tailed shrew tenrecs
   (Mammalia : Tenrecidae ; Microgale), with new insights into geographic
   variation and distributional constraints},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY},
Year = {2004},

Abstract = {The increasing use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to explore and test
   species limits among morphologically similar species is potentially
   compromised by phenomena poorly reflective of organismal history and
   speciation, including (but not limited to) stochastic lineage sorting
   and gene flow. In situations where molecular data are only available
   from a single gene or linkage partition (e.g. mtDNA), corroboration of
   suspected species boundaries should be sought from independent lines of
   evidence, such as morphology. Recent attempts to delimit species using
   mtDNA and morphology have either implicitly or explicitly ignored the
   possibility that distinct species can occur in direct sympatry
   throughout much of their range, presumably because such situations are
   believed to be rare. We examined phylogenetic relationships within the
   long-tailed shrew tenrecs (Mammalia: Tenrecidae; Microgale spp.) from
   Madagascar. Current taxonomy recognizes two broadly sympatric species,
   though as many as six have been described. Given that alpha taxonomy
   within shrew tenrecs has been controversial, and that patterns of
   morphological variation can be especially difficult to assess for this
   group, some authors have suggested that additional cryptic species may
   exist. To examine this possibility, we conducted a phylogenetic study
   using the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene and a
   morphometric analysis of 29 craniodental, postcranial, and external
   measurements from a broad geographical sample of long-tailed shrew
   tenrecs. The two data sets were nearly perfectly congruent in
   identifying four groups that can be classified as species, thereby
   doubling the currently recognized number of species. We present
   previously unrecognized distributional evidence consistent with our
   conclusions and provide an empirical example of how a revised
   understanding of species limits alters inferences of geographic
   variation and species coexistence, particularly with respect to
   fine-scale habitat partitioning. The results of this study suggest that
   certain species pairs, previously assumed to be single species occupying
   broad elevational ranges, are actually reproductively isolated units
   that are partitioning their environment along elevational lines. (C)

   Principles and experimental validation},
Journal = {RADIO SCIENCE},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Array processing usually operates on identical sensors. In this paper an
   investigation is made to apply the direction finding algorithm MUSIC to
   an antenna array with nonidentical elements (heterogeneous array). This
   original solution is polarization-sensitive though it resorts to only
   one sensor at each point of the spatial sampling. As a major consequence
   of its structure, the computation of the MUSIC algorithm is based on an
   expression of the steering vector that integrates the spatial response
   of each sensor. This concept is then validated in the special context of
   HF radio direction finding, for which a deterministic model of the
   polarization at the exit of the ionospheric channel is derived. A
   multichannel radio receiving system has been developed and experimented
   using transmitters located more than 1000 km from the receiving site.},

Abstract = {The slender loris (Loris lydekkerianus lydekkerianus), a nocturnal
   prosimian, was studied for 21 months in its natural habitat of scrub
   jungle in Dindigul, south India. Here we report on its reproductive
   biology. Identified and unidentified lorises were observed for a total
   of 2,656 h. Reproductive seasonality was seen, with births and oestrus
   observed to be highest in April-June and October-December. The mating
   system was promiscuous with 1 female mating successively with 3-4 males.
   A gestation of 5.5 months and an inter-birth interval of 7 months were
   recorded. Adult females had a reproductive potential of 4 infants per
   year. The findings presented in this paper constitute the first
   information on the life history parameters of wild slender lorises.

Title = {Dietary and feeding differences between sympatric Propithecus diadema
   diadema and Indri indri},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {We analyzed the dietary profiles and feeding behaviors of Propithecus
   diadema diadema and Indri indri in a community of animals that reside in
   midaltitude rain forest within Madagascar's Mantadia National Park.
   Propithecus diadema diadema ate a diverse mixture of fruits, seeds,
   flowers and young leaves, while the bulk of the diet of Indri indri
   consisted of young leaves, which resulted in significantly higher levels
   of fat and water-soluble carbohydrates in foods eaten by Propithecus
   diadema diadema. Fiber values of items eaten are high ( 54\% NDF) for
   both species, though not significantly different between them. The
   preference for immature foliage by Indri indri suggests that their
   overall intake of fiber is greater than that of Propithecus diadema
   diadema, which had a high proportion of non-leaf material in their diet.
   We propose that differences in gut morphology between the two indriids
   contribute to their disparate diets. Levels of secondary compounds were
   high in certain food items, but overall they are also not significantly
   different between the two indriid diets. Propithecus diadema diadema
   exhibited a strong preference for 2 alkaloid-containing seed species,
   while no food of Indri indri contained alkaloids. In addition,

Abstract = {We compared the diets of 3 groups of released captive-bred Varecia
   variegata variegata (RG1, RG2, RG3) in the Betampona Reserve to that
   recorded for a resident wild group, between 1998 and 2001. We
   investigated whether the released captive-bred Varecia, from differing
   captive backgrounds, could cope with seasonal changes in climate and
   consequently food availability, finding sufficient food to meet their
   nutritional requirements, and dietary choices and selection. We
   collected data on diet, including plant part, family, genus and, if
   known, species. In addition, we collected data on seasonal variation in
   dietary composition. Dietary overlap is significant at the familial
   level between RG1/RG3 and the wild group. There is some dietary overlap
   between RG2 and the wild group, but it is not significant. In general,
   RG1 and RG3 more closely followed the dietary choices and seasonal
   changes in diet exhibited by the wild group. We conclude that Varecia
   raised in free-ranging environments are better adapted to meet their
   nutritional requirements in the wild than those raised in cages are.
   However, even they struggle to deal with seasonal climatic changes and
   consequent changes in food availability. We suggest that future
   re-introduction efforts for primates include attempts to integrate
   released individuals rapidly into wild groups so that they can learn to
   cope with a seasonal environment through direct observation of wild
   conspecifics.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To examine the effects of exercise training on paediatric
   obesity immediately after training and at a one year follow up and to
   provide recommendations for future research.
   Methods: Studies that met the following criteria were included in a
   meta-analysis: (a) at least six subjects per group; (b) subject groups
   consisting of children in the 4-17 year age range; (c) pre-test and
   post-test values for body composition; (d) used exercise such as
   walking, jogging, cycle ergometry, high repetition resistance exercise,
   and combinations; (e) training programmes lasting eight weeks or more;
   (f) full length publications; (g) apparently healthy children.
   Results: A total of 135 studies of exercise as a method of treatment of
   paediatric obesity were located. Eight, containing 236 subjects, met our
   criteria for inclusion. Across all designs and categories, fixed effects
   modelling yielded significant decreases in the dependent variable
   percentage body fat immediately (0 = 1.04 (0.35); 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) 0.41 to 1.6) and one year after the exercise intervention
   (0 = 0.84 (0.51); 95\% CI 0.22 to 0.94). Forward stepwise linear
   regression suggested that the percentage body fat measured at the end of
   exercise training, exercise duration, and programme length accounted for
   53-86\% of the variance for percentage body fat at one year.
   Conclusions: These data indicate that exercise is efficacious for
   reducing percentage body fat in obese children and adolescents, and that
   exercise intervention may encourage long term maintenance of the
   observed gains.},

Abstract = {The internal organization of myofibers and connective tissues has
   important physiologic implications for muscle function and for
   naturalistic behavior. In this study of forelimb muscle morphology and
   primate locomotion, fiber architecture is examined in the intrinsic
   muscles of the shoulder (musculi deltoideus, infraspinatus,
   supraspinatus, subscapularis, teres major, and t. minor) and arm (in.
   coracobrachialis, biceps brachii, brachialis, and triceps brachii) in
   the semiterrestrial vervets (Chlorocebus aethiops) and arboreal
   red-tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius). Wet weights and lengths of
   whole muscles, lengths of fasciculi and their associated proximal and
   distal tendons, and angles of pinnation were measured to estimate
   morphologic correlates of physiologic properties of individual muscles:
   force, velocity/excursion, energy expense, and relative isometric or
   isotonic contraction. Neither mean total-shoulder:total-arm ratios for
   muscle mass nor total reduced physiological cross-sectional area
   exhibited significant (P < 0.05) interspecific differences, thus
   emphasizing the importance of fine-tuning musculoskeletal analyses by
   the data collected here. The results generally support those previously
   published for quadriceps femoris and triceps surae of the hind limb in
   these species (Anapol and Barry {[}1996] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol.
   99:429-447). The fiber architecture of the semiterrestrial vervets is
   largely suited for higher velocity while running on the ground. By
   contrast, the architectural configuration of red-tailed monkeys implies
   relatively isometric muscle contraction and passive storage of elastic
   strain energy for exploitation of the compliant canopy, where substrate
   components are situated beneath the sagittal plane of the animal. With
   respect to relative distribution of maximum potential force output among
   muscles of either shoulder or arm groups in these otherwise hind
   limb-dominated quadrupedal primates, statistically significant
   interspecific differences are best interpreted in light of braking,
   climbing, and, for vervets, the transition between ground and canopy.
   The interspecific differences shown here for the intrinsic muscles of
   the shoulder and arm underscore the significance of intramuscular
   morphology in reconciling structure and function with regard to
   locomotor behavior. Its analysis and interpretation lend support to
   consideration of ``semiterrestrial{''} as a bona fide locomotor category
   uniquely different from what is practiced by dedicated arboreal and
   terrestrial quadrupeds that occasionally visit the habitat of one
   another. Data from a more committed terrestrial species would clarify
   this enigma. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The study of activity rhythms, their potential zeitgebers and masking
   factors among free-ranging primates has received relatively little
   attention in the past. Most primates are diurnal, a few of them
   nocturnal, and even fewer are cathemeral. Owl monkeys (Aotus azarai
   azarai) regularly show diurnal, as well as nocturnal, activity in the
   Argentinean and Paraguayan Chaco. The goal of this study was to examine
   how changes in activity patterns in owl monkeys of Formosa, Argentina
   are related to daily, monthly, and seasonal changes in temperature,
   light and food availability . During 1 year, I collected activity data
   from five groups followed continuously from dawn to dusk, dusk to dawn
   or uninterruptedly during 24 or 36 h for approximately 1,500 h. I kept
   hourly and daily records of temperature and light conditions, and I
   gathered monthly information on the density, distribution and abundance
   of food resources available to the monkeys. I found that the area of
   study is highly seasonal, and characterized by significant fluctuations
   in rainfall, temperature, photoperiod, and food availability. Owl
   monkeys had on average 5 h of activity during the day and 4 h during the
   night. The amount of diurnal activity remained fairly constant through
   the year despite seasonal changes in exogenous factors. Owl monkeys did
   not show changes in their activity patterns that could be attributed to
   changes in food availability. Nocturnal activity increased as the amount
   of moonlight increased, whereas diurnal activity decreased following a
   full-moon night. Ambient temperature was a good predictor of activity
   only when the moon was full. These results argue convincingly for an
   interaction between ambient temperature and moonlight in determining the
   observed activity pattern. It is then highly advisable that any
   evaluation of diurnal activity in cathemeral animals be analyzed
   controlling for the possible effects of moonlight during the previous
   night.},

Abstract = {Ecological explanations have been put forward to account for the
   precocious or delayed development of patency in ducts leading to the
   vomeronasal organ (VNO) in certain mammals. Perinatal function may be
   related, in part, to the patency or fusion of the vomeronasal and
   nasopalatine (NPD) ducts. However, few studies have focused on NPD
   development in primates, which generally have a prolonged period of
   dependence during infancy. In this study we examined 24 prenatal
   primates and 13 neonatal primates, and a comparative sample of fetal
   mice and insectivores. In embryonic and early fetal Microcebus murinus,
   the NPD was completely fused, whereas in fetuses of later stages the
   duct was partially fused or completely patent. M. myoxinus of all stages
   demonstrated some degree of NPD fusion. In all other prenatal primates,
   the NPD was fused to some extent. Four prenatal insectivores (Tenrec
   ecaudatus) showed some degree of NPD fusion. In Mus musculus at 19 days
   gestation, the NPD was patent, although the anatomically separate VNO
   duct was fused. T ecaudatus and most of the neonatal primates revealed
   complete NPD patency. An exception was Saguinus geoffroyi, which
   exhibited fusion of the NPD near the VNO opening. These observations may
   relate to differences in perinatal VNO function. The differences noted
   in our study suggest that M. murinus and M. myoxinus may differ in
   perinatal VNO functionality and perhaps in related behavior.
   Observations of neonatal primates suggest that NPD patency may be
   relatively common at birth and could serve other purposes in addition to
   being an access route for VNO stimuli. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {It has been suggested that the variability of the primate vomeronasal
   organ (VNO) may be greater than previously thought, especially among New
   World monkeys. It is not clear to what extent VNO variation reflects
   ontogenetic, functional, or phylogenetic differences among primates. The
   present study investigated VNO anatomy in an ontogenetic series of two
   genera of callitrichid primates, in order to assess recent attempts to
   develop VNO character states and to examine the evidence for VNO
   functionality at different life stages. A sample of six Leontopithecus
   rosalia, one L. chrysomelas, and six Saguinus geoffroyi was serially
   sectioned and stained using various methods. Two adult Callithrix
   jacchus were also sectioned for comparative purposes. The VNO of each
   primate was examined by light microscopy along its entire rostrocaudal
   extent. VNOs of the tamarins were described to determine whether they
   fit into 1 of 3 character states recently attributed to various New
   World monkeys. At birth, the two species of tamarins differed in the
   nature of communication between the VNO and nasopalatine duct (NPD). Two
   of 3 neonatal S. geoffroyi exhibited a fused VNO duct in a more dorsal
   position (adjacent to the nasal cavity) compared to that of L. rosalia.
   The VNO duct communicated with the NPD and was patent in neonatal L.
   rosalia. Both species appeared to have an age-related increase in the
   amount of sensory epithelium in the VNO. Subadult L. rosalia had caudal
   regions of the VNO that were exceptionally well-developed, similar to
   those of strepsirhine primates. Compared to subadults, all adult
   callitrichids appeared to have more ventral communications of the VNO
   duct directly into the NPD. Adult S. geoffroyi and L. chrysomelas both
   had VNO sensory epithelium separated by multiple patches of nonsensory
   epithelium. This contrasted with the VNOs of C. jacchus, which had a
   nearly continuous distribution of receptors on all surfaces of the VNO.
   The findings indicate that tamarins have delayed maturation of the VNO
   epithelium, and that some species have little or no perinatal function.
   These results also suggest that ontogenetic changes in craniofacial form
   may alter the position of the VNO in tamarins. The present study
   supports the use of at least two character states to categorize the VNO
   of various callitrichids, but it is suggested that one of these,
   previously called ``reduced sensory epithelium{''} should be instead
   termed ``interrupted sensory epithelium.{''} The distribution of VNO
   sensory epithelium does not appear to reflect phylogenetic influences;
   it is more likely a functional characteristic that varies throughout
   postnatal life. Therefore, this chemosensory system has a high degree of
   plasticity relating to age and function, which in some instances can
   confound the use of characteristics as phylogenetic traits. Further
   study is needed to quantify VNO receptors in various species to
   determine if functional differences exist and if some species have more
   precocious VNO function than others. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {An understanding of the evolution of human bipedalism can provide
   valuable insights into the biomechanical and physiological
   characteristics of locomotion in modern humans. The walking gaits of
   humans, other bipeds; and most quadrupedal mammals can best be described
   by using an inverted-pendulum model, in which there is minimal change in
   flexion of the limb joints during stance phase. As a result, it seems
   logical that the evolution of bipedalism in humans involved a simple
   transition from a relatively stiff-legged quadrupedalism in a
   terrestrial ancestor to relatively stiff-legged bipedalism in early
   humans. However, experimental studies of locomotion in humans and
   nonhuman primates have shown that the evolution of bipedalism involved a
   much more complex series of transitions, originating with a relatively
   compliant form of quadrupedalism. These studies show that relatively
   compliant walking gaits allow primates to achieve fast walking speeds
   using long strides, low stride frequencies, relatively low peak vertical
   forces, and relatively high impact shock attenuation ratios. A
   relatively compliant, ape-like bipedal walking style is consistent with
   the anatomy of early hominids and may have been an effective gait for a
   small biped with relatively small and less stabilized joints, which had
   not yet completely forsaken arboreal locomotion. Laboratory-based
   studies of primates also suggest that human bipedalism arose not from a
   terrestrial ancestor but rather from a climbing, arboreal forerunner.
   Experimental data, in conjunction with anatomical data on early human
   ancestors, show clearly that a relatively stiff modern human gait and
   associated physiological and anatomical adaptations are not primitive
   retentions from a primate ancestor, but are instead recently acquired
   characters of our genus.},

Abstract = {Using a conditioning paradigm, the olfactory sensitivity of three
   squirrel monkeys and three pigtail macaques for a homologous series of
   aliphatic aldehydes (n-butanal to n-nonanal) was assessed. With only few
   exceptions, the animals of both species significantly discriminated
   concentrations below 1 ppm from the odorless solvent, and with n-butanal
   and n-hexanal individual pigtail macaques even demonstrated thresholds
   below 1 ppb. The results showed (1) both primate species to have a
   well-developed olfactory sensitivity for aliphatic aldehydes, (2)
   pigtail macaques to generally perform better than squirrel monkeys in
   detecting members of this class of odorants, and (3) no significant
   correlation between perceptibility in terms of olfactory detection
   thresholds and carbon chain length of the aliphatic aldehydes in both
   species tested. These findings lend further support to the growing body
   of evidence suggesting that between-species comparisons of the number of
   functional olfactory receptor genes or of neuroanatomical features are
   poor predictors of olfactory performance. Further, our findings suggest
   that olfaction may play an important and hitherto underestimated role in
   the regulation of behavior in the species tested.},

Abstract = {Many chameleon species are thought to be restricted to primary
   rainforest where they are threatened by the continued fragmentation. and
   degradation of natural vegetation. We surveyed chameleon abundance in
   forest subject to high disturbance, low disturbance and in a riparian
   zone in Madagascar. Four Calumma species and Brookesia thieli were
   present in all habitats, but B. minima was not recorded from the
   high-disturbance forest. Chameleons were,more abundant in rainforest
   subject to low-disturbance (e.g. selective timber extraction) than in
   patches of high-disturbance forest that was recovering front burning.
   Riparian zones within low-disturbance forest provided linear patches of
   high chameleon, abundance and are therefore an important con servation
   resource because they also protect a range of other endemic and
   threatened species. Carefully designed management plans are needed to
   conserve biodiversity and allow the sustainable use of forest products
   by people in Madagascar. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {Molecular genetic approaches to the study of primate behavior, social

Booktitle = {YEARBOOK OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY: VOL 46},

Abstract = {In the past several decades, the development of novel molecular
   techniques and the advent of noninvasive DNA sampling, coupled with the
   ease and speed with which molecular analyses can now be performed, have
   made it possible for primatologists to directly examine the fitness
   effects of individual behavior and to explore how variation in behavior
   and social systems influences primate population genetic structure. This
   review describes the theoretical connections between individual behavior
   and primate social systems on the one hand and population genetic
   structure on the other, discusses the kinds of molecular markers
   typically employed in genetic studies of primates, and summarizes what
   primatologists have learned from molecular studies over the past few
   decades about dispersal patterns, mating systems, reproductive
   strategies, and the influence of kinship on social behavior. Several
   important conclusions can be drawn from this overview. First, genetic
   data confirm that, in many species, male dominance rank and fitness are
   positively related, at least over the short term, though this
   relationship need not simply be a reflection of male-male contest
   competition over mates. More importantly, genetic research reveals the
   significance of female choice in determining male reproductive success,
   and documents the efficacy of alternative mating tactics among males.
   Second, genetic data suggest that the presumed importance of kinship in
   structuring primate social relationships needs to be evaluated further,
   at least for some taxa such as chimpanzees in which demographic factors
   may be more important than relatedness. I conclude this paper by
   offering several suggestions of additional ways in which molecular
   techniques might be employed in behavioral and ecological studies of
   primates (e.g., for conducting,{''}molecular censuses{''} of
   unhabituated populations, for studying disease and host-parasite
   interactions, or for tracking seed fate in studies of seed dispersal)
   and by providing a brief introduction to the burgeoning field of
   nonhuman primate behavioral genetics. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Journal = {MAMMALIA},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {67},

Abstract = {We tested whether the socio-spatial distribution of mound-building mice,
   Mus spicilegus, could be compatible with a monogamous mating system as
   suggested by several behavioural laboratory studies. A five day trapping
   session took place in an agricultural field in the Gyongyos region
   (Hungary) at the end of April 2000. The species was identified through
   genetic techniques based on the microsatellite locus Musmcka. In total
   43 animals were captured, and recapture rate was high (6/10 for males,
   17/33 for females). Out of the 33 captured females, 17 were pregnant.
   Animals were generally recaptured in the same trap. Spatial associations
   (animals captured in the same trap) were observed between a male and a
   female (six cases) but also between females (six pairs and two trios)
   with or without a male. Based on these results we questioned the
   occurrence of monogamy and we proposed that polygyny could occur at
   least during the beginning of the reproductive season and in this
   studied population. Female biased sex-ratio and high population density
   may have favoured polygyny. However, associations between females could
   have resulted from the development of strong social bounds during the
   six months spent together during winter inside the mound. A possible
   consequence is that polygyny might be restricted to the over-wintering
   generation.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an operational system of digital transmission within
   the H.F. frequency range, aiming at a significant increase of the data
   transfer rate compared with the current standard (4800 bit/s).
   Therefore, an array processing algorithm performs with a set of
   collocated sensors, the spatial responses of which are different one
   from each other The dependence of the incoming polarization relatively
   to the direction of arrival induces a significant decorrelation of the
   received signals though no geometrical phase exists. Signal processing
   techniques run at the output of the spatial filter resorting for the
   synchronisation and the filtering (LMS algorithm) to classical and
   well-tested techniques involving training sequences. An experimental
   radio link with a 250 km range has been set up to test the sensibility
   of the performances in reception regarding the choice of waveforms. The
   operational results reach the expected goal as the data transfer rate
   increases up to 20 kbit/s in a bandwidth of 6 kHz.},

Abstract = {Pair-bonding may be a significant feature of the social repertoire of
   some primate species. However, discerning inter- and intraspecific pair
   bonds is problematic. I present an overview of the general behavior and
   ecology of species reported to occur in two-adult, pair-bonded groups.
   There is no two-adult grouped nonhuman primate species in Africa and
   only two types in Asia. Behavioral and ecological data suggest that the
   two-adult group or pair-bonding or both may have evolved separately 4-7
   times. I propose that two pair-bond components-social pair bond and
   sexual pair bond-occur and can be defined and described in such a manner
   that facilitates comparative analysis across primate taxa. The evolution
   of grouping patterns in many two-adult grouped primates may be best
   modeled via evolutionary scenarios relying on direct dietary/energetic
   constraints, predation, and possibly mate-guarding. There is little
   support for the infanticide prevention and bodyguard hypotheses of
   female-choice models.},

Abstract = {We review evolutionary processes and mechanisms that gave rise to the
   diversity of primate social systems. We define social organization,
   social structure and mating system as distinct components of a social
   system. For each component, we summarize levels and patterns of
   variation among primates and discuss evolutionary determinants of this
   variation. We conclude that conclusive explanations for a solitary life
   and pair-living are still lacking. We then focus on interactions among
   the 3 components in order to identify main targets of selection and
   potential constraints for social evolution. Social organization and
   mating system are more closely linked to each other than either one is
   to social structure. Further, we conclude that it is important to seek a
   priori measures for the effects of presumed selective factors and that
   the genetic contribution to social systems is still poorly examined.
   Finally, we examine the role of primate socio-ecology in current
   evolutionary biology and conclude that primates are not prominently
   represented because the main questions asked in behavioral ecology are
   often irrelevant for primate behavior. For the future, we see a
   rapprochement of these areas as the role of disease and life-history
   theory are integrated more fully into primate socio-ecology.},

Abstract = {Response-contingent reinforcement was expected to increase the time
   spent riding a stationary exercise cycle by college women. A
   single-subject experimental design was used. Three college-age women
   rode a stationary cycle until they were either too tired to continue or
   until 45 minutes elapsed. Video clips were used to reinforce cycling in
   the first part of the experiment. Under some conditions, no video clips
   were presented (baseline). In other conditions, the video was on for the
   entire session or 25 sec. of video was presented after the completion of
   FR 40 (40 rotations of the cycle's pedals) or 80 (80 rotations of the
   cycle's pedals) schedules. In the second part of the experiment, money
   was presented following every 20 (FR 20) or 40 (FR 40) rotations of the
   cycle's pedals. The time spent riding the cycle increased over the
   baseline when video clips were presented. No consistent differences were
   observed when tine video clips were on for the entire session and when
   they were presented under FR 40 and FR 80 schedules. For one out of two
   participants, monetary reward increased the time spent riding the cycle.
   The data suggest that reinforcement schedules are a means of initiating
   and maintaining adherence to an exercise program.},

Abstract = {The diet of striped possums Dactylopsila trivirgata inhabiting the
   tropical forests of far north Queensland, Australia, was investigated by
   observing foraging behaviour and analysing stomach samples collected
   opportunistically from dead animals. In contrast to non-dactylopsiline
   petaurids, which frequently use plant exudates as well as invertebrates,
   observations on the foraging behaviour of D. trivirgata indicate that it
   is an opportunistic forager feeding mainly on invertebrates. Animals
   occasionally fed on plant exudates but these contributed little to the
   diet. Nine different orders of invertebrates were present in stomach
   samples, with wood boring coleopteran and lepidopteran larvae, and adult
   hymenopterans and isopterans being most frequently represented in the
   diet. This is consistent with the unusual morphological characteristics
   of D. trivirgata's, such as their elongated fourth finger and powerful
   jaws, which appear to be adaptations for extracting prey such as
   wood-boring larvae. Two of the important prey taxa in the diet (alates
   of Formicidae, and larvae of Cerambycidae) had a very high fat content
   (44\% and 40\%, of dry weight, respectively) suggesting that the animals
   may target prey of high nutritional value. Anatomical investigations
   indicated that, relative to body weight, the digestive tract of D.
   trivirgata was shorter than that of most other petaurids. These data
   further support the idea that D. trivirgata is more reliant on
   invertebrates than other members of the family Petauridae.},

Title = {Functional aspects of strepsirrhine lumbar vertebral bodies and spinous
   processes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {42},
Number = {6},
Pages = {753-783},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The relationship between form and function in the lumbar vertebral
   column has been well documented among platyrrhines and especially
   catarrhines, while functional studies of postcranial morphology among
   strepsirrhines have concentrated predominantly on the limbs. This
   morphometric study investigates biomechanically relevant attributes of
   the lumbar vertebral morphology of 20 species of extant strepsirrhines.
   With this extensive sample, our goal is to address the influence of
   positional behavior on lumbar vertebral form while also assessing the
   effects of body size and phylogenetic history. The results reveal
   distinctions in lumbar vertebral morphology among strepsirrhines in
   functional association with their habitual postures and primary
   locomotor behaviors. In general, strepsirrhines that emphasize
   pronograde posture and quadrupedal locomotion combined with leaping
   (from a pronograde position) have the relatively longest lumbar regions
   and lumbar vertebral bodies, features promoting sagittal spinal
   flexibility. Indrids and galagonids that rely primarily on vertical
   clinging and leaping with orthograde posture share a relatively short
   (i.e., stable and resistant to bending), lumbar region, although the
   length of individual lumbar vertebral bodies varies phylogenetically and
   possibly allometrically. The other two vertical clingers and leapers,
   Hapalemur and Lepilemur, more closely resemble the pronograde,
   quadrupedal taxa. The specialized, suspensory lorids have relatively
   short lumbar regions as well, but the lengths of their lumbar regions
   are influenced by body size, and Arctocebus has dramatically longer
   vertebral bodies than do the other lorids. Lumbar morphology among
   galagonids appears to reflect a strong phylogenetic signal superimposed
   on a functional one. In general, relative length of the spinous
   processes follows a positively allometric trend, although lorids
   (especially the larger-bodied forms) have relatively short spinous
   processes for their body size, in accordance with their positional
   repertoire. The results of the study broaden our understanding of
   postcranial adaptation in primates, while providing an extensive
   comparative database for interpreting vertebral morphology in fossil
   primates. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {267},

Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The vomeronasal organ (VNO) is a chemosensory structure that has
   morphological indications of functionality in strepsirhine and New World
   primates examined to date. In these species, it is thought to mediate
   certain socio-sexual behaviors. The functionality and even existence of
   the VNO in Old World primates has been debated. Most modern texts state
   that the VNO is absent in Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. A recent
   study on the VNO in the chimpanzee (Smith et al., 2001b) challenged this
   notion, demonstrating the need for further comparative studies of
   primates. In particular, there is a need to establish how the
   human/chimpanzee VNO differs from that of other primates and even
   nonhomologous mucosal ducts. Histochemical and microscopic morphological
   characteristics of the VNO and nasopalatine duct (NPD) were examined in
   51 peri- and postnatal primates, including humans, chimpanzees, five
   species of New World monkeys, and seven strepsirhine species. The nasal
   septum was removed from each primate and histologically processed for
   coronal sectioning. Selected anteroposterior intervals of the VNO were
   variously stained with alcian blue (AB)-periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), PAS
   only, Gomori trichrome, or hematoxylin-eosin procedures. All
   strepsirhine species had well developed VNOs, with a prominent
   neuroepithelium and vomeronasal cartilages that nearly surrounded the
   VNO. New World monkeys had variable amounts of neuroepithelia, whereas
   Pan troglodytes and Homo sapiens had no recognizable neuroepithelium or
   vomeronasal nerves (VNNs). Certain unidentified cell types of the
   human/chimpanzee VNO require further examination (immunohistochemical
   and electron microscopic). The VNOs of P. troglodytes, H. sapiens, and
   New World monkeys exhibited different histochemistry of mucins compared
   to strepsirhine species. The nasopalatine region showed great variation
   among species. It is a blind-ended pit in P. troglodytes, a glandular
   recess in H. sapiens, a mucous-producing duct in Otolemur
   crassicaudatus, and a stratified squamous passageway in all other
   species. This study also revealed remarkable morphological/histochemical
   variability in the VNO and nasopalatine regions among the primate
   species examined. The VNOs of humans and chimpanzees had some structural
   similarities to nonhomologous ciliated gland ducts seen in other
   primates. However, certain distinctions from the VNOs of other primates
   or nonhomologous epithelial structures characterize the human/chimpanzee
   VNO: 1) bilateral epithelial tubes; 2) a superiorly displaced position
   in the same plane as the paraseptal cartilages; 3) a homogeneous,
   pseudostratified columnar morphology with ciliated regions; and 4)
   mucous-producing structures in the epithelium itself.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effects of frequency of
   verbal encouragement during maximal exercise testing. Twenty-eight
   participants (12 males, 16 females) aged 20.9 +/- 1.5 years (mean +/- s)
   performed a maximal exercise test ((V) over dot O-2max) on a treadmill
   without any verbal encouragement. The participants were matched
   according to their pre-test (V) over dot O-2max and placed into either a
   control group or one of three experimental groups. They performed a
   second exercise test (post-test) 1 week later. During the second test,
   the control group received no verbal encouragement; the 20 s (20E), 60 s
   (60E) and 180 s (180E) encouragement groups received verbal
   encouragement every 20, 60 and 180 s, respectively, beginning with stage
   3 of the exercise test. Relative (V) over dot O-2max, exercise time,
   blood lactate concentration, respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and
   ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were not significantly different
   from the first test to the second test for the control group without
   verbal encouragement and the 180E group that received infrequent
   encouragement. Post-test values were significantly higher than pre-test
   values for the 20E and 60E groups. The post-test values of the 20E group
   were significantly higher than their pre-test values for relative (V)
   over dot O-2max (P < 0.001), exercise time (P < 0.0001), blood lactate
   concentration (P < 0.05), RER (P < 0.01) and RPE (P < 0.0001); this was
   also the case for the 60E group for relative (V) over dot O-2max (P <
   0.01), blood lactate concentration (P < 0.05), RER (P < 0.05) and RPE (P
   < 0.05). The results suggest that frequent verbal encouragement (every
   20 s and 60 s in the present study) leads to significantly greater
   maximum effort in a treadmill test than when no encouragement is given
   or when the encouragement is infrequent (i.e. every 180 s).},

Abstract = {A possible function of laryngeal air sacs in apes and gibbons was
   investigated by examining the relationships between air sac
   distribution, call rate, call duration and body weight in a phylogenetic
   context. The results suggest that lack of sacs in the smaller gibbons
   and in humans is a derived feature. Call parameters in primates, such as
   rate and duration, scaled to resting breathing rate (and therefore to
   body weight) only in species without air sacs, which appear to modify
   these relationships. Apes and larger gibbons may be able to produce fast
   extended call sequences without the risk of hyperventilating because
   they can re-breathe exhaled air from their air sacs. Humans may have
   lost air sacs during their evolutionary history because they are able to
   modify their speech breathing patterns and so reduce any tendency to
   hyperventilate. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

Title = {Factors that alter body fat, body mass, and fat-free mass in pediatric
   obesity},
Journal = {MEDICINE AND SCIENCE IN SPORTS AND EXERCISE},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {487-496},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of
   exercise treatment programs on changes in body mass, fat-free mass, and
   body fat in obese children and adolescents. Methods: By using the
   meta-analytic approach, studies that met the following criteria were
   included in our analyses: 1) at least six subjects per group; 2) subject
   groups consisting of children in the 5- to 17-yr age range; 3) pretest
   and posttest values for either body mass, percent body fat, or fat-free
   mass (FFM); 4) used exercise as a mode of treatment (e.g., walking,
   jogging, cycle ergometry, high-repetition resistance exercise, and
   combinations); 6) training pro-rams greater than or equal to 3 wk; 7)
   full-length publications (not conference proceedings); 8) apparently
   ``healthy{''} children (i.e., free from endocrine diseases and
   disorders); and 9) published studies in English language journals only.
   Results: A total of 120 investigations were located that addressed the
   issue of exercise as a method of treatment in pediatric obesity. Of
   those, 30 met our criteria for inclusion. Across all designs and
   categories, fixed-effects modeling yielded significant decreases in the
   following dependent variables: 1) percent body fat (mean = 0.70 +/-
   0.35; 95\% Cl = 0.21 to 1.1); 2) FFM (mean = 0.50 +/- 0.38; 95\% CI =
   0.03 to 0.57); 3) body mass (mean = 0.34 +/- 0.18; 95\% CI = 0.01 to
   0.46); 4) BMI (mean = 0.76 +/- 0.55; 95\% CI = 4.24 to 1.7), and 5) (V)
   over dotO(2max) (mean = 0.52 +/- 0.16; 95\% CI = 0.18 to 0.89),
   respectively. Significant differences were found as a function of the
   type intervention groups (exercise vs exercise + behavioral
   modification; P < 0.04); body composition assessment methods (skinfold
   vs hydrostatic weighing, DEXA, and total body water; P < 0.006);
   exercise intensity (60-65\%, vs greater than or equal to 71\% (V) over
   dot O-2max; P < 0.01); duration (<= 30 min vs > 30 min; P < 0.03); and
   mode (aerobic vs aerobic + resistance training; P < 0.02). Stepwise
   linear regression suggested that initial body fat levels (or body mass),
   type of treatment intervention, exercise intensity, and exercise mode
   accounted for most of the variance associated with changes in body
   composition after training. Conclusions: Exercise is efficacious for
   reducing selected body composition variables in children and
   adolescents. The most favorable alterations in body composition occurred
   with 1) low-intensity, long-duration exercise; 2) aerobic exercise
   combined with high-repetition resistance training; and 3) exercise
   programs combined with a behavioral-modification component.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Infanticide by males has been hypothesized to be a naturally selected
   behavioral strategy that increases the infanticidal male's reproductive
   success. The sexual selection hypothesis has been challenged via
   alternative, nonadaptive hypotheses that dispute its empirical and
   theoretical bases. Two of the most widely recognized alternatives are
   the social pathology hypothesis, in which infanticide results from
   overcrowding or recent human disturbance, and the generalized aggression
   hypothesis, in which infanticide is an epiphenomenon of increased male
   aggression. We report the first case of infanticide in wild, seasonally
   breeding patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas) living at a low population
   density in a stable habitat, conditions which do not support the social
   pathology hypothesis. Its exceptional occurrence is consistent with the
   sexual selection hypothesis: over a 7-year period the infanticidal male
   was the only one of 13 resident males that was not present during the
   actual conception season but was present during the following birth
   season. Also consistent with this hypothesis, mothers were
   differentially targeted for male aggression, which increased sevenfold
   during the days surrounding the infanticide and then decreased to
   baseline levels after the infanticide. Aggression targeted at mothers
   does not support the generalized aggression hypothesis. As predicted by
   the sexual selection hypothesis, females began soliciting mating
   immediately after the infanticide, despite its occurrence in the
   nonconceptive season.},

   transfer rate compared with the current standard. Therefore, an array
   processing method performs with a set of four collocated sensors, the
   spatial responses of which are different one from each other. This
   diversity induces a well-conditioned problem of spatio-temporal
   equalization which tends to reduce the effect of multi-paths
   interference. The implemented method resorts to a classical L.M.S.
   algorithm involving training sequences. Several waveforms have been
   tested and the experimental results reach the expected goal as the data
   transfer rate increases up to 15 kbits/s in a bandwidth of 3 kHz.},

   bring several primate extinctions unless urgent conservation action is
   taken. Primates occur in about half of the world's countries, and are in
   trouble in most of them. There are three major threats to primates:
   habitat loss, hunting (primarily for food but also for medicines, body
   parts, skins, trophies, and as agricultural pests), and live capture of
   primates for biomedical research and local pet trades. Unless effective
   conservation measures are implemented right at the start of the third
   millennium, primatology will be a dead subject. It is clearly the time
   for zoos and universities to work closely together to help ensure that
   this does not happen.},

Abstract = {I would argue that a broad-based, comparative primatological perspective
   is indispensable for a full understanding of human evolutionary biology.
   There are two major reasons for this. First, comparative studies permit
   the recognition of generally valid principles that cannot be identified
   through the study of a single species (Homo sapiens) or a small group of
   species (e.g., humans and great apes). Second, recognition of such
   general principles obviates the special pleading that so often
   characterizes narrow approaches to human evolution. The special
   advantages of a broad comparative primatological approach are
   illustrated here with three examples: 1) dating times of divergence, 2)
   investigation of the evolution of brain size, and 3) study of primate
   social systems.},

   performed an incremental cycle ergometer exercise test until voluntary
   exhaustion. Subjects were then divided into four groups according to the
   time course of the HR-PC. Groups were classified in regular HR response
   (k(HR2) > 0.2), indifferent HR response (0 < k(HR2) < 0.2), linear HR
   response (k(HR2) = 0), and inverted HR response (k(HR2) < 0). The first
   and the second lactate turn point (LTP1, LTP2) as well as the heart rate
   turn point (HRTP) were determined as submaximal markers of performance.
   Linear regression lines were calculated for HR in the three regions of
   energy supply defined by LTP1, and LTP2. Results: HR at LTP1 and HRmax
   was not significantly different between all four groups. HR at LTP2 was
   dependent on the time course of the HRPC and was significantly lower (P
   < 0.05) as k(HR2) decreased. Power output and blood lactate
   concentration at LTP1, LTP2 and maximal workload (P-max) were not
   significantly different between the groups. Conclusion: From our data,
   we conclude that target training HR detected by means of the \%HRmax
   method may be overestimated in cases where the HR response is not
   regular, as it was found in many of our subjects.},

Abstract = {Iron retention was studied in rats (Rattus norvegicus), doves
   (Streptopelia d. decaocto) and two species of mynahs (Acridotheres t.
   tristis and Gracula r. religiosa) fed two different pelleted diets (88.5
   and 567.9 mg Fe/kg diet). The doves and rats served as species that are
   not susceptible to iron storage, whereas the mynahs are known to develop
   iron overload frequently. The retention was calculated after measuring
   the uptake and elimination of a single dose of radioactive iron (Fe-59)
   using whole-body counting. It was hypothesized that the mynahs would
   retain more iron than the rats and doves, and that after dietary iron
   challenge the mynahs would downregulate iron retention less effectively.
   It is concluded that mynahs have much higher iron uptake and retention
   than doves, but a similar uptake to that in rats. The four studied
   species are able to downregulate iron retention, the doves being the
   most efficient. It is suggested that at least part of the susceptibility
   to iron overload in mynahs is related to a high iron absorption from the
   intestines regardless of body iron stores, which is comparable with the
   situation of hereditary haemochromatosis in man.},

Abstract = {The primary purpose of this study was to determine the maximal
   cardiorespiratory responses of 48, 5- to 6-year-old children (24 girls
   and 24 boys), who were tested on a treadmill (TM) and an electronically
   braked cycle ergometer (CE). We also examined the percentage of boys and
   girls who were able to achieve the criteria for reaching maximal oxygen
   consumption ((V)over dotO(2max)) on each testing mode. After an
   orientation period, each child was tested twice (once on the TM and once
   on the CE), with an interval of 1 week between tests. (V)over dotO(2max)
   was measured during progressive, all out, continuous TM and CE tests
   using standardized procedures. A 2x2 analysis of variance test
   (genderxexercise mode) with Bonferroni adjustment revealed the
   following: (1) there were no gender differences in any of the measured
   dependent variables, (2) the children produced a significantly higher
   relative (V)over dotO(2max) (ml(.)kg(-1.)min(-1)) and a higher absolute
   (V)over dotO(2max) (1(.)min(-1)) on the TM than on the CE (P < 0.001),
   (3) the children produced a higher heart rate on the TM than on the CE
   (P < 0.001), (4) the CE generated significantly higher values for
   respiratory exchange ratio (P < 0.001), (5) the criteria necessary to
   establish a maximal exercise effort were achieved on both the TM and the
   CE, and (6) all of the children reached two of the criteria associated
   with a maximal effort, while only 46\% of the children reached three
   criterion measures. There were no significant differences in the
   attainment of criterion measures between the TM and the CE. The results
   of this study indicate a lack of gender differences in maximal exercise
   testing in 5- to 6 year-old children, and that both the CE and the TM
   are effective modes of maximal cardiorespiratory testing in this age
   group.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the correlates of variation in dental development
   across the order Primates. We are particularly interested in how 1)
   dental precocity (percentage of total postcanine primary and secondary
   teeth that have erupted at selected absolute ages and life cycle stages)
   and 2) dental endowment at weaning (percentage of adult postcanine
   occlusal area that is present at weaning) are related to variation in
   body or brain size and diet in primates. We ask whether folivores have
   more accelerated dental schedules than do like-sized frugivores, and if
   so, to what extent this is part and parcel of a general pattern of
   acceleration of life histories in more folivorous taxa. What is the
   adaptive significance of variation in dental eruption schedules across
   the order Primates? We show that folivorous primate species tend to
   exhibit more rapid dental development ton an absolute scale) than
   comparably sized frugivores, and their dental development tends to be
   more advanced at weaning. Our data affirm an important role for brain
   (rather than body) size as a predictor of both absolute and relative
   dental development. Tests of alternative dietary hypotheses offer the
   strongest support for the foraging independence and food processing
   hypotheses. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Lateral bending of the lumbar spine during quadrupedalism in
   strepsirhines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {231-259},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Much research has been devoted to spinal kinematics of nonmammalian
   vertebrates, while comparatively little is known about the locomotor
   role of spinal movements in mammals, especially primates. This study,
   conducted at the Duke University Primate Center, examines the function
   of lateral spinal bending during quadrupedal walking among a diverse
   sample of strepsirhines. The taxa studied include Loris tardigradus (1),
   Nycticebus coucang (1), N. pygmaeus (1), Cheirogaleus medius (2),
   Varecia variegata (2), Eulemur fulvus (2), and a total sample size of
   261 strides. Lateral bending varies among the taxa with respect to both
   magnitude and effects of velocity, and does not appear to be correlated
   with body size. In addition, the timing of lateral bending during a
   stride appears to differ from that reported for other (nonmammalian)
   tetrapods. On average, maximum lateral flexion occurs just after
   ipsilateral foot touchdown, which may be functionally associated with
   touchdown of the contralateral forelimb during diagonal sequence gait.
   For some of the taxa, lateral flexion coincides more closely with foot
   touchdown as velocity increases, suggesting a functional role in
   increasing hindlimb stride length. Both of these timing patterns

Abstract = {Hand preference has been investigated in New World primates but the data
   obtained thus far are controversial. In this study we investigated hand
   preference in common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, during the execution
   of a reaching for food task. We used 46 adult common marmoset males (n =
   27) and females (n = 19) from the Universidade of Rio Grande do Norte
   colony, both wild and captive-born. To test the hand preference we used
   a device measuring 10 cm(2), with a central hole 1 cm in diameter, to
   force the animal to use only one hand to reach for food on a food dish
   located underneath. Each animal was tested 5 times and had to make a
   maximum of 20 successful attempts per session. A total of 100 successful
   attempts per animal and 4,600 successful attempts for all animals were
   recorded during the experiment. Latency and duration of the sessions
   were measured and we found preference for the use of one of the hands in
   common marmoset individuals, i.e. 45 of total of 46 animals used
   significantly more the right or the left hand when performing the task.
   However no bias at the population level was found. Females born in
   captivity presented an increase in the duration of latency for the First
   successful attempt and in the total duration of the test sessions. These
   findings might he indicating differences associated with a natural
   tendency for females to be more selective and to spend more time
   exploring alimentary sources. Additionally, captive-born females may
   have a constrain in developing cognitive abilities regarding foraging
   since they have food available during most part of the time.},

Abstract = {Examination of orbit size and optic foramen size in living primates
   reveals two adaptive phenomena. First, as noted by many authors, orbit
   size is strongly correlated with activity pattern. Comparisons of large
   samples of extant primates consistently reveal that nocturnal species
   exhibit proportionately larger orbits than diurnal species. Furthermore,
   nocturnal haplorhines (Tarsius and Aotus) have considerably larger
   orbits than similar-sized nocturnal strepsirrhines. Orbital hypertrophy
   in Tarsius and Aotus accommodates the enormously enlarged eyes of these
   taxa. This extreme ocular hypertrophy seen in extant nocturnal
   haplorhines is an adaptation for both enhanced visual acuity and
   sensitivity in conditions of low light intensity.
   Second, the relative size of the optic foramen is highly correlated with
   the degree of retinal summation and inferred visual acuity. Diurnal
   haplorhines exhibit proportionately larger optic foramina, less central
   retinal summation, and much higher visual acuity than do all other
   primates. Diurnal strepsirrhines exhibit a more subtle but significant
   parallel enlargement of the optic foramen and a decrease in retinal
   summation relative to the condition seen in nocturnal primates.
   These twin osteological variables of orbit size and optic foramen size
   may be used to draw inferences regarding the activity pattern, retinal
   anatomy, and visual acuity of fossil primates. Our measurements
   demonstrate that the omomyiforms Microchoerus, Necrolemur, Shoshonius,
   and Tetonius, adapiform Pronycticebus, and the possible lorisiform
   Plesiopithecus were likely nocturnal on the basis of orbit diameter. The
   adapiforms Leptadapis, Adapis, and Notharctus, the phylogenetically
   enigmatic Rooneyia, the early anthropoids Proteopithecus, Catopithecus,
   and Aegyptopithecus, and early platyrrhine Dolichocebus were likely
   diurnal. The activity pattern of the platyrrhine Tremacebus is obscure.
   Plesiopithecus, Pronycticebus, Microchoerus, and Necrolemur probably had
   eyes that were very similar to those of extant nocturnal primates, with
   a high degree of retinal summation and rod-dominated retinae. Leptadapis
   and Rooneyia likely had eyes similar to those of extant diurnal
   strepsirrhines, with moderate degrees of retinal summation, a larger
   cone:rod ratio than in nocturnal primates, and, more speculatively,
   well-developed areae centrales similar to those of diurnal
   strepsirrhines. Adapis exhibited uncharacteristically high degrees of
   retinal summation for a small-eyed (likely diurnal) primate. None of the
   adapiform or omomyiform taxa for which we were able to obtain optic
   foramen dimensions exhibited the extremely high visual acuity
   characteristic of extant diurnal haplorhines. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {In this study of masticatory maturation, the ontogeny of the
   histochemical fiber type composition of musculus masseter is examined in
   the omnivorous miniature swine (Sus scrofa). Fiber type characteristics
   are interpreted by comparison with electromyography (EMG) recorded
   during feeding behavior. Similar to locomotion studies, the results
   suggest a correspondence between the composition and arrangement of
   motor units and their recruitment pattern.
   Serial sections of masseter muscles from 10 minipigs, ranging from 2
   weeks to slightly over 1 year of age, were stained for myosin adenosine
   triphosphatase (mATPase) activity to distinguish slow-twitch from
   fast-twitch fibers, and for nicotinamide adenosine
   dehydrogenase-tetrazolium reductase to assess the aerobic capacity of
   the same fibers. Although maintaining a uniformly high aerobic capacity
   throughout ontogeny and in adult animals, a transition is observed in
   the relative proportions of fast- and slow-twitch fibers. The primarily
   fast-twitch neonatal pig masseter eventually comprises similar to
   25-30\% slow-twitch fibers in adults, with a higher predominance of slow
   fibers in the deep (vs. superficial) and anterior (vs, posterior)
   regions of the muscle. Furthermore, while individual fibers of adult
   masseters generally stain for either alkaline- or acid-stable mATPase
   activity, a substantial proportion of cells in developing animals
   exhibits the presence of both isozymes.
   EMG results indicate functional heterogeneity within the masseter of
   adult pigs. During chewing, when pig chow is replaced by cracked corn,
   EMG: activity in the deep portion of the muscle either decreases or
   increases slightly. In the superficial portion, however, muscle
   amplitudes become dramatically higher for corn, surpassing levels
   generated for chewing the less obdurate chow. These results are
   consistent with a behavioral transition from neonatal suckling to
   sustained mastication of foods of more complex textures eaten by adult
   pigs. The relationship between these fiber type and EMG results for pig
   masseter corresponds to those pertaining to motor unit recruitment in
   the extensor muscles of locomotion. Implications of this work for the
   evolutionary morphology of mastication also are discussed. (C) 2000

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of various modes
   of training on the time-course of changes in lipoprotein-lipid profiles
   in the blood, cardiovascular fitness, and body composition after 16
   weeks of training and 6 weeks of detraining in young women. A group of
   48 sedentary but healthy women {[}mean age 20.4 (SD 1) years] were
   matched and randomly placed into a control group (CG, n = 12), an
   aerobic training group (ATG, n = 12), a resistance training group (RTG,
   n = 12), or a cross- training group that combined both aerobic and
   resistance training (XTG, n = 12). The ATG, RTG and XTG trained for 16
   weeks and were monitored for changes in blood concentrations of
   lipoprotein-lipids, cardiovascular fitness, body composition, and
   dietary composition throughout a 16 week period of training and 6 weeks
   of detraining. The ATG significantly reduced blood concentrations of
   triglycerides (TRI) (P < 0.05) and significantly increased blood
   concentrations of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) after 16
   weeks of training. The correlation between percentage fat and HDL-C was
   0.63 (P < 0.05), which explained 40\% of the variation in HDL-C, while
   the correlation between maximal oxygen uptake ((V) over dotO(2max)) and
   HDL-C was 0.48 (P < 0.05), which explained 23\% of the variation in
   HDL-C. The ATG increased (V) over dotO(2max) by 25\% (P < 0.001) and
   decreased percentage body fat by 13\% (P < 0.05) after 16 weeks. Each of
   the alterations in the ATG had disappeared after the 6 week detraining
   period. The concentration of total cholesterol (TC), TRI, HDL-C and low
   density lipoprotein-cholesterol in the blood did not change during the
   study in RTG, XTG and CC. The RTG increased upper and lower body
   strength by 29\% (P < 0.001) and 38\%, respectively. The 6 week
   detraining strength values obtained in RTG were significantly greater
   than those obtained at baseline. The XTG increased upper and lower body
   strength by 19\% (P < 0.01) and 25\% (P < 0.001), respectively. The 6
   week detraining strength values obtained in XTG were significantly
   greater than those obtained at baseline. The RTG, XTG and CG did not
   demonstrate any significant changes in either (V) over dotO(2max), or
   body composition during the training and detraining periods. The results
   of this study suggest that aerobic-type exercise improves
   lipoprotein-lipid profiles, cardiorespiratory fitness and body
   composition in healthy, young women, while resistance training
   significantly improved upper and lower body strength only.},

   not consistent with the social pathology, side effect of male
   aggression, cannibalism, or the resource defense hypothesis, but were
   generally consistent with the sexual-selection hypothesis, First, most
   male attackers had risen in dominance rank because several high-ranking
   males had left the troop. Second, in 78\% of cases, male attackers had
   not previously been observed to mate with the mothers of victims,
   Moreover, analysis of subject animal DNA showed that males did not
   attack their own offspring. The two mothers who lost their unweaned
   infants, however, were not subsequently observed to mate. In fact,
   almost no mating behavior was observed in the troop. This was most
   likely due to a poor fruiting year. Resumption of mating by females who
   lost their infants may have been inhibited by an intervening
   environmental variable which suppressed female reproductive function.
   These observations contribute to a growing body of evidence which
   suggests that sexually selected infanticide can occur in seasonally
   breeding, multi-male, multi-female primate groups. Female Japanese
   macaques are known to mate with multiple males. We found evidence that
   female mating with multiple males inhibits contact aggression towards
   their infants. Adult males attacked infants eight times more often when
   they had not previously mated with the mother.},

Abstract = {Niche separation was documented in a year-long study of Varecia
   variegata rubra and Eulemur fulvus albifrons on the Masoala Peninsula,
   Madagascar. Feeding trees were measured, and diet, forest height, and
   forest site were recorded at 5-min time points on focal animals. For
   time point data, multivariate and bivariate analysis of frequencies was
   employed to examine how niche dimensions vary between species according
   to sex, season, and reproductive stage. V. v. rubra feeds in larger
   trees than E. f. albifrons. V. v. rubra has a diet consisting mainly of
   fruit, whereas E. f: albifrons has a more varied diet. V. v. rubra
   ranges mainly above 15 m in tree crowns, whereas E. f: albifrons ranges
   mainly below 15 m in a wide array of forest sites. Both species are
   largely frugivorous, but they harvest fruit in different-sized trees, in
   different quantities, and in different forest strata. Niche partitioning
   varies in tandem with seasonal shifts in climate and food availability
   and with reproductive stages. Seasonal shifts in forest site and forest
   height use are largely attributed to species-specific tactics for
   behavioral thermoregulation and predator avoidance. The diet off. f:
   albifrons is diverse whether examined by season or reproductive stage.
   However, females of both species diversify their diets with more
   low-fiber protein than males during gestation, lactation, and the hot
   seasons. This pattern is most pronounced for V. v. rubra females and may
   be directly attributed to high energetic investment in reproduction.
   These results suggest that niche partitioning may be driven more by the
   energetic requirements of reproductive females than males. (C) 2000

Abstract = {Aotus is one of the WHO-recommended primate models for studies in
   malaria, and several species can be infected with Plamodium falciparum
   or P. vivax. Here we describe the successful infection of the species A.
   infulatus from eastern Amazon with blood stages of P. falciparum. Both
   intact and splenectomized animals were susceptible to infection, the
   intact ones were able to keep parasitemias at lower levels for several
   days, but developed complications such as severe anemia: splenectomized
   monkeys developed higher parasitemias but no major complications. We
   conclude that A. infulatus is susceptible to P. falciparum infection and

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {Sexual and associated patterns of behavior of lesser galagos (Galago
   moholi) were recorded during an 18-month study conducted at the Nylsvley
   Nature Reserve in South Africa. Animals were trapped and fitted with
   radio transmitter belts in order to monitor nocturnal activities during
   twice-yearly mating seasons. Most copulations occurred during the last
   week in May, while a subsidiary (post-partum) mating season occurred in
   late September-early October. Females came into estrus sequentially
   during the May season. Adult males exhibited increase in body weight and
   testes volume during the mating season, changes which were most
   pronounced among the larger males (> 226g). Larger males also had the
   greatest mating success, initiating 88\% of observed copulations.
   Sixty-seven percent of matings involved more than one male copulating
   with the same female during her estrus, which lasted 1-3 days. Mounts
   were prolonged (range 2-53 min, mean 9.0 min) and males copulated
   repeatedly (23 times) with the same partner during a single night. These
   observations of sexual behavior and of large relative testes size in
   free-ranging lesser galagos are consistent with the occurrence of a
   dispersed mating system involving sperm competition in this nocturnal
   prosimian species. Am. J. Primatol. 51:79-88, 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {Patterns of home range overlap between individuals are key parameters
   used in discussions of sociality in nocturnal prosimians. Despite the
   importance of space use variables in defining social structure in
   nocturnal prosimians, researchers have yet to reach a consensus
   concerning the most reliable techniques for measuring patterns of home
   range use. In this paper, we review the methods used in 27 studies of
   nocturnal prosimian ranging behavior published since 1977. We discuss
   the usefulness and limitations of the various methods of data collection
   (radio tracking, trap mark, and identification of sleeping site
   locations) and data analysis (minimum convex polygon method, minimum
   concave polygon method, and quadrat analysis) used in these studies. We
   conclude that the most effective method for gathering data on individual
   movements and social interactions is direct observation of individual
   radio tagged animals during all-night follows. In those cases where
   radio tracking and/ or all-night follows are not possible, trap mark
   techniques can be used, although they tend to greatly underestimate home
   range size. We recommend that data collected on nocturnal prosimian
   ranging behavior be analyzed using the minimum convex polygon method,
   quadrat analysis, and, perhaps, one other of the more mathematically
   sophisticated techniques popular in studies of non-primate mammals.
   Finally, we urge researchers to employ standardized methods of data
   collection and data analysis in future studies of range use in nocturnal
   prosimians. Without standardization of methods, quantitative comparisons
   of the findings from different studies are biologically meaningless and
   prevent cross-species comparisons of space use and its relation to
   sociality. Am. J. Primatol. 51:3-19, 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   few showed significant hand preferences. Only for termite feeding and
   detaching material from fruits did the majority show significant
   lateralization; no tasks elicited exclusive use of 1 hand. Preference
   appeared labile, because in 2 tasks, population trends reversed with

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE AND PHYSICAL FITNESS},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background. There is a progressive decline in the functional capacity
   (FC) of the cardiovascular system with aging. This deterioration is
   reflected in a decrease in the maximal oxygen consumption ((V) over dot
   O(2)max). The purpose of this quantitative review was to determine the
   effects of various components of the exercise prescription on FC in
   older individuals (ages 46-90 years).
   Methods. This study synthesized the results of 27 studies by
   meta-analysis, which generated a total of 34 effect sizes, Each effect
   size represented an independent measure of the impact of physical
   training on maximal oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O(2)max). A total
   of 720 subjects were included in this review, The studies were coded
   according to intensity, session duration, length of training and mode of
   exercise.
   Results, A significant difference was found (p<0.001) in FC between
   studies in which the intensity of exercise was greater than or equal to
   to 80\% of (V) over dot O(2)max compared to those with training
   intensities of 60-75\% of (V) over dot O(2)max. A significant difference
   was found (p<0.002) for exercise duration; namely, a duration of greater
   than or equal to 30 minutes produced significantly greater improvements
   in (V) over dot O(2)max when compared to an exercise duration less than
   30 minutes. There was no significant difference reported in FC between
   studies that lasted 15 or more weeks in duration compared to those that
   lasted less than 15 weeks, Finally, there was no significant difference
   reported in FC in studies that utilized a walk/jog training mode
   compared to those which utilized cycle ergometry.
   Conclusions. Despite the inevitable decline in (V) over dot O(2)max with
   aging, exercise training imparts favorable adaptations in FC in
   individuals well into their seventh and eighth decades of life.},

Abstract = {Interest in the benefits of exercise has prompted increased research
   examining the relationship between physical activity and health status
   in adults. More recently, considerable research effort has been directed
   toward the role of physical activity in young children as a precursor to
   adult physical fitness. The purpose of this study was to estimate the
   relationship between physical activity measured via accelerometry and
   body mass index, body mass, body composition, and physical fitness in
   fourth-grade boys and girls during physical education lessons. 54
   fourth-grade students in rural Pennsylvania. (28 girls, M age 9.6,
   SD=.56; 26 boys, M age 9.5, SD=.51) were subjects. Girls were
   significantly less active during all lessons measured (p<.001). The
   results of linear regression analyses indicated that physical activity
   was negatively associated with body mass index, body mass, and body fat
   percentage (p<.05), and positively associated with physical fitness
   (VO(2)max) (p<.01). These data indicate the need for curricular
   intervention to motivate girls to increase their activity during
   structured physical education lessons and demonstrate the efficacy of
   the body mass index as a screening tool within the schools.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to elucidate the physiological basis of
   hibernation under tropical conditions. Body temperature and metabolic
   rate were measured in the held in Cheirogaleus medius, a small Malagasy
   primate, which spends up to seven months hibernating. During
   hibernation, the body temperature tracked the highly fluctuating ambient
   temperature passively, resulting in high diurnal fluctuations. This may
   explain the apparent absence of periodic arousals. Metabolic rate was
   low during hibernation, compared to normothermic stages. Hibernation in
   C. medius therefore presumably represents an important and effective
   adaptation for the successful survival of the unfavourable dry season of

Title = {Allocare in a nocturnal primate: Data on the spectral tarsier, Tarsius
   spectrum},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},

Volume = {71},
Number = {1-2},

Abstract = {Non-maternal infant care in many of the small-bodied New World primate
   species has been hypothesized by some researchers to be related to the
   high infant/adult weight ratio found in these species. The spectral
   tarsier, Tarsius spectrum, an Old World primate, has one of the highest
   infant/adult weight ratios of any primate, with infants weighing between
   20-33\% of adult weight at birth. On the basis of the hypothesized
   relationship between allocare and the infant/adult weight ratio, it is
   predicted that the spectral tarsier will also exhibit extensive
   allocaretaking behaviour. The results of this study indicate that
   although spectral tarsiers show care by male and female subadults as
   well as adult males, it is extremely limited compared to the extensive
   allocaretaking behavior observed in New World primate species such as
   Aotus and Callicebus. Spectral tarsier subadult females provide
   substantially more allocare to infants than do subadult males or adult
   males. Female subadults were observed sharing food, transporting,
   grooming, playing, alarm calling, babysitting and maintaining physical
   contact with infants more than other age/sex classes. Although the
   amount of allocare exhibited by adult males and subadult males was much
   less than that exhibited by female subadults, the data suggest that
   adult and subadult male spectral tarsiers do play a small part in the
   care and socialization of the infant. Adult males and subadult males
   were both observed occasionally engaging in allocaretaking behaviors
   such as grooming and playing, as well as frequently patrolling and
   defending the territory's boundaries. The results from this study
   suggest that although a high infant/adult weight ratio may be a
   prerequisite for selection to favor extensive allocare, it is not a
   causal factor. Additional research is needed in order to understand
   better the selective pressures involved a nd the costs and benefits of
   providing allocare to subadults and adult male spectral tarsiers.

Title = {Laterality of tail resting posture in three species of New World
   primates},
Journal = {NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {38},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1040-1046},
Abstract = {A variety of mammalian species including prosimian and simian primates
   wrap their tails around their bodies us a means of thermoregulation and
   for reasons of comfort during resting or sleep. Adopting such a resting
   posture requires an animal to move its tail either to the right or to
   the left of the midline of its body, and thus to perform a lateralized
   behavior. The purpose of this study was to assess the occurrence of
   lateral biases in tail resting posture in three species of New World
   primates. Twenty squirrel monkeys, spider monkeys, and howler monkeys,
   respectively. were observed and data on tail resting posture were
   collected and analyzed. The results demonstrate (1) that individual
   squirrel monkeys and spider monkeys exhibit highly significant lateral
   biases in tail resting posture: (2) a lack of a lateral bins at the
   group level: (3) that howler monkeys fail to show side preferences in
   tail wrapping (4) a lack of sex differences in this behavior in all
   three species: and (5) a lack of significant correlations between
   preferred side of tail resting posture and preferred side of hand use in
   simple reaching tasks which had been assessed with a subset of animals
   in previous studies, Thus, the present study provides evidence for a
   behavioral asymmetry which is well-known to occur in rats but has not
   been described so far in nonhuman primatos. and which might offer an
   additional approach to the investigation of the mechanisms underlying
   functional cerebral asymmetries, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {Scent-marking in mammals has been frequently related to within-group
   social and reproductive dominance and to defense of territory and
   resources. We studied the scent-marking behavior of five wild groups of
   common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, during 5 months of the fruiting
   season in northeastern Brazil. Circumgenital marking was the most common
   type of marking. Marks were distributed throughout the home range and
   were deposited mainly during travel and intergroup encounters. Although
   marks were commonly deposited at gum trees, there was no evidence that
   the animals used scent marks to label fruiting trees or sleeping sites.
   Contrary to expectations, reproductively dominant females did not mark
   more than reproductively subordinate females. Moreover, during
   intergroup encounters, reproductively subordinate females displayed
   higher frequencies of scent-marking than the reproductively dominant
   females of their group. Our results suggest that scent-marking is not
   strictly tied to reproductive dominance or territorial (or resource)
   defense in common marmosets. Because marks provide information about
   individual identity and reproductive condition, scent marks could serve
   different functions when used by different individuals. The high
   frequency of marking by reproductively subordinate females during
   intergroup encounters suggests that scent-marking might be used to
   signal to individuals of neighboring groups. Our data highlight the
   importance of social and ecological variables in scent-marking behavior.},

Title = {The problem of adult play fighting: A comparative analysis of play and
   courtship in primates},
Journal = {ETHOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {105},
Number = {9},
Pages = {783-806},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Although play fighting, like play generally, is predominantly a feature
   of the juvenile phase, such behavior persists in the adults of many
   species. There are two major contexts in which adults engage in play
   fighting - with juveniles and with other adults. The least attention has
   been given to adult-adult play. However, one pattern that has been noted
   by several authors is that the most commonly occurring context of
   adult-adult play fighting is during courtship, and that this is more
   likely to occur in solitary species. Supposedly, such play could
   function to overcome the aggressiveness of potential pairmates
   unfamiliar with one another, or as a means of evaluating mate quality by
   one or both partners. By contrasting the presence and degree of play
   fighting during courtship with the degree of male-female familiarity,
   the hypothesis that the former is influenced by the latter is tested.
   Data on 35 species of primates, from 15 families, were compiled from the
   literature and compared using a method of independent contrasts that
   incorporates information on phylogenetic relationships. A significant
   regression was found, with the degree of male-female familiarity
   accounting for 40\% of the variance in courtship play. Therefore, our
   data support the hypothesis that play fighting in courtship is
   influenced by male-female patterns of association. However, the data
   also indicate that other factors must influence the occurrence of play
   fighting amongst adults, not only during courtship, but also in
   nonsexual contexts. The broader context of adult-adult play in mammals
   is discussed.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {109},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A comparative morphometric analysis of isolated proximal and
   intermediate phalanges attributed to the paromomyids Ignacius
   graybullianus and Phenacolemur simonsi was undertaken to test the
   hypothesis that these fossil phalanges exhibit evidence of a
   dermopteran-like interdigital patagium, Linear dimensions were collected
   for the fossil phalanges and a comparative sample of associated proximal
   and intermediate phalanges representing extant tree squirrels, tree
   shrews, dermopterans (colugos), gliding rodents and marsupials, and
   prosimian primates. Quantitative data indicate that the proximal and
   intermediate phalanges of paromomyids are most similar in their overall
   shape to those of the dermopteran Cynocephalus. The proximal phalanges
   of paromomyids and colugos possess well-developed flexor sheath ridges
   and broad, high shafts, whereas the intermediate phalanges of these taxa
   are most similar to one another in their trochlear morphology.
   Discriminant analysis indicates that all of the paromomyid intermediate
   phalanges resemble those from colugo toes more so than those from colugo
   fingers. Moreover, the relative length and midshaft proportions of both
   the proximal and intermediate phalanges of paromomyids closely resemble
   those of several squirrels that lack an interdigital patagium. The
   following conclusions are drawn from this study: 1) paromomyids share a
   number of derived phalangeal features with modern dermopterans that may
   be indicative of a phylogenetic relationship between them, 2) existing
   intermediate phalanges of paromomyids are inconsistent with the ``mitten
   gliding{''} hypothesis because they do not possess the distinctive
   length and midshaft proportions characteristic of colugo manual
   intermediate phalanges, and 3) paromomyids share with colugos and the
   scaly-tailed squirrel Anomalurus several aspects of phalangeal
   morphology functionally related to frequent vertical clinging and
   climbing on large-diameter arboreal supports. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Prosimian and anthropoid females are generally thought to have divergent
   reproductive patterns, characterized by circumscribed and
   situation-dependent receptivity. This dichotomy underpins the
   traditional view that nonreproductive mating serves a social function in
   anthropoid females, distinguishing them from prosimians which, like most
   other mammals, mate only when conception is most probable. Circumscribed
   estrous cycles differ from anthropoid menstrual cycles by the presence
   of menstruation, and greater flexibility in timing and longer duration
   of receptivity in the latter: The degree to which sexual behavior is
   tightly synchronized to periovulatory events in Propithecus verreauxi
   was assessed via the behavioral, hormonal, and social correlates of
   reproduction in a free-ranging population. I collected data from two
   social groups before and during the 1990-1991 and 1991-1992 breeding
   seasons at Beta Mahafaly, Madagascar. I also conducted 644 focal-animal
   hours and collected 485 fecal samples from five marked females in the
   Vaovao and Vavy Masiaka social groups. Estrus was behaviorally
   characterized by 0.5-96-h periods of receptivity when females were
   motivated and willing to mate, the latter not always coincident with
   periovulatory events. Females exhibited age- and rank-related
   asynchronous receptivity, and in some cases, periovulatory synchrony
   within groups. Sifaka were not pair-bonded Most females mated with
   multiple males, temporally ordering partners based on male residence and
   age. Mating was limited by male mate-guarding and sexual aggression by

Abstract = {A reveiw was made of the use of a specific strain of Anopheles freeborni
   from California (F-1) that has been used extensively in experimental
   investigations of malaria for more than 50 years. The F-1 strain of An.
   freeborni has been shown to be a suitable experimental host and vector
   for different species of Plasmodium that cause malaria in humans and
   nonhuman primates for biologic, immunologic, and chemotherapeutic
   studies. Eleven species of Plasmodium fully completed sporogonic
   development; development of sporozoites within mature oocysts occurred
   in an additional 7 species. Transmission through An. freeborni from
   human to human, monkey to human, or monkey to monkey has been
   demonstrated for 9 species of Plasmodium.},

Abstract = {Removal of the olfactory bulbs of male golden hamsters results in a
   marked increase in tonic gonadotropin, prolactin and testosterone
   secretion which counteracts inhibitory effects of manipulations such as
   maintenance on short photoperiod, food restriction or treatment with
   gonadal steroids. The bulbectomy-induced increase in hormone secretion
   is interpreted to reflect a tonic inhibitory influence of the olfactory
   bulbs. This inhibition is not dependent upon chemosensory stimulation
   and may be mediated by olfactory bulb fibers projecting through the
   lateral olfactory tract to or through the olfactory tubercle. This
   review will relate these studies conducted on hamsters to results in
   other species, such as the rat, where the olfactory bulbs enhance serum
   gonadotropin levels. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Primate males have only recently returned to the center stage of
   socioecological research. This review surveys new studies that examine
   variation in the behavior of adult males and their role in social
   evolution. It is shown that group size, composition, and social behavior
   are determined not only by resource distribution, predation risk, and
   other ecological factors, but that life history traits and social
   factors, especially those related to sexual coercion, can have equally
   profound consequences for social systems. This general point is
   illustrated by examining male behavior at three levels: the evolution of
   permanent associations between males and females, the causes and
   consequences of variation in the number of males between group-living
   species, and the determinants of social relationships within and between
   the sexes. Direct and indirect evidence reviewed in connection with all
   three questions indicates that the risk of infanticide has been a
   pervasive force in primate social evolution. Several areas are
   identified for future research on male life histories that should
   contribute to a better understanding of male reproductive strategies and
   corresponding female counterstrategies.},

Abstract = {Social relationships between adult males and females vary widely among

   to the period of copulation or female estrus.(1) Nevertheless, cohesive
   male-female bonds persist beyond estrus in some species, particularly
   nonhuman primates,(2) for reasons that remain largely obscure.
   Protection from male infanticide has been offered as a potential benefit
   to females of bonds with males in a variety of primates, including
   mountain gorillas and gibbons. Here I evaluate this hypothesis within a
   comparative framework that considers alternative costs and benefits of
   social relationships between the sexes.},

Abstract = {In 1995, the course ``Introduction to Anthropology/Primatology{''} was
   organized at the Universite de Mahajanga in collaboration with the
   Anthropological Institute of the University of Zurich as a pilot
   project. The defined goals were: (1) presentation of primatology as an
   interesting and important subject, which may be of special relevance for
   Madagascar; (2) initiation of a test case to see how it would operate in
   general; (3) provision of a starting point for future adjustments and
   potential extensions. Two questionnaires filled out by students before
   and after the course showed that they came from all over the island
   (such that knowledge would potentially be widely distributed later),
   that they were relatively old for the study level achieved, and that
   knowledge of the natural richness of Madagascar at the beginning of the
   lectures was lower than expected. Students judged the course to be
   interesting and worth following, feeling that it should be offered
   again; many believed that they had understood quite a lot. In fact,
   however, some of the messages of the lecture course did not transfer
   very well. As a pilot project, the course was successful in several
   realms but failed to catalyze longer term teaching and research
   activities for various reasons. An evaluation of the experiences made
   and of results of the questionnaires is presented.},

Abstract = {The diurnal rodent, Octodon degus, exhibits robust sex differences in
   several circadian measures, including circadian period (tau) and
   reentrainment rates to photic and nonphotic (social) zeitgebers. The
   neural substrates underlying such physiological differences remain
   unknown. In female degus, olfactory bulbectomies (BX) inhibit
   socially-facilitated reentrainment, but do not alter photic
   reentrainment, entrained measures, or tau in constant darkness (DD).
   This experiment investigated the effects of EX in male degus on (i)
   photic reentrainment rates of circadian rhythms following a 6-h phase
   advance of the Light-dark (LD) cycle; (ii) photic entrainment; (iii) tau
   of free-running activity rhythms in DD; and (iv) body weight, paired
   testis weight, and the reproductive hormones, testosterone,
   androstenedione and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). EX significantly
   delayed photic reentrainment rates. They did not, however, modify tau,
   the phase of activity onset or offset, amplitude or duration (alpha) of
   the activity rhythm, mean daily locomotor activity levels, or body
   weight. FSH, testosterone and androstenedione were unaffected by EX,
   whereas paired testis weights were significantly greater in EX degus
   compared with shams. Thus, the olfactory bulbs influence photic
   reentrainment of circadian rhythms and modestly affect the reproductive
   axis in male degus. Our results suggest that the olfactory bulbs may be
   a neural source of observed sex differences in photic reentrainment in
   degus, and highlight interspecies variation in the olfactory bulbs'
   effects on entrained and free-running circadian rhythms and on
   reproduction. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

   breeding season is restricted to the rainy summer months. To determine
   the role of daylength on metabolic rate and water loss in this nocturnal
   primate, we measured body mass, oxygen consumption at 25 degrees C
   (RMR), circadian water loss through urine output (UO) and evaporation
   (EWL) in eight males exposed to either short days (8L:16D SD) or long
   days (14L:10D LD), under controlled captive conditions. Exposure to SD
   led to a ponderal increase (maximal body mass: 125 +/- 4 g, N= 8), and
   to significant changes in RMR and water loss,both reaching lowest values
   after 3 months under SD (0.84 +/- 0.04 ml O-2 h(-1) g(-1) and 38 +/- 0.3
   mg H2O g(-1) day(-1), respectively). Following exposure to LD, body mass
   decreased to 77 +/- 3 g (N = 8), whereas both RMR and water loss, mainly
   through EWL, significantly increased (P < 0.001), the highest value
   occurring after 2 months (1.51 +/- 0.08 ml O-2 h(-1) g(-1) and 87 +/- 7
   mgH(2)O g(-1) day(-1), respectively). Moreover, independent of
   daylength, circadian changes in EWL were characterized by significantly
   reduced values during the diurnal rest. The results demonstrate that
   daylength variations affect the physiology of this tropical primate,
   allowing anticipatory adaptation to seasonal environmental constraints.

Title = {Positional behavior and vertebral morphology in atelines and cebines},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {105},
Number = {3},
Pages = {333-354},

Abstract = {Atelines are of particular interest to primate evolutionary studies
   because they converge with hominoids in postcranial anatomy, including
   the vertebral column. Currently, our understanding of ateline vertebral
   morphology is limited to mainly qualitative descriptions and functional
   interpretations based on general categories of positional behavior Even
   less is known about the vertebrae of other platyrrhines. This study more
   closely examines vertebral form and function in atelines and cebines by
   combining direct field observations of axial postures and movements,
   assessments of spinal loading regimes, and a detailed vertebral
   morphometric analysis. Field observations (Corcovado, Costa Rica) on
   Ateles geoffroyi, Alouatta palliata, Cebus capucinus, and Saimiri
   oerstedii were quantified in conjunction with a morphometric analysis of
   ateline and cebine lumbar vertebrae. Hylobates was also included for
   comparison.
   Compared to Cebus and Saimiri, atelines engage more frequently in
   postures and locomotor behaviors that induce pronounced bending loads on
   the spine. All atelines share lumbar adaptations for resisting bending,
   including ventrodorsally elongated vertebral bodies and perpendicularly
   oriented transverse processes. Among atelines, lumbar region lengths and
   vertebral bodies are shortest in Ateles and Brachyteles, longest in
   Alouatta (resembling Cebus), and intermediate in Lagothrix. Compared to
   Cebus and all atelines, Saimiri has a relatively longer lumbar region,
   longer and less ventrodorsally expanded vertebral bodies, and more
   ventrally oriented transverse processes. These features accentuate
   bending loads, but increase the sagittal flexibility required for
   leaping. Vertebral convergence between hylobatids and atelines is more
   readily interpretable as a product of shared spinal loading patterns
   than shared positional behaviors. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Background. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the
   exercise tolerance, body composition and blood lipids in
   African-American women, possessing greater than or equal to 30\% body
   fat, following six weeks of endurance training.
   Methods. Oxygen consumption ((V) over dotO(2)), central hemodynamics,
   blood lipids, body weight, body fat, and the body mass index of seven
   subjects (21.0+/-10.8 yrs) were studied. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure
   (BP), exercise duration, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), blood
   lactate (bLA) and (V) over dotO(2) were obtained in response to a
   maximal exercise tolerance test on a motorized treadmill. Subjects
   trained three times per week for 50 minutes per session (30 minutes at
   70\% maximal oxygen consumption ((V) over dotO(2max))
   Results. Dependent ``t{''}-tests revealed significant (p<0.05) increases
   in (V) over dotO(2)max, 27\%; exercise duration, 31\%; as well as peak
   HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and bLA. Values for submaximal HR,
   SEP, RPE during the post-training test were lower In addition, body
   weight, body fat and the body mass index decreased 2.2\%, 1.3\% and
   3.4\% respectively. There were no changes in blood lipids.
   Conclusions. These findings suggest short-term training at 70\% (V) over
   dotO(2)max provides the necessary stimulus for obese women to improve
   exercise tolerance and body composition. However, the training stimulus
   is insufficient to alter lipid profiles.},

Abstract = {Endocrine studies of captive strepsirrhine primates suggest that
   physical environment and social factors mediate inter-individual
   variations in testicular function and serum testosterone (sT) in males.
   While these studies have made major contributions to our understanding
   of the individual proximate mechanisms influencing androgen activity in
   male strepsirrhines, none have investigated how these mechanisms work
   coincidentally in free-ranging populations. In this study we used fecal
   steroid analysis to examine androgen-behavior interactions associated
   with reproduction in free-ranging male Propithecus verreauxi. Behavioral
   and hormone data were collected from two social groups during the 1990 -
   91 and 1991 - 92 breeding seasons at Beta Mahafaly, Madagascar. Solid
   phase and radioimmunoassay techniques were used to quantify testosterone
   (T) in 105 desiccated fecal samples collected weekly from seven males,
   Results suggest that 1) solid phase extraction and radioimmunoassay
   techniques were reliable and accurate methods for quantifying T in
   sifaka feces; 2) fecal T (fT) elevations spanned a. minimum of 4 months,
   peak levels occurring 1 month prior to the January onset of the breeding
   season; 3) fecal T concentrations were influenced by developmental
   factors and, among mature males, social factors associated with rank,
   intergroup aggression, and group instability. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Title = {Are Eulemur species pair-bonded? Social organization and mating
   strategies in Eulemur fulvus rufus from 1988-1995 in southeast
   Madagascar},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {105},
Number = {2},
Pages = {153-166},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Strong social relationships have been reported between adult male and
   female prosimian primates in the genera Eulemur and Varecia and have
   been referred to as ``pair-bonding.{''} It has been hypothesized that
   females benefit from these affiliative relationships with an adult male
   by having protection against infanticidal males, implying that the male
   member of the dyad also is the father of her offspring. I evaluated this
   hypothesis and whether or not the term pair-bond was appropriate by
   using field data collected on two groups of Eulemur fulvus rufus in
   southeastern Madagascar. Four predictions were tested: 1) male-female
   dyads will be stable throughout the year, 2) male-female dyads will be,
   more prevalent during the mating season, and/or the birth season when
   infants would be most vulnerable to infanticide, 3) females should
   copulate either exclusively or most often with their male dyad partner
   than with other males during the mating and/or birth season, and 4)
   rates of aggression mill be higher between males or between females and
   males who are not their dyad partner. Predictions 1, 2, and 3 were not
   supported and Prediction 4 was only partially supported, Adult
   male-female dyads however, were more prominent in feeding concerts
   during the mating season and food scarcity periods. Most aggression
   occurred during feeding between males and nondyad group members. Since
   female feeding rates were often higher when feeding near male dyad
   partners, adult male-female dyads may serve as a way of increasing
   foraging efficiency for the female, which in turn may influence
   reproductive success. All males who were dyad partners also copulated
   first and more frequently with all females. It is suggested that
   ``dyad{''} is a better descriptive term than pair-bonding for the social
   patterns observed since dyads were comprised of same-sex individuals,
   were temporary, and did not exclusively serve a reproductive function.

Abstract = {Year-round association between adult males and females is common in
   primates, even though internal gestation and lactation predispose males
   to mate-desertion in the majority of mammals. Because there is little a
   priori support for alternative explanations, we hypothesized that
   permanent male-female association in primates serves to reduce the risk
   of infanticide by strange males whenever females and infants are closely
   associated. For a phylogenetic test of this hypothesis, we reconstructed
   the evolution of male-female and female-infant association among
   primates. The results of Maddison's concentrated changes test confirmed
   the prediction that mother-infant association, as opposed to infant
   parking, and female-male association did not evolve independently.
   Changes in litter size and activity, in contrast, were not significantly
   associated with evolutionary changes in male-female association. Thus,
   we demonstrate a fundamental link between primate life history and
   social behaviour, explain the most basic type of variation in primate
   social organization, and propose an additional determinant of social
   organization that may also operate in other mammals.},

Abstract = {The chromosomal distribution of the (TTAGGG)(n) telomeric repetitive
   sequences was studied in the Malagasy species Eulemur fulvus fulvus (2n
   = 60), Eulemur rubriventer (2n = 50), Eulemur coronatus (2n = 46) and
   Eulemur macaco (2n = 44). These sequences hybridize to the telomeres of
   all chromosomes of the four species and also to the pericentromeres of
   all chromosomes of E. fulvus, E. coronatus and E. macaco, with the
   exception of the pericentromeres of E. coronatus and E. macaco
   chromosomes 9, the homeologous E. fulvus chromosomes 2 and E. macaco
   chromosomes 1. In E. rubriventer only a very weak signal was detected at
   the pericentromeres of a few chromosomes. In E. fulvus, E. coronatus and
   E. macaco, non-telomeric (TTAGGG)(n) sequences collocalize with
   constitutive heterochromatin. The interspecific differences of the
   hybridization pattern of (TTAGGG)(n) sequences at the pericentromeres
   suggest that E. rubriventer branched off the common trunk before
   amplification of endogenous (TTAGGG)(n) sequences occurred in
   pericentromeric regions.},

   Granular structures of A beta-LI were observed in the hippocampus and
   around cerebral microvessels of the SAM after immunohistochemical
   staining with specific anti-A beta antibody. Repeated treatment of the
   SAM with Y-29794 (1, 10, 20 mg/kg, p.o.), a specific inhibitor of prolyl
   endopeptidase, significantly reduced the number and density of A
   beta-positive granular structures in the hippocampus of the SAM, after
   digital image analysis with NIH Image software. Furthermore the
   characteristic biphasic distribution of the digitized density of the
   granules was significantly modulated after the treatment with Y-29794,
   These results suggest ?hat chronic treatment of the SAM with Y-29794, a
   nonpeptide inhibitor of prolyl endopeptidase, prevents the progression
   of A beta-like deposition in the hippocampus of the SAM.},

Title = {Infanticide in seasonally breeding multimale groups of Hanuman langurs
   (Presbytis entellus) in Ramnagar (South Nepal)},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the seasonally breeding langur (Presbytis entellus) population of
   Ramnagar, South Nepal, where multimale groups prevail, 25 attacks on 11
   infants (including one actual killing) by seven adult males were
   witnessed in five groups by six observers between 1990 and 1996.
   Circumstantial evidence also indicates three additional attempts at
   infanticide and in seven additional cases infanticide was presumed or
   likely. Infanticide presumably accounted for 30.8-62.5\% of infant
   mortality in the first 2 years of life. Most attackers (91.4\%) were
   residents of the infants' group and had immigrated after the infants had
   been born (75.0\%) or conceived (25.0\%). Thus, they were not related to
   the victims. The interbirth interval was shortened if an infant died
   either prior to September of its 1st year of life (mean = 1.2 years), or
   its 2nd year (mean = 2.0) and even its 3rd year (mean = 2.4). All
   attackers remained in the group at least until the next mating season;
   high-ranking males maintained their dominance rank and lower-ranking
   males rose in rank. Since rank and mating success were correlated and
   rank and reproductive success might be correlated, all attackers had a
   good chance of siring the next infant of the victims' mothers and could
   thus have benefited by their action. Infanticide seems to be a male
   reproductive strategy at Ramnagar. Infanticide has never before been
   reported among seasonally breeding langurs living at such low densities.
   This is also the first detailed report of infanticide as a male
   reproductive strategy in a seasonally breeding primate population.},

Volume = {103},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Although there is a vast literature on laterality of hand-use in
   nonhuman primates, the Colobinae have been notably overlooked. Ten
   manual activities of differing complexity were studied in five male and
   five female adult Hanuman langurs (Presbytis entellus) from a well
   habituated, wild population at Ramnagar, in southern Nepal. The
   activities recorded were carry, eat, hit, hold, idle, manipulate, reach,
   retrieve, self-groom and social groom. This study aimed to examine
   handedness across tasks and across subjects in a natural population. The
   overall result was a lack of preference for subjects and patterns, Only
   in the eating activity did four individuals show significant hand
   preference, though they were not unidirectional. Eat seemed to be
   loosely associated with hold due to the requirements of the strata which
   the monkeys utilize, These results suggest that hand use is
   unlateralized in P, entellus. Those individuals exhibiting some hand
   preferences can be viewed as statistical exceptions or perhaps subject
   to experiential differences. The results are discussed in terms of their
   evolutionary significance and methodological implications. (C) 1997

Abstract = {Non-flying mammals such as marsupials, primates and rodents have long

   regular visitation to flowers, (2) evidence that mammals carry
   significant loads of pollen, and (3) experimental evidence for
   pollination. Here, we review recent studies that provide these data. It
   is now clear that many species of marsupials and primates are involved
   in pollination in Australia, Africa and South and Central America. We
   also examine earlier contentions that some plants exhibit traits that
   have co-evolved with non-flying mammal pollinators. Much more research
   is still required to understand the importance of these animals in

Abstract = {The last decade has seen a resurgence of interest in laterality of
   function in primates, especially in hand use as it links to handedness
   and language in Homo sapiens. Manual lateralization of behavior in
   humans reflects asymmetry in cerebral structure, which must have evolved
   from nonhuman progenitors. To what extent is hand function lateralized
   in our nearest living relations? First, we address current issues of
   theory and methodology: statistics, measurement, variables, setting,
   sensory modality, and sample size. Specific topics include preference
   vs. performance, posture, bimanuality, inheritance, and arm asymmetry.
   We categorize the published literature in a descriptive, classificatory
   framework of five levels that range from Level 1, ambilaterality, to
   Level 5, human-like handedness. In a meta-analysis we put 241 published
   data-sets to a methodological test of seven criteria and code the 48
   survivors onto the levels framework, by taxonomic grouping (prosimian,
   New World monkey, Old World monkey, ape, chimpanzee). Primates at Level
   1 are mostly wild or naturalistic populations performing spontaneous
   species-typical behavior patterns. Most primates are at Levels 2 and 3,
   that is, individually lateralized to either side, especially on complex,
   demanding or practiced tasks, usually as devised in captive settings.
   Only chimpanzees show signs of population-level bias (Levels 4 and 5) to
   the right, but only in captivity and only incompletely. We conclude that
   nonhuman primate hand function has not been shown to be lateralized at
   the species level-it is not the norm for any species, task, or setting,
   and so offers no easy model for the evolution of human handedness. (C)

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {How small-bodied (500-1,200 g) folivorous prosimian primates cope with
   large amounts of foliage in their diet seasonally has yet to be
   determined for many species such as Hapalemur griseus, which specializes
   on bamboo. To address this issue, we present results on seasonal
   variation in activity and diet from a wild group of H. griseus in
   southeastern Madagascar. Throughout the study (which was conducted from
   July-November 1994 and July 1995-February 1996), H. griseus primarily
   fed on new growth from three species of bamboo: two species of liana
   bamboo and Cephalostachyum perrieri. Bamboo species were used in
   different ways seasonally; liana bamboo was consumed more during the
   dry, cool season, and C. perrieri was eaten more often during the wet,
   warm season. H. griseus also spent more of their time feeding and
   traveling than nocturnal folivores of similar body size during the dry
   season. During the warm wet season, H. griseus decreased the amount of
   time spent feeding and traveling and rested more often. We hypothesize
   that seasonal changes in activity may be primarily related to the
   distribution and availability of food sources and/or reproductive
   cycles. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the occurrence of manual
   laterality in Ateles geoffroyi and in particular to test the influence
   of visual and tactual control on preferential hand use. Thirteen spider
   monkeys were presented with three different food reaching tasks and
   assessed for hand preferences with a minimum of 100 reaches per animal.
   In all three tasks a significant lateral bias towards use of the left
   hand at the group level was found. Performance in visually and tactually
   guided reaching tasks did nut differ with regard to direction or degree
   of manual laterality.
   Males and females showed no significant differences in performance with

Title = {Body size and leaping kinematics in Malagasy vertical clingers and
   leapers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {367-388},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The locomotor category of vertical clingers and leapers has been
   dominated conceptually from the beginning by its small-bodied
   representatives, galagos and tarsiers. Over the years, great
   morphological diversity has been documented within the group, much of it
   size-related. Corresponding behavioral differences remain to be
   explored, in large part because adequate data on the larger-bodied
   species were not available. The primary objective of this paper was to
   characterize the leaping kinematics of indriid primates, the much
   neglected large-bodied vertical clingers and leapers. We videotaped
   leaps of four species of indriids at four different sites in Madagascar:
   Indri indri, Propithecus diadema, Propithecus verreauxi, and Avahi
   laniger. Video images were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively
   after importing them into a computerized measuring program. Ranges of
   motion at the hip joint (a combination of extension, adduction, and
   medial rotation) probably exceed those of tarsiers and galagos. The foot
   of indriids usually releases the grip around the support and contributes
   little or nothing to propulsion, thus supporting the notion that
   indriids are `'hip'' leapers. With the forefoot stationary on the
   support, hindfoot eversion accommodates the adduction and medial
   rotation at the hip during acceleration for take off. Indriid leapers
   can be characterized as `'tarsirotators'' in contrast to
   `'tarsifulcrumating'' galagos and tarsiers. Size-related variation in
   hindlimb kinematics is surprisingly limited within the sample of indriid
   leapers, although acceleration time (the duration of the push off) does
   increase with increasing body size. In addition, forelimb kinematics
   reveal a clear size-related pattern; the smallest indriid species leaps
   with its arms tucked into the chest-like tarsiers and galagos--and the
   larger-bodied indriid species use their arms during acceleration fbr
   rake off as well as to initiate body rotation while airborne. The
   small-bodied species rely exclusively on their tails for this same
   purpose. Whereas relative tail length decreases with increasing body
   size in vertical clingers and leapers, the relative weight of the
   forelimbs increases and makes their action more effective. (C) 1996

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to test the influence of sex, age, social
   rank, matriline membership, posture, and visual and tactual motor
   control on manual preferences in Saimiri sciureus. A well-established
   social group of 12 squirrel monkeys, aged 2 to 14 yrs and consisting of
   two matrilines with social rank known for each animal, was presented
   with four different food-reaching tasks and assessed for hand
   preferences with a minimum of 100 reaches per animal. Frequency of
   occurrence of hand preferences at the group level and degree of hand
   preferences at the individual level depended on posture and on whether
   the reaching act took place under visual or tactual guidance. Sex, age,
   social rank, and matriline membership were not found to determine
   frequency of occurrence, direction or degree of hand preferences with
   the exception of one task in which a significant negative correlation
   between the degree of hand preference and age was found. Nine out of 12
   monkeys showed task-dependent changes in the hand they used
   preferentially while only three animals preferred the same hand in all
   four tasks. Significant preferences for the use of right or left hand on
   a given task were distributed almost equally between individuals. Thus,
   the results of this study suggest task-specific demands like posture
   and/or whether reaching was visually or tactually guided to be the major
   correlates of hand preferences in food-reaching tasks in squirrel
   monkeys.},

Abstract = {The positional behavior and habitat use of a group of white uakaries
   (Cacajao calvus calvus) was observed for 6 weeks in the dry season at
   Lake Teiu, Brazil. Data are presented for feeding, traveling, and
   resting activities. The most common feeding posture is sit, followed by
   stand. Cacajao frequently exhibits locomotor behaviors while in feeding
   trees, using pronograde clamber and quadrupedal walk. The most
   frequently used locomotor behaviors in travel are quadrupedal walk,
   leap, and pronograde clamber. Quadrupedal run and drop also figure
   importantly in the behavioral repertoire. The most frequent resting
   posture was sit, followed by ventral lie. Compared to representative
   members of the other pitheciin genera, Pithecia and Chiropotes, Cacajao
   engages in more locomotion while feeding, and uses more pedal
   suspension. While traveling, pronograde clamber and drop are more
   frequently used by Cacajao. Multiple, deformable supports are used more
   by Cacajao than by the other pitheciins throughout all activities.
   Overall, the positional behavior of Cacajao is more similar to that of
   Chiropotes than of Pithecia. Cacajao's behavioral solutions to the
   problems of balance imposed by its greatly reduced tail are discussed.

Abstract = {Urinary hormone profiles, determined by means of radioimmunoassays, were
   aligned with changes in mating behaviour and vaginal morphology and
   cytology during the ovarian cycles of adult, female lesser bushbabies
   (Galago moholi), a prosimian species. Intromission occurred in all seven
   females, 2.0 +/- 1.1 days (mean +/- SEM, median = 0) after the
   occurrence of vaginal opening, and lasted for 4.1 +/- 0.7 days. Three
   females subsequently gave birth. Vaginal swelling and labial reddening
   were initiated at least 2.5 +/- 0.5 days before vaginal opening and
   lasted 10.4 +/- 0.9 days. Pro-oestrous and vaginal oestrous smears
   coincided with vaginal opening, specifically during the period of
   mating. Concentrations of immunoreactive oestradiol increased during the
   first few days of vaginal opening in one pregnant female-and in the
   nonpregnant females, and coincided with mating. Concentrations of
   immunoreactive progesterone did not show any temporal pattern for either
   pregnant or nonpregnant females. Concentrations of immunoreactive
   testosterone were generally higher during vaginal swelling and opening
   than during the remainder of the cycle in one pregnant female, whereas
   in nonpregnant females, no specific temporal pattern was evident. In
   both pregnant and nonpregnant females, immunoreactive LH concentrations
   increased during the period of vaginal swelling and opening, while in
   nonpregnant females increases were also apparent after vaginal closure.
   The data reported here are preliminary, and further research is
   necessary to establish conclusively patterns of excreted hormones during
   the reproductive cycles of Galago moholi and in other prosimian species.},

Abstract = {Although there have been many studies of the ecology of primates in
   communities throughout the world, there have been few attempts to
   compare community ecology within and among continents. In this study the
   ecological characteristics of the sympatric primate species at eight
   localities-two from each of the major biogeographic areas inhabited by
   primates today-South America, Africa, Madagascar; and Asia-were compared
   using a multivariate technique (principal components analysis of the
   correlation matrix) to summarize the ten dimensional ecological niche
   space. The most striking clustering of species in ecological
   multivariate space is according to phylogeny with closely related
   species showing similar ecological Features. Likewise, the ecological
   characteristics of individual communities are determined by phylogenetic
   groups present at each locality or biogeographic region. As a result,
   communities within any biogeographical region are more similar
   ecologically to one another than to communities from other continental
   areas. In several measures of ecological diversity among the species
   comprising each community, the neotropical communities show lower
   overall diversity than do communities from other continents. (C) 1996

Year = {1996},
Volume = {99},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Fiber architecture of the extensor musculature of the knee and ankle is
   examined in two African guenon species-the semiterrestrial Cercopithecus
   aethiops, and the arboreal C. ascanius. Using histologic and microscopic
   techniques to measure lengths of sarcomeres, the original lengths of
   muscle fasciculi and angles of pinnation in quadriceps femoris and
   triceps surae are reconstructed from direct measurements on cadavers.
   Calculations of reduced physiological cross-sectional area,
   mass/predicted effective tetanic tension, maximum excursion, and tendon
   length/fasciculus + tendon lengths are correlated to preferred locomotor
   modalities in the wild.
   For both species, greater morphological differences occur among the
   bellies of quadriceps femoris-rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, v.
   lateralis, and v. medialis-than among the bellies of triceps
   surae-gastrocnemius lateralis, g. medialis, plantaris, and soleus. With
   regard to quadriceps femoris, few differences occur between species.
   Interspecific differences in the triceps surae indicate (1) redirection
   of muscle force to accommodate arboreality in which the substrate is
   less than body width; (2) muscles more suited for velocity in the
   semiterrestrial vervets; and (3) muscles used more isotonically in
   vervets and more isometrically in red-tailed monkeys. The inherent
   flexibility of muscle may be preadaptive to a primary species shift in
   locomotor modality until the bony morphology is able to adapt through
   natural selection. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Primate social groups frequently contain multiple males. Male group size
   has been hypothesized to result from male mating competition, but the
   selective factors responsible for the evolution of multimale groups are
   unclear. Short breeding seasons create situations that are not conducive
   for single males to monopolize mating access to females, and may
   therefore favor the formation of large male groups. Alternatively, since
   the costs of mate defense increase with the spatial clumping of females,
   female group size may be a primary determinant of the number of males in
   a primate group. We used comparative methods designed to control for the
   potentially confounding effects of hidden third variables associated
   with phylogeny to test the breeding season and female group size
   hypotheses for the evolution of multimale groups. Our results revealed
   no association between breeding season duration and the number of males
   in groups. In contrast, we provide support for the female group size
   hypothesis by demonstrating a strong pattern of correlated evolution
   between female and male group size. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   shown that Microcebus murinus, a nonhuman primate, also develops
   analogous deposits of A beta in the cortical parenchyma and blood vessel
   walls in the brain. Sequence analysis of exons 16 and 17 of the APP
   gene, encoding for A beta, revealed that even if nucleotide divergences
   occurred, the resulting peptide is completely homologous with the human
   A beta. The systematic comparison of the A beta nucleotide sequence in
   microcebes with or without amyloid deposits revealed that neither the
   presence of mutations involved in some cases of early onset familial AD
   nor the presence of a mutational founder effect can explain the
   amyloidosis observed in some old microcebes of our breeding.
   Localization of the APP was performed by immunocytochemistry in the
   brains of adult microcebes (1 to 11 years of age) using two antibodies
   raised against the C-terminus and N-terminus portions of APP.
   Microscopic examinations revealed that in the microcebe the APP
   distribution was similar to that observed in the human: (1) A beta and
   its precursor were simultaneously observed in amyloid plaques (AP) of
   the cortical parenchyma; (2) APP was localized in cell bodies and
   proximal dendrites of neurons, in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and
   in blood vessel and capillary walls; (3) labeling of APP in these
   structures was correlated with the presence of AP; and (4) labeling of
   APP increased with the age of the animal. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

Volume = {7},

Pages = {105-123},
Abstract = {Patterns of three variables of reproductive strategies in male New World
   primates are examined: (i) how males obtain access to potential mates;
   (ii) how males obtain actual mating opportunities; and (iii) how males
   affect infant survival and female reproductive success. Male
   opportunities to associate with females, whether by remaining in their
   natal groups, dispersing and forming new groups, or dispersing and
   taking over or joining established groups, are strongly influenced by
   local population densities and correlate with female reproductive rates
   and the extent of female reproductive seasonality and synchrony.
   Differences in male mating success are affected by female accessibility,
   whether male-male and male-female relationships are hierarchical or
   egalitarian, and whether female reproduction is seasonally restricted.
   Patterns of male behavior toward infants, characterized as active
   assistance, overt interference, or benign tolerance, appear to co-vary
   with differences in the degree to which males can affect female
   reproductive rates.
   These qualitative analyses suggest that the reproductive strategies of
   male New World primates can be classified along a continuum ranging from
   conservative to daring depending on whether female reproductive rates
   are relatively slow or fast and whether reproduction is strongly or
   weakly linked to seasonal ecological variables. Males adopt the
   conservative strategy of staying in their natal groups, forfeiting
   exclusive mating opportunities, and treating infants with tolerance when
   female reproduction is constrained by ecological factors. Conversely,
   males adopt the more daring strategy of dispersing and competing when
   potential payoffs through their ability to affect female reproduction
   are high.},

   four sensors, each of them is composed of two cross polarization active

   `'goniopolarimeter'' we mean a system which determines both arrival
   angles (goniometer function), the type of the mode (O or X), the
   magnitude of this mode and the corresponding Doppler shift. It works
   with known broadcast transmitters and permits measurements over a large
   geographic area. The signal process deals with narrowband signals,
   polarization filtering, nonlinear frequency analysis and interferometry
   technique. We present some experimental results and discuss the

   of southeastern Madagascar beginning in 1986. I report behavioral
   observations on a total of 33 individuals from three groups over a
   9-year span. We captured, marked, and released 21 individuals.
   Individual group size ranged from three to nine sifakas. Two breeding
   females lived in groups I and II until 1993. A newly formed group (III)
   had one breeding female. Age at first reproduction is 4 years for
   females and 5 years for males. Gestation length is 179 days (n = 2).
   Most births occurred in June (n = 17), but infants were also born in May
   (n = 2) and July (n = 2). Nine of 21 (43\%) infants born died before the
   age of I year and 15 (67\%) died before the age of reproduction. One
   female bred in her natal group after the death of the resident male and
   the immigration of an adult male. Another two females disappeared at 4
   and 5 years of age; they could have emigrated or died. All
   5-to-6-year-old males (n = 4) have emigrated from their natal groups to
   adjacent groups. Two have committed infanticide. Five or more
   individuals were killed by Cryptoprocta ferox. Despite high mortality
   and offspring dispersal, the number of individuals in the two main
   groups remained nearly the same over the 9-year study.},

Abstract = {Subfossil specimens of Indri indri have been recovered recently from the
   Ankarana Massif cave system in the far north of Madagascar. Taken
   together with material from the central highland site of Ampasambazimba,
   the range of this species appears to have once included much of the
   northern half of the island and to have extended north and west beyond
   the eastern rainforest (not unlike Hapalemur simus), It is probable that
   forest corridors connected the subfossil localities to the current range
   at some time in the past. Climatic desiccation (fluctuating or
   long-term) and/or human degradation of the environment may have created
   the disjunct distributions of living and subfossil I. indri. It is also
   possible that I. indri once included populations or subspecies that were
   better adapted to dry forest, woodland, or mosaic environments, habitats
   very different from those occupied by their living conspecifics. Such
   adaptive diversity would have been similar to that of Propithecus
   diadema which today has subspecies in the montane forests and one (P.d.
   perrieri) in the dry forests of the northeast. These discoveries add new
   information on range extensions to the distributional database for the
   primates of Madagascar, and illustrate the piecemeal process of their
   extinctions. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Our current knowledge about the forces leapers generate and absorb is
   very limited and based exclusively on rigid force platform measurements.
   In their natural environments, however, leapers take off and land on
   branches and tree trunks, and these may be compliant. We evaluated the
   influence of substrate properties on leaping kinetics in prosimian
   leapers by using a combined field and laboratory approach. Tree sway and
   the timing of takeoffs relative to the movements of trees were
   documented for animals under natural conditions in Madagascar. Field
   data collected on three species (Indri indri, Propithecus diadema,
   Propithecus verreauxi) indicate that in the majority of takeoffs, the
   substrate sways and the animals takeoff before the elastic rebound of
   the substrate. This implies that force is `'wasted'' to deform supports.
   Takeoff and landing forces were measured in an experimental setting with
   a compliant force pole at the Luke University Primate Center. Forces
   were recorded for 2 Propithecus verreauxi and 3 Hapalemur griseus. Peak
   takeoff forces were 9.6 (P. verreauxi) and 10.3 (H. griseus) times body
   weight, whereas peak landing forces were 6.7 (P. verreauxi) and 8.4 (H.
   griseus) times body weight. As part of the impulse generated does not
   translate into leaping distance but is used to deform the pole, greater
   effort is required to reach a given target substrate, and, consequently,
   takeoff forces are high. The landing forces, on the other hand, are
   damped by the pole/substrate yield that increases the time available for
   deceleration. Our results contrast with previous studies of leaping
   forces recorded with rigid platform measuring systems that usually
   report higher landing than takeoff forces. We conclude that 1) Leapers
   generate and are exposed to exceptionally high locomotory forces. The
   takeoff forces are higher than the landing forces when using compliant
   supports, indicating that the takeoff rather than the landing may be
   critical in interpreting leaping behavior and related aspects of
   musculoskeletal design. 2) Large-bodied vertical clingers and leapers do
   not usually take advantage of the elastic energy stored in substrates.
   Rather, force (and energy) is wasted to deform compliant supports. 3) A
   compliant force pole approximates the conditions faced by large-bodied
   vertical clingers and leapers in the wild more closely than do rigid
   force platforms. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   age, sex, and hand preference indicated that the adult males both

   as a group did not show a trend in the direction of handedness. However,
   individual adult females showed consistent right- or left-hand
   preference. Younger sifakas tended toward ambipreference, suggesting
   that lateralization of hand preference is gradual, becoming more stable
   in adulthood. These findings suggest that sex and age may be strong

Abstract = {Manual laterality of cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) was observed
   for five different types of reaching. The tamarins displayed
   species-level right-handedness for spontaneous grasping for food but not
   for one-arm vertical suspension or any of 3 other types of elicited
   reaching. The results showed that difficult or novel tasks are neither
   necessary nor sufficient for the emergence of species-level handedness.
   Accuracy in retrieving food from a rotating platform was greatest (a)
   for highly lateralized tamarins, (b) when the preferred hands were used
   for reaching, (c) for young tamarins, and (d) when the tamarins stood on
   a narrow, unstable platform instead of a wide, stable one. The results
   suggest that evolution of species-level handedness is dependent on prior
   natural selection for increased manual performance that accompanies
   strongly lateralized hand preferences.},

Title = {APPLICATION OF FECAL STEROID TECHNIQUES TO THE REPRODUCTIVE
   ENDOCRINOLOGY OF FEMALE VERREAUX SIFAKA (PROPITHECUS-VERREAUXI)},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {313-325},
Abstract = {Solid phase extraction, high performance liquid chromatography, and
   radioimmunoassay were used to test the validity of fecal steroid
   analysis for assessing ovarian function in sifaka (Propithecus
   verreauxi). Daily fecal samples were collected over a 4 month period
   from two cycling female sifaka, and single samples were collected from
   females during normal gestation and males while housed at the Duke
   University Primate Center. Tests of radioimmunoassay validity indicated
   that solid phase extraction and microradioimmunoassay techniques were
   reliable and accurate methods for quantifying ovarian steroids in sifaka
   feces. The progesterone (P-4) antibody specifically quantitated only
   P-4, while several estrogen metabolites made small contributions to
   immunoreactive measures of estradiol (E(2)). A 1:10 dilution reduced
   these contributions to 3-15\% of the estimated E(2) concentration.
   Although the spectral data suggested that E(2) was not the major
   metabolite present, it accounted for the majority of the
   immunoreactivity at normal assay dilutions. Fecal profiles of
   immunoreactive E(2) and P-4 in the conceptive female resembled serum
   profiles of other strepsirhines. E(2) and P-4 were elevated at the end
   of the conceptive cycle and were more markedly increased in late
   pregnancy in the two pregnant females. Mating behavior and indices of
   sexual interest were observed in conjunction with E(2) peaks, although
   not all peaks were accompanied by observations of sexual behavior. (C)

   long bones},
Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {65},
Number = {4},
Pages = {181-201},
Abstract = {Recent examinations of the functional morphology underlying strepsirhine
   primate leaping behaviors have identified several cross-sectional
   features of long bones that can be associated with interspecific
   differences in leaping frequency and/or body size. In this study the
   cross-sectional parameters of strepsirhine fore- and hindlimb long bones
   are examined relative to body weight, bone length, phylogenetic
   affiliation, leaping frequency and landing kinematics. Humeral
   cross-sectional morphology is conservative relative to both phylogenetic
   and functional groupings. As a result, humeral cross-sectional area
   should prove useful as a size surrogate in future comparative studies.
   After the effects of bone length and body weight are controlled,
   `frequent' leapers have stronger and more rigid femoral and tibial
   midshafts than do `less-frequent' leapers. Landing style is conflated
   with leaping frequency and it is difficult to explain morphological
   variation exclusively by either leaping frequency or landing style.
   Further behavioral research, especially field study of locomotion, is
   needed to disentangle the effects of these mechanically important
   aspects of leaping locomotion.},

Abstract = {I present quantitative and qualitative data on infant caretaking
   behaviors collected during a preliminary field study of spectral
   tarsiers (Tarsius spectrum) in a northern Sulawesi rain forest.  The
   primary goal of the study is to identify the basic pattern of infant
   care in this species.  I studied tarsiers at Tangkoko-Dua Saudara Nature
   Reserve in Sulawesi, Indonesia, from May to July 1992.  I observed two
   infants, from two groups for a total of 96 hr using focal follows. 
   During individual focal follows, ranging from 20 min to 6 hr, I recorded
   behaviors at 5-min intervals.  I also recorded distances of group
   members relative to the infant at 5-min intervals.  I subsampled the
   data at 35-min intervals to control for statistical autocorrelation
   between data points.  Infants were alone between 40 and 50\% of the
   time.  The two subadults were more frequently in proximity to the infant
   than the adult males, the nonmaternal adult female, or the mothers were.
   This pattern of the subadults maintaining proximity to the infant
   continued when the mothers were absent.  These results suggest that
   subadults may be guarding or babysitting infants.  It is also possible
   that subadults are not traveling as far from the sleeping site as adults
   do and are therefore more likely to be found in association with the
   infant.},

Abstract = {Urine collected from New World monkeys (tufted capuchin, squirrel
   monkey, cotton-top tamarin) and Old World monkeys (rhesus macaque,
   Japanese macaque), was used as the odor stimuli. Two adult tufted
   capuchins were trained on a successive odor-discrimination task with two
   odors, 30 trials each, in one session per day. Responses to one of the
   two odors (S+) were reinforced by sweet water. The monkeys failed to
   discriminate between the urine from the two species of macaques but
   could discriminate among the urine from the three species of New World
   monkeys. Furthermore, similarity of urine odors was analyzed by
   multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) and a cluster analysis. These analysis
   suggested that the tufted capuchin can distinguish differences among New
   World monkeys but not between the macaques. The natural distribution of
   the tufted capuchin overlaps with that of other New World monkeys, but
   it does not overlap with those of Old World monkeys. Consequently, it
   can be concluded that this difference in olfactory recognition in the
   tufted capuchin reflects their sympatric and allopatric relationships
   with other species.},

Abstract = {The fatty acid composition of milk fat is known to be affected by
   dietary and genetic differences, while the milk triacylglycerol
   structure is believed to be attuned to the needs of the subsequent
   lipolysis during gastrointestinal passage. The availability of milk
   samples from eight species of prosimian primates, whose milk
   triacylglycerol structure had not been analyzed, offered an opportunity
   to further assess these ideas. The milk samples were collected by manual
   expression and the lipids extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1,
   vol/vol). The lipid classes were resolved by thin-layer chromatography,
   and the neutral lipids subjected to detailed analyses by capillary
   gas-liquid chromatography of fatty acids and molecular species of
   triacylglycerols using nonpolar and polarizable liquid phases. The milk
   samples were found to differ greatly in total fat content (4-73\%) and
   in the composition of the neutral lipid classes and molecular species.
   The concentration of triacylglycerols ranged from 88-95\%, free fatty
   acids from 0.5-10\%, alkyldiacylglycerols from 0.5-5.0\%, and
   diacylglycerols, monoacylglycerol and free and esterified cholesterol
   made up the remainder. The fatty acid chain length ranged from C-8-C-24,
   With palmitic (16-31\%) and oleic (13-40\%) acids being the major
   components in most of the species. In all instances, the molecular
   association of the fatty acids differed from random distribution by a
   higher proportion of the monoacid (trioleoyl) and diacid
   (dipalmitoyloleoyl) glycerols. The phylogenetic influences on neutral
   milk lipid composition, however, remained unclear, as some of the
   differences between closely related species were greater than those
   between more distantly related ones.},

Abstract = {Despite the extensive electromyographic research that has addressed limb
   muscle function during primate quadrupedalism, the role of the back
   muscles in this locomotor behavior has remained undocumented. We report
   here the results of an electromyographic (EMG) analysis of three
   intrinsic back muscles (multifidus, longissimus, and iliocostalis) in
   the baboon (Papio anubis), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), and orangutan
   (Pongo pygmaeus) during quadrupedal walking. The recruitment patterns of
   these three back muscles are compared to those reported for the same
   muscles during nonprimate quadrupedalism. In addition, the function of
   the back muscles during quadrupedalism and bipedalism in the two
   hominoids is compared. Results indicate that the back muscles restrict
   trunk movements during quadrupedalism by contracting with the touchdown
   of one or both feet, with more consistent activity associated with
   touchdown of the contralateral foot. Moreover, despite reported
   differences in their gait preferences and forelimb muscle EMG patterns,
   primates and nonprimate mammals recruit their back muscles in an
   essentially similar fashion during quadrupedal walking. These
   quadrupedal EMG patterns also resemble those reported for chimpanzees,
   gibbons and humans (but not orangutans) walking bipedally. The
   fundamental similarity in back muscle function across species and
   locomotor behaviors is consistent with other data pointing to
   conservatism in the evolution of the neural control of tetrapod limb
   movement, but does not preclude the suggestion (based on forelimb muscle
   EMG and spinal lesion studies) that some aspects of primate neural
   circuitry are unique. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Retinal projections to several telencephalic structures have been
   demonstrated in a wide range of mammalian species following intraocular
   injections of tritiated amino acids and cholera toxin subunit-B
   conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Since these regions are also
   innervated by olfactory fibers, we investigated the distribution of
   convergent projections using simultaneous injections of different
   anterograde tracers in the eye and olfactory bulbs. Convergent
   projections from the retina and from the olfactory bulbs were observed
   in the piriform cortex, olfactory tubercle, the cortical region of the
   medial amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and the bed nucleus of the stria
   terminalis. A few retinal fibers also invade the nucleus of the lateral
   olfactory tract, the bed nucleus of the accessory olfactory bulb and the
   diagonal band of Broca. Injections of retrograde tracers in the medial
   amygdala, the bed nucleus or the lateral hypothalamus shows that the
   visuo-olfactory convergence mainly involves projections originating from
   the accessory olfactory bulb, and to a lesser extent from the
   ventromedial region of the main olfactory bulb. Fewer than 20
   retinotelencephalic ganglion cells were identified in the retina, mainly
   located contralateral to the injection site. Ganglion cells were medium
   sized and possessed two long slender opposing dendrites. These retinal
   and olfactory projections could provide an anatomical substrate for the
   modulation of gonadotropin hormone levels and the olfactory influence on
   light mediated rhythms related to reproductive physiology.},

   conditions in 40 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and 9 orangutans (Pongo

   indicated no population preference during quadrupedal reaching but a
   right-hand population preference was found during upright reaching.
   There were no significant effects of age or sex on either the direction
   or strength of hand preference. Early rearing history affected the
   strength of hand preference but not direction. The results suggest that
   posture is an important factor in the assessment of hand preference in
   great apes and may have important evolutionary consequences.},

Abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this investigation was the determination of
   the lactate threshold (LT) by selected respiratory gas exchange measures
   and venous blood lactate levels during incremental load work on a
   mechanically braked cycle ergometer.
   Design: Repeated measures design.
   Setting: Human Performance Laboratory.
   Participants: Eight healthy trained soccer players (mean age 21.9 +/-
   3.0 yr, mean VO2max = 59.2 +/- 3.6 ml.kg.min-1).
   Outcome Measure: Subjects conducted two incremental load work tests.
   Incremental load work was increased by 1 kilopond (kp) every third
   minute at 60 rpm until voluntary exhaustion. Blood samples from a
   forearm vein were collected during the second trial (T2) only and
   analyzed for lactic acid {[}LA-].
   Results: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures
   indicated no statistically significant difference between the two tests
   for maximal oxygen uptake (Vo2max), maximal carbon dioxide production
   (Vco2max), maximal heart rate (HRmax), maximal pulmonary ventilation
   (V(E)BTPSmax) and lowest ventilatory equivalent of oxygen (V(E)/Vo2),
   respectively; however, there was a significant difference among the
   oxygen uptake (Vo2) values at the LT for the four determination methods.
   In our subjects, the measured (mean +/- SD) V(E)/Vo2 in relation to Vo2
   for the first trial (T1) of 22.9 +/- 1.9 occurred at Vo2 of 1.27 +/- 0.8
   1.min-1. The lowest V(E)/Vo2 and the onset of {[}LA-1 accumulation
   calculated from individual exponential equations relating V(E) to Vo2
   yielded Vo2 values of 1.77 +/- 0. 18 and 1.74 +/- 0.25 1. min-1 for the
   T2. Utilizing natural log for lactate In {[}LA-] to natural log for In
   (Vo2) equations, the LT for T2 occurred at Vo2 of 1.30 +/- 0.70 1.
   min-1.
   Conclusion: LT was best predicted by the measured lowest V(E)/Vo2 and
   the plot of the in {[}LA-] to In Vo2 relationship. The methods used in
   this study provide a valid estimate of the LT and support the use of
   measured lowest V(E)/Vo2 as an indirect measure of the LT.},

Abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this investigation was to induce elevated
   plasma concentrations of potassium (K+) efflux from active muscle cells
   during intense muscular exercise. The relationship between K+, pulmonary
   ventilation (V(E)) and EKG changes, specifically T-wave amplitude. is
   presently controversial.
   Design: Repeated measures design.
   Setting: Human performance laboratory.
   Participants: Twelve volunteer trained recreational cyclists (10 males.
   mean age 31.9 +/- 7.4, and 2 females, mean age 27.5 +/- 0.7, mean Vo2max
   571.2 +/- 6.4 ml. kg . min-1).
   Outcome Measure: Subjects performed 10 min of pedaling at 90 rpm,
   yielding a power output of 45 W. min-1 on a mechanically braked cycle
   ergometer as a warm-up. Each exercise stage was 2 min in duration,
   beginning at 135 W and increased by 45 W thereafter until voluntary
   exhaustion. Respiratory gas exchange measures were obtained every 10
   sec. Venous blood samples for K+ and lactate (LA-) determination were
   drawn at rest, at the end of stage 2, all subsequent stages, and during
   3 and 10 min of recovery. EKG recordings were concurrent with venous
   sampling.
   Results: Statistical analyses for V(E) vs. K+, respiratory exchange
   ratio (RER) vs. K+ and RER vs. LA- revealed neither significant change
   nor an associative relationship from stages 1-3. However, stages 4-8
   were statistically significant (p < .05) and highly correlated. No
   relationship was found between K+ change and T-wave amplitude during
   exercise or recovery.
   Conclusion: These data indicate a strong relationship between selected
   respiratory gas exchange measures and K+ during intermediate to highly
   intense exercise.},

Abstract = {Understanding the information conveyed by animal signals requires
   studies of both production and perception. It is important to determine
   the relationship between signal morphology and the circumstances of
   production, the way signaller behavior varies with motivational state
   and the role of context in mediating responses to signals. Alarm calls
   are well-suited to research of this type because they are widespread in
   birds and mammals and typically evoke unambiguous responses. We review
   studies of alarm calling in primates and ground-dwelling sciurid
   rodents, concentrating especially on whether these signal systems may be
   viewed as `functionally referential', that is, as conveying sufficient
   information about an event for receivers to select appropriate
   responses. Comparisons of the physical, behavioral and habitat
   characteristics of these species suggest that incompatibility of the
   escape responses required to avoid different classes of predators may
   have been an important factor in the evolution of functionally
   referential alarm calls.},

Abstract = {Affinitive contact between former opponents soon after a conflict has
   been demonstrated in a growing number of primate species. Several recent
   studies show that such contact reduces the probability of future
   conflicts, allows the recipient of aggression to reduce its anxiety, and
   restores tolerance between former opponents. Hence, these contacts can
   be termed reconciliation. In this paper, we critically discuss common
   methodological problems of studying reconciliation, examine functional
   aspects, and evaluate the existing variation in primate reconciliation
   in light of predictions derived from four untested hypotheses about its
   evolutionary origins. We find that the occurrence of reconciliation in
   primates is not limited to anthropoids. Neither is it limited to species
   with formalized dominance relations. Reconciliation is also not a
   prerequisite for life in permanent social groups. Instead, several lines
   of evidence support the hypothesis that reconciliation serves to
   maintain valuable social relationships between individuals. We suggest
   several more specific versions of this hypothesis and discuss
   reconciliation between kin, mates, and alliance partners, as well as a
   number of open questions pertaining to the mechanisms, functions and
   origins of reconciliation among primates.},

Abstract = {Adrenal and gonadal hormone levels were evaluated in representative
   species from Prosimii, Ceboidea, Cercopithecoidea, and Hominoidea to
   determine if endocrine activity was influenced by phylogenetic factors.
   Most small-bodied New World primates had extremely high levels of
   cortisol, progesterone, and testosterone when compared with Old World
   primates. In contrast to the high hormone levels and diversity found in
   Ceboidea, Old World primates showed a more similar pattern of hormone
   secretion. Thus, this survey supports earlier reports indicating that
   the callitricids and smaller cebid monkeys have a distinctive hormone
   profile. Although higher hormone levels tended to be associated with
   lower body weight, this effect was not evident in all taxa, and there
   were many notable exceptions. When species differ from their predicted
   hormone levels based on phylogenetic heritage and body weight (e.g.,
   titi monkeys), we must look for other biological factors that influence
   endocrine activity.},

Abstract = {Asymmetrical hand use by rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) was
   investigated in a series of tactually and visually guided tasks. The 1st
   experiment recorded manual preferences of 29 monkeys for solving a
   haptic discrimination task in a hanging posture. There was a left-hand
   population bias: 21 monkeys had a left-hand bias, 4 a right-hand bias,
   and 4 no bias. The 2nd experiment, 4 tasks with 23 to 51 monkeys,
   investigated the critical components of the 1st experiment by varying
   the posture (hanging, sitting, or tripedal) and the sensory requirements
   (tactile or visual). Posture influenced hand bias, with a
   population-level left-hand bias in hanging and sitting postures, but an
   almost symmetrical distribution in the tripedal posture. A left-hand
   bias was found for both sensory modalities, but the bias was stronger in
   the tactual tasks. Results suggest a possible right-hemisphere
   specialization in the rhesus for tactile, visual, or spatial processing.},

Title = {MONITORING OVARIAN-FUNCTION IN CAPTIVE AND FREE-RANGING WILDLIFE BY

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Methods for monitoring and assessing reproductive status have been
   developed to allow both captive and free-ranging wildlife to be
   evaluated while avoiding chemical immobilization or physical restraint. 
   The broad application of these methods to a wide range of species is
   related to the conservation of the steroid hormone molecule across taxa
   and the stability of steroid hormone metabolites in the excreta.  In
   general, conjugated steroid hormone metabolites of the sex steroids are
   measured in the urine, whereas the unconjugated metabolites are measured
   in feces; both methods are used to monitor gonadal function or
   pregnancy.  Most methods are appropriate for monitoring females and
   measure metabolites of estradiol or progesterone.  The measurement of
   metabolites of testosterone to monitor testicular activity in males has
   been used, but to a lesser degree.  When correctly applied, these
   approaches allow the assessment of reproductive function for prolonged
   time periods, which permits the objective description of cyclic
   physiologic processes or the detection of infrequent events.  A
   relatively large number of zoo species have been studied, and valid
   methods and baseline data exist for many nondomestic primates and
   ungulates.  Although a smaller number of free-ranging wildlife species
   have been characterized at this time, the current trend indicates
   increased application of these methods in this research area.},

Abstract = {In a captive group of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), consisting
   of six group members and the three infants of the two breeding females,
   we analyzed participation of all group members in infant carrying, and
   suckling by the two breeding females. During the first two weeks of the
   infants' lives, the two breeding females carried their own infant(s)
   almost exclusively due primarily to the mutual avoidance by the two
   females. At the beginning of the third week of the infants' lives nearly
   all group members began to carry all infants to a relatively high degree
   and both breeding females suckled all infants. The results indicate that
   the greater energetic demands in rearing three infants simultaneously
   are compensated by an extended division of labor among group members.
   All breeding animals preferred to carry and to suckle the infants
   according to kinship predictions. However, observed preferences of
   nonbreeding group members in infant carrying seemed not to be related to
   different degrees of genetic relatedness.},
